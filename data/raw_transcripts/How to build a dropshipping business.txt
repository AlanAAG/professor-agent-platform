Mr. Ishan Sur
0:37
No, no, he was on. All right, folks.
0:46
All of you had a nice lunch. You all seem quite energetic from the last
0:52
session that we had. Remember Kiti mentioned that
0:57
we have a faculty coming in someone who is an expert in drop shipping has run
1:02
multiple businesses not just in India but different countries from Dubai to
1:07
Europe to Asia he knows it all. If I have everyone's attention please
1:14
welcome Ishan Suri Okay, good afternoon guys. How's
1:25
everyone doing? Awesome. So, uh I had a class with the
1:30
first session at 12. Uh we had a fun time. Um and my week for the ne my goal
1:35
for the next few weeks is to be sharing my drop shipping journey uh in the last
1:40
5 years and how I can help you do the same. So um before we get started I
1:46
by the way can we do we have the clicker now or or is it okay cool? Yeah. So
1:51
before we get started I want to walk you through some stuff my journey personally
1:55
because it's going to all make sense. Um so yeah this is uh when I started uh
2:02
basically passed out of uni fresh just like you guys uh will be in the next
2:06
couple of years. Um the next thing is a picture of me uh I I got this job at at
2:12
a hotel management traininey role something that I completely hated and I
2:16
quit in 29 days and I remember asking myself like is this what you know
2:21
working is going to be like which is pretty terrible. Um after that how many
2:25
of you have heard of of course chatbots right like many chat. So back in 2015
2:29
when people didn't know how to scan a QR code um I worked at this AI chatbot
2:33
company called Hey Mojo. I was a product manager and scaled my way up to a
2:38
marketing director but you know I always asked myself like there has to be more.
2:42
I wanted to create something of my own and then I started pondering on the
2:46
options that I had with the minimum budget that I had at that time which
2:50
most people do. Um, so this was my first uh e-commerce brand which was a
2:56
streetear apparel brand in the US called Notorious. How many of you listen to
3:00
rap? Okay, so MGK wore one of our t-shirts
3:05
which is pretty cool. Um, someone just someone from his team just picked it out
3:09
of our website. But again, this was a street wear apparel brand uh that we
3:13
started in the US. Everything you see here was basically designed by me,
3:18
sourced by me, and I have no design experience. The point I'm trying to make
3:21
is, you know, when you start drop shipping, you kind of learn everything
3:24
on the fly. We eventually um ended up selling the business, and this wasn't by
3:31
it. It wasn't something that I planned. Someone just reached out to me and was
3:35
like, "Hey, we like what you're doing and would you sell the business?" And I
3:38
was like, "Okay, so someone can buy my business." Like of course I know
3:42
business are sold but this is a 6-month job and someone just came in uh from the
3:46
US and was like I'm interested to buy your business. This was a big validation
3:51
for me because essentially it u told me that this is a real business right it
3:55
helps me uh and it gave me that bankroll to to kind of scale my businesses
3:59
further which is what we did. So then I took drop shipping seriously and we
4:03
scaled uh our drop shipping businesses across the big four markets which is US,
4:07
UK, Canada and Australia. uh we got serious about our teams. In the
4:12
beginning, I was doing everything which is a lot like what you all would do. So,
4:16
building your own website, running your own ads, shooting your own creatives.
4:20
But then I kind of optimized my processes, hired a team, uh built a
4:24
dedicated team around different departments. We went to a micro branded
4:29
approach, which is essentially not the typical take a product, sell it, but
4:32
brand the entire thing. And through that, we were able to scale our business
4:36
to $40,000 a day USD every single day. So, we were doing a million dollar
4:40
months um in a span of like 15 months from me starting. Now, that was
4:45
obviously some serious money being made through uh drop shipping, which people
4:49
think isn't a real business. You'll hear people say that, right? Uh but the only
4:52
way it happened was when we got serious about our processes, systems and um yeah
4:58
this is again this is a black Friday screenshot that we had and you guys are
5:03
in a really good space right now because let me tell you this Q4 is October,
5:07
November, December and the amount of money people make in drop shipping in
5:10
these three months they don't make the entire year. So you have Black Friday
5:13
coming up, you have Cyber Monday, you have Halloween, you have Christmas, you
5:16
have the New Year's. So this is literally the best time to start a drop
5:19
shipping business and we're sitting in September, right? So that's pretty cool.
5:24
Now once I started doing well, I had people reach out to me and they were
5:27
like, can you help me uh build my own drop shipping business? And I was like,
5:31
why not? So we started a net company. I mentored close to 1500 students in 40
5:36
countries. These weren't actually students. They were actual entrepreneurs
5:39
who were struggling to scale. Um, so let's say people who were doing $30 to
5:43
$50,000 a month but wanted to scale to $500,000 a month. So this is me helping
5:48
them do that. This is someone from Australia called Shaheen. I don't know
5:51
if you guys can see this but he scaled his business to about 160 grand a month.
5:55
This is uh Sophie uh the one before that Sophie uh who was doing about three
6:02
grand a day in just Italy the market. Okay. Uh the next one is actually the
6:06
one which was the breakout. So, we had Jordan, this is our Discord chat, and he
6:11
was doing $700,000 a month in sales, which I think is uh absolutely crazy. He
6:16
was netting like 20% of that. So, 140 grand profit clean. Okay. So,
6:24
so yeah, I want to talk about what I'm doing right now. This was about 3 4
6:27
years back. Right now I'm running uh a company called AER which is a house of
6:32
drop shipping businesses across the world in 30 countries including Dubai
6:36
including the west um including even places in the east. I'm also building an
6:42
edtech startup called ecom edge where we basically teach people how to build an
6:47
online businesses from scratch and these are not people who are techsavvy. I have
6:50
people in the community who are like 70 years old who've not sent more than 50
6:53
emails but they want to build an online business. So we have that we have close
6:57
to 2 and a half thousand members in the community right now. The next thing I do
7:02
is also a year and a half back I started creating some content. Okay. I was like
7:06
I want to build my personal brand. Uh and we have a community close to almost
7:10
a million people which is one of the fastest growing e-commerce drop shipping
7:14
communities in the world. So that's my page of course. This is Ecom Edge. Um
7:18
and I just want to focus on how important it is to build a personal
7:22
brand in 2025. It's a topic for another day, but if you guys want any help, some
7:26
of you are probably already doing it, creating content, you can always come to
7:29
me because creating a personal brand has opened doors for me that and it's not
7:35
just about getting views and likes and followers, right? That you can maybe,
7:38
you know, flex it at a party. It's about opening doors to investor meetings that
7:42
I've never would have got. Uh when I walk into a room, people know me for a
7:46
certain reason and I get some sort of a privilege there. The reason why I'm
7:50
standing here right now in front of you guys is because of the personal brand.
7:52
So I feel like building a personal brand helps you with your businesses and I
7:56
would highly I think of course you got guys like Nas teaching you that stuff.
8:00
So that's pretty cool. But again I'm lastly building a DTC brand in the home
8:05
cleaning niche. Um for the last four or five years I have been drop shipping but
8:11
my goal was always to build a brand a brand I can exit for tens of millions of
8:17
dollars. Right. Um but I also understood that 97% of D2C brands fail.
8:22
So what I thought to myself is like how do I improve my odds of success because
8:27
I cannot be 100% successful. And that's what drop shipping teaches you because
8:31
you learn everything. You learn marketing, you learn ops, you learn
8:34
media buying, you learn content creation, you learn everything. And we
8:39
set up our own factory by the way. We set up our own factory. So you also
8:42
understand offline. It's one of the very few online models which also connects
8:46
you to the offline world because for example if you have an agency and you
8:49
sell services to clients right you probably run their social it's a social
8:54
media agency you charge a certain amount of money and you you know it's it's a
8:57
good business but you don't understand offline so drop shipping is one of the
9:01
very few businesses which you can start which connects offline and online which
9:04
I think is pretty cool and I started with about $2,400 5 years back because
9:09
again when you're starting out you don't have a business uh you don't have a lot
9:12
of capital um and you kind of go and look at options which are available for
9:18
yourself in terms of what businesses to start. This is a picture of me actually
9:23
back then we didn't have like a lot of these famous uh like cool AI tools,
9:26
project management tools. So this is this was like my marketing plan on a
9:30
whiteboard and I was able to turn 2400 into $12 million in 5 years, right? So,
9:36
and it gave me amazing opportunities like talking at TED, uh, which is
9:40
something that I've always looked forward to hosting online events with
9:42
thousands of people involved. And guys, the only reason I'm telling you this is
9:47
not to brag or flex, but to show you how learning one business model made all of
9:53
this happen. And let me explain even about the personal brand. We went from
9:58
zero to 100K followers in 50 days organically without zero ads. Okay? And
10:03
the only reason that happened is because when I was drop shipping, I understood
10:07
the algorithm because organic, inorganic, same [ __ ] Like a hook is a
10:12
hook. You understand? If it's a real or it's an ad, it's a hook. How do you reel
10:15
the customer in? How do you increase average watch time? So, I used the same
10:19
fundamentals that I used in drop shipping while I started creating my
10:23
personal brand. And that helped me. We're at six and a we're at 650K right
10:27
now in like a year. We'll be hitting a million by the end of this year. And the
10:30
reason was drop shipping, right? Um, so you learn so many things about the art
10:37
of selling online. And I think in today's age, if you master this skill,
10:41
uh, then you master everything. And drop shipping teaches you that. But it only
10:44
doesn't teach you the art of selling online, but the art of selling online
10:48
connected with the offline part of things because you're going to be
10:51
working with suppliers, you're going to be um, you know, visiting factories,
10:54
seeing samples. There's so much that's going to happen. So this is super super
10:57
important. So my goal for the following weeks with
11:02
you all uh and the other badge is to help you grow from where you are right
11:06
now. Now that could be anywhere. Maybe you've built your website, maybe you
11:11
have done nothing yet or maybe you found a product you already doing sales. How
11:14
many of you where you at? Who's found a product yet or looked for a product?
11:20
Uh no, just just look for a product that Okay, there was someone sitting over
11:22
here in the last batch. He showed me his product like this is what I'm going to
11:24
sell, you know. Okay, so we've got a few people. Um, sure. So, okay, who does not
11:31
know what drop shipping is? Okay, everyone knows what drop shipping
11:34
is. I'm going to get into the basics too, guys, because I want this to be for
11:38
everyone. But to help you grow from where you are right now, wherever there
11:41
is, right? Using some of the lessons I've learned, the hard way in a few
11:47
stories to make it stick. So let's imagine if you are right now over here
11:51
wherever there is and then take you from where you are right now to a sixf
11:56
figureure entrepreneur at least which is $100,000. So tell me who's excited for
12:01
that. Awesome. So I'm going to keep it basic
12:08
because again my job is to design it for the person who doesn't even know the D
12:12
of drop shipping. So I'm going to start with the introduction why this business
12:15
model still win in wins in today's market. Um and the reason for that is
12:21
uh it's low capital requirements. You start your business with minimal upfront
12:25
investment. You have minimum financial risk. You can you hold no inventory.
12:28
That's the whole point of drop shipping. So you hold no inventory and therefore
12:30
you can test multiple products. You can't do that anywhere else. Uh you have
12:34
a simple tech stack. You don't need like a core a team of developers. You you can
12:38
just build [ __ ] yourself and put it to test and make money. Right? there's
12:41
scalable growth um and there's global accessibility which is basically you can
12:46
work from wherever you want with whoever you want and whenever you want because
12:50
it's uh you can run out of a laptop basically right now the strengths um
12:55
well it's lower foundations so even if you fail you have room for failure in
13:00
most businesses if you put in a lot of money and you fail maybe if it's a tech
13:03
startup or I'm not taking a [ __ ] on tech startups but I'm just saying like
13:08
the margin for error in most businesses are very very low whereas drop shipping
13:11
you can literally fail 10 times, get it right the 11th time and be successful.
13:15
Um that's the case in most businesses but the cost associated with failing 10
13:20
times is a lot in other businesses compared to drop shipping, right? So the
13:22
next thing is minimal capital entry. Uh you just need an idea, a laptop and
13:26
Wi-Fi. So it's pretty basic, right? You have light infrastructure, no
13:29
warehouses, no logistics. I'll give you an example. The first quarter million
13:33
dollars I made, I made it with myself and one virtual assistant. That's it. I
13:38
didn't have a team. It was just me and one more person who by the way I've
13:41
never met some person in the Philippines. Okay. Um the next thing is
13:45
zero inventory burden. You don't have any inventory because most of your cash
13:49
like I'm building a DTC brand right now and 60 to 70% of my cash flow is in
13:54
inventory. Correct. Um so you have zero inventory.
13:58
Um so yeah this is how it moves guys. The customer places his order, you
14:03
forward it to your supplier. uh he ships your order directly to the customer from
14:08
the warehouse. You keep your profits. You give the supplier the cost. And
14:12
that's pretty much what drop shipping is in a nutshell.
14:16
Now, I think this is pretty important. Um I want to tell you guys where the
14:21
pitfalls are right now and to be wary of them because I learned it the hard way.
14:27
I literally fell in, came out, fell in again and and it was and it costed me a
14:32
lot of time. So out of the three over here, all three are pretty bad, but I
14:36
would say these two, which is ad platform bans and payment processor
14:40
flags are the worst. I want to talk about the payment processing first.
14:44
You're probably going to be selling in the US, right? Anyone who's um selling
14:48
in other markets. Okay, cool. So, if you're if you're in a
14:53
cood market, it's fine. But if you are in in anywhere in the west which is
14:58
Europe or the US for example you will have payment processing only. So which
15:03
means that if your payment processor gets banned which is very normal that
15:07
means that your business is basically shut right and that's doomsday. I'll ask
15:12
you a question. So, let's say if there's a PayPal and or a Stripe and stuff and
15:16
those payment processors, how what percentage like out of 100%
15:20
what percentage do you think is the percentage you can piss your
15:25
customers off of 100%. In terms of like your customers complaining to your
15:29
PayPal because you get banned once you they complain complain to the processor
15:33
and the processor shuts you down. What do you think that percentage is?
15:39
So let's say if there's there's 100% of customers, what percentage of customers
15:44
are allowed to complain for you to be cool with your processor? Otherwise,
15:48
it's it's it's it's a flag. Someone else says 40%. No, it's not 40%.
15:55
4%. Okay. In Stripe, it's 75.
16:02
Okay. So that basically means that out of a 100 customers that I have, if 75%
16:07
of them complain, I am flagged. If I repeatedly get flagged, they will hold
16:12
my money, which is basically if we make a $100, they'll hold 80 bucks. They'll
16:16
give us 20 and they'll hold it for like 2 months and then release it, which is a
16:19
cash flow crunch. Worst case scenario, if you're 2%, you're banned. You're
16:23
gone. Okay? So it's 75 for Stripe, it's 1% for PayPal. So the margin for error,
16:30
guys, is very less. This is why you have to make sure that you give a good
16:35
experience. So high chargeback and PayPal freezes. So there are two ways
16:38
you can get screwed here. One is of course they ban you and the second thing
16:41
is they start holding your money, right? So let's say you do 10 grand in sales,
16:45
they'll hold six grand, give you four, but then you have to pay for your you
16:50
have to pay the supplier, you have to pay for the ads, right? So where does
16:52
that happen? So huge huge flag. The next thing is ad platform bans. Now we are
16:57
advertising through Facebook, Meta, um, Tik Tok, right? And if we get banned for
17:03
whatever reason, then again, you don't have a way to advertise, which basically
17:07
means you don't have a way to show your product to your customer and therefore
17:10
not get sales. So I remember a time when I started out and it was I think the
17:16
first time Trump got elected and during the elections there's usually a mass
17:20
wave of bans. So they they banned 16 of my ad accounts. All went down. My
17:24
business was shut for 2 months. I didn't have a solution because again I was the
17:29
only one I knew who was doing drop shipping at that time. I didn't have you
17:32
know a bunch of a room full of people doing drop shipping service. It was
17:35
pretty bad for me. But my job right now is to teach you how to game the system
17:40
because once you get banned doesn't mean you can't come back. There's always a
17:43
hack and my job is to share with you and what took me 2 months will to take you
17:48
two minutes now because I'm going to share those solutions right
17:52
now. Here is what traditional drop shipping was when I started out. So,
17:56
generic products with no differentiation, slow shipping and poor
18:00
tracking experience, manual ad creation, commodity pricing. So, it was like,
18:04
okay, let's price our product the lowest and we're going to win the war. Right
18:08
now, it's here's where we want to be, which is AI powered micro branded drop
18:13
shipping, which is essentially branded products with unique custom designs,
18:17
fast fulfillment. AI does all the heavy lifting, be it the ads, the product
18:22
images or the optimized website. And then we want to focus on brand
18:27
storytelling and premium market positioning and not just a price war.
18:33
Now, here's what a website looked like when I started. Uh, as you know, pretty
18:38
clunky. No branding, no color palette, uh cheap products, slow shipping, race
18:44
to the bottom when it comes to pricing, um and poor customer experience. Here's
18:49
what we are supposed to look like, which is uh validated product, AI powered and
18:53
micro branded, premium positioning, custom design, and enhanced customer
18:59
experience. Now, branding takes time, but that's the
19:04
edge. Okay? Um you want to start simple, guys. I I I
19:09
don't want you to have this perfection analysis or analysis paralysis. I've
19:14
seen guys who spend a week trying to create a logo because it should look
19:16
like the best. We don't want that, right? You want to begin basic and
19:21
improve and iterate as we go forward. So, I don't want you to waste too much
19:26
time here. The next thing is you validate first. So, we use lowrisk drop
19:31
shipping, which basically means we test more products to find our winner. I want
19:35
to tell you this, one product can change your life. It did for me. Okay? You
19:39
don't u the way it works is it's you test multiple products. Most of them are
19:44
going to fail, but if you hit one, right? Then you make 10x 50x the money
19:49
that you failed on the 10, right? So you don't have to get a 100 products right.
19:53
You don't have to get 50. You just have to get one. So when you tell yourself
19:56
that, uh it makes your life a lot easier when you're testing. So investing
20:00
strategically right now let's be honest whenever you
20:05
start out your currency is not the dollars you have it's your time so you
20:10
have a lot of time you are a billionaire in when it comes to time so invest that
20:14
strategically right the 8020 rule which is the perero principle the 20% you
20:19
invest will eventually get the 80% of returns you need to realize what are the
20:23
20% uh which will get you to the returns and I'm going to talk about that and
20:27
then lastly we're going to be leveraging AI acceleration. So, we're going to be
20:31
using AI at every step to make your job a lot easier. And I'm going to walk you
20:34
through all the tools that you guys will need for that.
20:38
Now, the competitive advantage of patience. 85% of drop shippers quit. I
20:44
think this is number is actually a bit higher. It's more like 90%. Um, they
20:48
quit because within the first 6 months, they don't have the right systems, the
20:53
right processes, and therefore it's random. Let me try and win the lottery.
20:57
And I don't. and I quit. Right? The next thing is you get three times more the
21:02
result if you go micro branded and premium. Let me ask you guys this. If
21:06
you had to define a brand in a single line, what would it be? What is a brand
21:10
for you? Anyone?
21:15
Yeah. Okay. Legacy.
21:20
But let's say if you were talking about like legacy, I understand it's it's the
21:22
right answer. But let's say legacy brands have built over tens of years,
21:25
right? But let's say it's something that I just started today like a year from
21:27
there. What is a good brand? Yeah.
21:35
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool.
21:47
Yeah. Builds trust. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah.
21:55
Yeah. Yeah. I I mean every they're all right answers here, but a brand when it
22:00
comes to drop shipping is or a micro brand is
22:06
basically a good customer experience. What do I mean? A customer experience is
22:11
not just your product is from the time he sees your ad, clicks on shop now,
22:15
goes to your website, how fast does your website load? Does it take 15 seconds?
22:19
Does it take 3 seconds? How long is your checkout? Is it four step or is it
22:22
oneclick checkout? Once he checks out, how many emails does he get? You know,
22:27
do you inform him about his order or do you just let him like wonder where his
22:30
order is for the next seven days or the next 10 days? What is the unboxing
22:34
experience like? And then eventually once he unboxes your product, what is
22:38
the experience of the product? Right? That overall experience and a good one
22:43
is what a brand is because essentially the it's a brand when he comes back
22:47
again. Otherwise, if he just buys from you once, uh that is essentially not a
22:50
brand, right? So 60% more customer retention if you give it a branded
22:55
experience. So even if you're managing 15% of customers coming back to your
23:01
websites and buying from you, which is basically a higher LTV,
23:05
um I'll ask you a question. If people come buy and come back to us and buy
23:10
again, how is that monetarily beneficial for us?
23:14
No additional cost. Yep, that's the right answer. So the
23:17
first time I spend money on ads, I'm spending close to 30 to 40% 25% on that
23:24
sale. But the second sale, my gross profit is my net profit because
23:29
essentially the only difference between gross and net is your advertising uh
23:32
spend right or your cost of acquisition or your cost of purchase. So essentially
23:35
when the customer comes back for the second or third time, I'm making a lot
23:38
more money which is adding to my bottom line and therefore I'm super profitable
23:42
in the end. Now, we're going to be using AI tools
23:46
for design generation, product photography, ad creative, website optim
23:50
optimization. Uh, we're going to let AI do most of the heavy lifting. There's a
23:55
lot of clutter out there in the market. Every day there's a new AI tool coming
23:58
up, but I'm going to make that job easy for you guys and give you my stack of
24:02
tools that I use. Tried and tested, works, and I'm not saying that there
24:06
might not be a tool tomorrow which comes and beats it. essentially it'll be a
24:09
good sort of um plan for you on how you can leverage AI in your e-commerce
24:14
journey. So I think the next steps are the fact
24:19
that um you know you're ready to start drop shipping in 2025 isn't about
24:24
competition on price. It's about building beloved micro brands, right?
24:29
It's about giving a good customer experience. Um AI tools accelerate every
24:33
step, right? So the next set uh the next step for us now is going to be setting
24:39
our foundations and then getting into product research, getting into um you
24:44
know how to build your website and stuff like that. So we we'll move to the next
24:47
thing which is um setting your foundations. So
24:53
this this module is going to talk more about
24:58
the person and not the business because I genuinely
25:02
feel that your business is a reflection of you. Uh most of the times that I have
25:08
felt that my business isn't working. I have to I I've had to look inward and
25:12
fix something here and then I see the result over there. Right? So building
25:15
systems disciplined and a 2.0 into identity which is essentially um yeah
25:22
building ideas. First off I'm going to start off with this reading list right
25:25
guys here are some books that I would highly recommend you all to read. It's
25:29
not ecom related but I believe um each one of them adds a certain element to uh
25:36
sort of you know upgrade you in your journey. How many of you have read any
25:39
of these? Yeah.
25:47
Okay, cool. Yeah, exactly. Okay, this guy knows. Uh,
25:52
so this book is like the bible of marketing and advertising. Um, it's
25:57
essentially a book you can't get and and the hard copy especially, right? Like
26:00
and it's I don't even know. It's like for a,000 bucks apparently this book,
26:03
maybe more. It's it's in high really um high demand and low supply, but you can
26:09
get like a PDF kind of version for this and read this. So I would highly
26:12
recommend to read all these books before you start out because the next thing we
26:17
want to do is we want to identify before strategy
26:22
which is basically to grow your business you first need to grow into a new
26:26
version of yourself. What do I mean by that? The next thing is architecting
26:31
your 2.0. So everyone right now this is you are your 1.0 version or if you think
26:36
you are your 2.0 then this is architecting your 3.0. So what I want
26:40
you guys to do after of course I go through everything over here is build
26:44
that second version of yourself which will help you elevate to a point where
26:48
you can scale to such high numbers and not just for drop shipping but this
26:51
entire um this entire program and your the next 10 years of your life basically
26:56
right so the first thing is physical excellence never missing workouts mental
27:00
clarity I'm going to get into deep work which I think is a superpower and I'm
27:03
going to tell you how I usually do it and then strategic relationships so only
27:07
spending time with people to expand your vision and challenge your thinking. And
27:10
I think everyone in this room is like that. So that's pretty cool. Um, here's
27:16
the 2.0 operating system for yourself. Okay. You treat distractions as rare
27:21
luxuries. Invest surplus cash into growth systems. And you operate in calm,
27:26
decisive mode, never frantic, always strategic. And this is going to happen
27:31
to a lot of you because the moment you start your drop shipping journey, what's
27:35
going to happen is you're going to start making some sales. For example, let's
27:37
say I'm doing $1,000 a day. I'm making $200 in profit and boom, suddenly my
27:42
payment processor is gone or there I get hit with an ad account banned. You have
27:47
to make sure that you do not get frantic in that moment and lose your [ __ ] in
27:52
some sense. And stay strategic because there's always a solution for every
27:57
problem. Like they say, if there is a problem, there's always a solution. It
28:01
works both ways, right? So now the four pillars of excellence here
28:05
I want to be focusing upon the mindset how you operate calmly make decisions
28:10
for long-term leverage not short-term emotion we have behaviors here so what
28:15
you need to do in the entire day and the environment so you know keeping your
28:18
physical space clear and energizing and again your finances which is treat
28:23
business as cash for scaling and reinvesting and not for luxury. So the
28:28
next thing I want to talk about is here's your daily excellence checklist.
28:32
Okay, I don't know how many of you can do this but morning clarity. No phone
28:37
until breakfast. Who do you think can do that here?
28:43
Okay, very few hands because in the last session I had everyone going up. No
28:46
phone until breakfast. Yeah. Okay.
28:50
Because Okay, I'll give you an example. You start your day with intention not
28:53
distraction. I'll give I'll give you an example for this. I create content. We
28:57
have close to a million followers ac across socials and I do not have
29:02
Instagram on my phone. Okay, it's deleted. How many of you have seen the
29:06
documentary Social Dilemma on Netflix? Okay, that you guys have the scene then.
29:11
So, yeah, watch that because essentially what you have to understand is if you
29:15
start your day with dopamine hits and cheap dopamine hits, then you
29:18
essentially um you already feel like you've done a lot in the beginning and
29:22
your peak hours are your morning time. So I would highly suggest that you have
29:26
that morning clarity where you don't use your phone first thing in the morning.
29:30
Um then there's of course physical training. You have continuous learning.
29:34
So you have a daily skill or wellbuilding knowledge that compounds
29:37
over time and your environment which is very important right. So you you use
29:42
visible scoreboards to track health, business and growth metrics because what
29:47
you don't track you cannot improve. Does anyone do this? Tracking health,
29:51
business and growth metrics. Yeah. So again these are all separate.
30:00
What do I mean by tracking business metrics? Like for example let's say if
30:03
I'm running my ads okay and on day one there's something which worked. So I
30:08
write that down in my ad journal per se that this worked for me and this didn't
30:13
work and I maintain that every day because let's say there's a week where I
30:17
have a spike of sales. Now two months later I want to come back
30:21
to that and understand what really worked in that week. What did I do in my
30:25
Facebook media buying that worked? So I can revisit that tracker and therefore I
30:31
can you know do the same thing. And another thing which happens here is that
30:34
I keep myself accountable right by having these uh scoreboards in place you
30:39
are basically keeping yourself accountable to level up every time.
30:44
Now here are some time management fundamentals.
30:48
First is the airplane mode protocol. I usually do this. So disconnect from all
30:53
distraction during workar blocks. Your focus is sacred. I like actionbased
30:58
goals more than outcome based goals. So for example, if my goal is to make 100k,
31:02
that is a outcome based goal. My action based goal is what do I need to do every
31:08
single day to get to 100K. Right? So I like focusing on more on action based
31:12
rather than outcome based because outcome based are mostly like we set a
31:15
goal, we forget about it and it never happens. Um and then we decide on
31:18
non-negotiables. So decide which daily actions cannot be skipped regardless of
31:23
circumstances. And I'll get to that. So workday protocol. Again, I'm giving
31:29
you these frameworks that I personally use which have helped me and a lot of
31:32
the people that I know so that you guys can implement what you can. I I would
31:35
say implement as much as possible. But routine, sleep, diets are
31:39
non-negotiable. Everything else builds around that. Hardest tasks first. Okay.
31:43
So you tackle your most challenging work during deep work sessions. I'm going to
31:47
get to the whole deep work part in a bit. And then you have sprint
31:50
structures. So how many of you have heard of the pomodoro technique?
31:56
Pom pomodoro technique. Yeah. So basically I think it's it means tomato
32:01
in Italian I believe and it's essentially working for 30 minute blocks
32:05
and having 5 minute breaks and doing the same thing again. So you work in sprints
32:10
rather than blocks correct in this technique. And then you have the quick
32:14
decision rule. Uh so over here we have the 2-minut rule and the 5-minute rule.
32:18
Let me break it down. If there's anything which takes just 2 minutes, you
32:23
do it right then. Okay? Because what happens is I have to send
32:29
this email. Okay, I'll do it tomorrow. And then boom, you forget about it. It
32:31
never happens. So if it's going to take less than 2 minutes, you do it now. You
32:35
don't do it in 5 minutes. You do it now. The next rule is the five minute rule.
32:39
If you ever procrastinate about doing anything, you're like, I don't want to
32:42
write this long essay. I don't want to do this research part. Just do it for 5
32:46
minutes. And if you don't feel like doing it after 5 minutes, you stop it.
32:49
But in 90% of the times, do it for 5 minutes and you will see that you will
32:54
overcome your procrastination and you will actually end up going through with
32:57
the entire task. So I think this is something that I use which works. Now
33:01
here's my text hack guys something that I use uh that I think you guys can
33:05
benefit from. We use Slack for communication. So we work in teams.
33:08
Slack is for communication. I use notion for centralized notes and knowledge
33:13
management and I use notion calendar. Uh I don't like using Google calendar or
33:17
anything. I think this integrates really well with uh notion and therefore it's
33:21
really easy to use. I would highly recommend you guys use notion calendar
33:24
with notion. Um the next thing is we use ClickUp for project management. So for
33:30
example, if you had a team and you had to assign a task to someone, you would
33:34
just put it on ClickUp. You would assign that person. you would set a deadline
33:37
and that's how you would use ClickUp to manage your project which is essentially
33:41
your entire drop shipping module. Um how many of you listen to music while
33:46
working? Yeah, I think basically most people,
33:49
right? And that's the worst thing you can do because um while you listen to
33:55
music, you're basically giving your like 50% of your brain is getting the
33:59
dopamine hit by listening to some tech deep house rap music. And then the other
34:04
50% is trying to focus, which is the worst thing you can do. That's the
34:08
opposite of deep work. It's called shallow work, which is essentially you
34:11
think you're working, but but you're really not. You're skipping tabs, uh you
34:14
listen to music. So, I use this tool called Brain.fm. FM, which is
34:18
scientifically designed focused music. It's just like frequency music which
34:21
gets you zoned in and you feel like you're in a flow state. You ever been in
34:25
that flow state where you just forget that the world exists and you're so
34:28
focused working that everything is just fluid? U this helps you get there. So
34:33
stop listening to such music. I mean again if you're doing like admin work
34:37
like replying to emails or doing some really low-level work show music works
34:41
but if it's anything to do with focus you shouldn't be listening to music.
34:44
Okay. Then of course chat GBD Pro for any research writing and strategy.
34:50
Now here are some hyper productivity hacks that I follow. The first thing is
34:55
the digital discipline. So no social media doing work hours. Pretty obvious.
34:59
I use brain.fm for focus. No distracting music. I also do another thing which is
35:05
I badge process similar tasks together. So if I'm replying to emails, I'm only
35:10
replying to emails. I'm not replying to one email then doing product research
35:14
then building an ad then also checking my Instagram. So I batch
35:18
tasks together which are similar right? So if I'm doing product research that's
35:22
all I'm doing like that's the only tab which is open on my browser. All of you
35:26
who have a billion tabs open on the browser that is literally a productivity
35:29
killer because that is shallow work right. Um and the last thing is of
35:33
course avoiding cheap dopamine that kills focus. I think I've again guys I'm
35:37
hemorrhaging this point. There's nothing about drop shipping here but trust me
35:41
this is what will make it or break it when it comes to you guys hitting your
35:44
goal not just for drop shipping but for every module every capstone after uh
35:49
Dubai also the next thing is the biological optimization
35:52
everyone gets how many hours of sleep do you get every day
35:57
six okay okay
36:04
two someone said two you had two hours of sleep okay that's that
36:08
Yeah, that's that's that's not very good. So,
36:11
I would I would say you guys need to get at least I think the the last bad slept
36:16
well. Yeah, they're all like eight hours, but
36:18
okay. 7 hours of sleep consistently. You eat clean, stay hydrated. How many of
36:23
you meditate over here? Okay. Um and when I say meditate, I mean
36:30
like every day and frequently. Cool. So, for the those Okay. How many
36:36
of you like I have struggled with meditation I'll be honest uh and to be
36:40
regular every day and what I want to share about meditation is
36:45
the fact that I know there are a lot of like these fancy apps like headsp space
36:49
and calm but what's really worked for me and these are for the people who
36:52
struggle meditating but want to feel like what's worked for me is when you
36:57
have those apps on and then there's someone speaking to you and telling you
37:00
to do like 10 different things and breathe slow and fast and then there's
37:03
this music playing like I feel like that didn't work for me I keep it really
37:07
simple. I meditate for 10 minutes daily. I just put up time on my iPhone, put on
37:11
the side and shut my eyes and then I just wander. Right? I think this is the
37:16
one which I have been able to do uh more like like periodically rather than
37:21
something which I do for a couple of days and then I forget about it. So for
37:23
the those those of you who struggle meditation with meditation I would
37:27
highly advise you to do that because the way I use meditation as a superpower is
37:32
basically I do it midday and essentially uh when you get really overwhelmed with
37:37
work which I think you guys will also get overwhelmed with your assignments
37:40
you have multiple projects it centers you and then it helps you kind of manage
37:44
stuff in your own head in those 10 minutes okay because those 10 minutes
37:47
don't feel like 10 minutes they feel more like an hour at least for me. Um,
37:50
so doing this, keeping it simple, no apps, no funky music, just putting it on
37:55
the side, um, low lighting, and that's what I do. And then only consuming
38:00
content that develops you. I think this is super important.
38:03
I have two YouTubes, okay? One YouTube has junk, one YouTube has 10 channels
38:08
only that I'm subscribed to, which is um, again channels which make me uplevel
38:14
myself in some way because the content you consume shapes you. Okay. Um, so I
38:21
had a rule for myself in the beginning where I could only watch CEO interviews
38:26
and I could only watch self-development videos. There was no Netflix. There was
38:29
no none of that um stuff, right? So this also helps. Now
38:34
this part guys, I think I'm really really excited to share with you because
38:38
I genuinely feel like deep work is your superpower. So what is deep work for
38:44
you? Like what do you think deep work is?
38:48
Yeah. Okay.
38:54
Yeah. Anyone else? Okay. Cool. So,
39:00
deep work is essentially being in a flow state which I just said where you forget
39:05
everything. You focus on a few things only and you get [ __ ] done. This is
39:09
where the transformation happens. Um, and I want to talk about the do. So,
39:14
this is the framework that I use for dreamwork, right? So I block the sacred
39:19
time. So I block my calendar in two blocks for two hours. So it's called D
39:23
verb block one two two hours. D verb block two two hours in this. So I would
39:28
say try and get two hours done a day. But um in the most uh efficient way I
39:35
would say 4 hours is is where you want to be aiming towards right you have
39:38
clear outcomes before the session starts. So it's not like you start your
39:42
dream work you go D and D and then you think what should I do? You should have
39:45
your three big tasks with specific measurable results decided before you
39:51
start your deepwork session. Okay, so that's super important. The digital
39:55
isolation is putting your phone away on airplane airplane only essential tabs
39:59
open. You have a sprint structure like I said. So like work in 15 minute sprints
40:03
or 30 minute sprints. You track your results. So what I do is I score every
40:07
deep work session out of 10 because a lot of the times I am doing deep work
40:11
but let's say I get a call or I'm distracted then that deep work session
40:14
is not a 10 on 10 it is a five on 10 and I literally track that because I spoke
40:18
about having dashboards which track your performance this is how you do it and
40:22
then single focus which is one task one outcome and complete immersion
40:29
so we spoke about the dos let's speak about the don'ts uh no communication
40:34
apps WhatsApp Instagram or email are forbidden during workboard sessions. No
40:39
random interruptions so you don't answer unexpected calls. No multitasking. This
40:44
is the worst. If you're context switching then you're destroying deep
40:47
work which is like you're switching between 15 tabs. Worst thing ever. One
40:50
task complete focus. No mindless browsing on YouTube or social media and
40:54
no chaotic environment which is cluttery or noisy spaces. Sabotage concentration
41:00
and creativity. So um here's the environment you want. Again, clean and
41:05
organized, natural light, comfortable temperature, everything already set up.
41:09
Uh because remember, your environment is an extension of your mindset. So, you
41:13
have to make it worth your ambition, right?
41:19
So, let's talk about scaling mindset
41:22
fundamentals. What do I mean by that? Like, once you start getting some sales,
41:26
how do you go from $100 a day to $1,000 a day or to $5,000
41:31
a day, right? So you always want to back stuff based on data.
41:37
After you've tested like hundreds of products, spent millions of dollars on
41:41
ads, you develop this marketing gut, which basically means like I can say
41:44
like, okay, I think this product is going to work because I've just tested
41:47
so much. I have an idea. But in the beginning, you don't. So till the time
41:51
you don't actually build that marketing gut, I would say base everything on
41:55
data. Read the numbers. If you feel like it's going to work is probably the worst
41:58
thing that you could do to yourself. Um the next thing is the PAE formula which
42:03
is pattern recognition, analysis and execution. Okay, what does that mean? In
42:07
most problems, you would have a pattern. You would have to analyze that pattern
42:13
and then execute the solution. The next thing is the testing mindset. Marketing
42:17
is just a fancy word for testing new things. So I'm saying testing products,
42:22
testing creatives, testing pricing, everything, right? And the last one that
42:25
I use pretty well is the process of elimination. Because what you have to
42:29
understand that the two pillars of drop shipping is basically your ads and your
42:33
funnel which is your website. So it can only go wrong in these two things. What
42:37
I like doing is because there's going to be a time where you think you've tested
42:40
the right product, made the right creatives, your website is good but
42:43
you're not getting any sales and you're going to ask yourself like what am I
42:47
doing wrong? This is where the process of elimination comes in because you read
42:52
the data. Let's say if your cost per click is less than a dollar, your CTR is
42:56
above 2%, and your CPM is below $20. So, it's not your ad. So, I eliminate the
43:01
ads. So, what am I left with exactly? So, then I know, okay, my funnel has an
43:05
issue. Maybe the load time is not good. Maybe my pricing is not correct. Maybe
43:09
if I price my product lower, my conversion rate goes off. So, that's
43:12
where this is pretty uh helpful. Another thing I want you guys to do is reframe
43:18
the word failure. Uh never treat it as failure. they're just data points. Uh I
43:23
think the biggest mistake people make is once they fail, let's say if you test a
43:27
product and you fail, you have no learnings from it. Um you just move on
43:31
to the next one, right? You're like, "Okay, this didn't work. Next one." But
43:34
you spent money on ads, you got data, and if you don't have any learning, then
43:38
essentially you are not making any progress. And
43:44
like they say um you know the we all know this guy and insanity is
43:51
doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. That's
43:55
what Einstein said and that's what most people do which is they keep doing the
43:59
same thing and they expect a different result but that is basically insanity
44:02
and that happens a lot. People just don't zoom out. So you don't repeat the
44:06
same mistake and the only way you will not repeat the same mistake is when you
44:10
have learned from the failure not just skipped it. Correct? So you learn once
44:14
apply forever. The last one you learn once apply
44:17
forever. Each failure contains seeds of success and like I said you recognize
44:21
the patterns of what worked, what didn't and you work on it.
44:26
Now patience is key. I really want to stress on patience because I'll be
44:31
honest, it took me uh again I didn't have the right mentorship or the
44:35
guidance, but it took me 30 products, 30 failed tests to get to my winner
44:39
eventually. Now, I'm not saying it's going to take you 30 failed product
44:42
tests, but what I'm saying is that you only have to find one winning product
44:47
which changes your life. Basically, it did for me. So, therefore, you have to
44:51
be patient and not get frantic when things don't work for you. You have to
44:56
research. So you have to have a deep understanding of your market, customers
45:00
and competition. That's how you get some more confidence even if you fail. And
45:04
the next thing is of course be creative with your approaches and differentiate
45:08
from your competitors. Um here's the advantage of being data driven. Okay,
45:13
you have 10 times more the uh 10 times faster decisions. you have three times
45:18
higher success success rate and a 50% reduced risk in terms of um making any
45:25
mistakes or getting into any situation where your business is at risk. Right?
45:29
So here's how you build your learning system. You have a pre-esting plan. So
45:32
you already have a plan before you start testing through research. During
45:36
execution, you're tracking key metrics and documenting your observations. You
45:40
have a post- test analysis which is like if it failed, what didn't work? And only
45:44
then do I move on to the next one. And then you have knowledge integration
45:48
which is apply learnings to refine your overall strategy and approach.
45:52
And here's the compound effect of having systems and operations. So when you have
45:56
a system and you do things the right way, you're not going to see a lot. This
45:59
is what a random drop shipper is. And this is someone who has a system and the
46:04
compounding effect doesn't kick in over here in month one. So you're not going
46:07
to feel too much of a difference. But from month two month three you see this
46:10
exponential curve which comes in if you have the right systems in place which of
46:14
course I will share with you all but you have to still follow it. Now again this
46:19
was the identity transformation. You focus, you uh grow with continuous
46:24
learning. Your systems uh have process optimization. Your data is evidence bas
46:31
evidence and evidence-based actions. My bad. And discipline is consistent daily
46:35
actions. And yeah, that's the module 2 recap
46:38
guys. Your what I want you all to do today is building
46:43
is is get busy in building your 2.0 identity. Uh you know, so just write
46:47
that 2.0 version of yourself in a paper. How does that guy look like? How does he
46:51
think? How does he talk? Everything it has to be scripted down to the tea. Uh
46:55
you can use AI for this of course again just to kind of like help you fragment
46:58
your thoughts uh into one place. Then you have mastering time and routine. So
47:04
establish your non-negotiables which combine into excellence and deploy your
47:08
system and tools which I will be sharing with you but at least you have an idea
47:11
to think like that and yeah you embrace datadriven learning which is treating
47:16
failures as data points and not defeats. Um so yeah guys the foundation is set uh
47:22
with this identity shift your scaling will become inevitable. Uh I'm excited
47:27
to see what your 2.0 looks like and yeah that's it for today. Thank you.
47:41
Folks, if you have questions now, just stand up and have
47:57
Yeah. Yeah. You'll have to wait for the class to end
48:07
though because we have a photo shoot. So, try not to leave the classroom
48:11
though. Okay. We'll be going downstairs to the Amity Footsteps. There's a group
48:17
photo that needs to be taken. So, please don't exit the classrooms. You will miss
48:21
out on that. Yeah.

Foundations & Product Research
09/09/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Mr. Ishan Suri
0:01
Okay, good afternoon guys. How's everyone doing?
0:06
Awesome. So, we have the big screen today. Um, pretty cool. And I think I
0:11
got a lot of questions yesterday on how to find the right product and we're
0:14
going to be breaking it everything down. Um, so I'm pretty excited to share with
0:18
you guys. So, yeah, let's let's kind of begin with the first one. I think I want
0:21
to start off with what to avoid, uh, you know, in the in the beginning, which is
0:26
more important than what to choose. So the first thing is something which goes
0:31
against Facebook ad policies. So how many of you have read the Facebook ad
0:35
policies? Okay. So whoever hasn't Google it um
0:42
and go through the policies. For example, if you're running a beauty
0:45
product, you cannot show too much skin in your ad. And if you do, you get
0:49
banned. So that's something which is part of the policies. There's multiple
0:53
other things um which you need to know before you advertise your product
0:56
because um there's a good chance that you don't even know that this is
0:59
something which can be flagged and once you get banned like I told you guys
1:02
yesterday that's a huge issue and then you have to really get into some stuff
1:06
which you don't want to in terms of like gaming the system and all of that.
1:08
That's a backup plan. We don't want to lead with you know pissing Facebook off
1:12
and getting banned. The next thing is we don't want to be going into small
1:17
subniches. So, TAM is total addressable market which is essentially the amount
1:23
of people you can address in a market. So, I I like going for broad niches like
1:26
personal care, beauty, um you know, apparel, kids, home. Um subniches is
1:33
something you should avoid in the beginning because I want to keep things
1:35
broad when I start out and that makes my life easier if I'm testing products
1:39
because I can test multiple products in niches. The next thing is I think not
1:43
sure if this if it was this patch but a lot of people asked me about high ticket
1:46
products. I do not recommend high ticket products in the beginning. So, anything
1:49
above $150 in terms of AOV is something I wouldn't um recommend in the beginning
1:56
because once you're selling something this expensive or in that ticket size,
2:01
everyone expects your customer expects flawless quality uh branding which you
2:06
probably won't get in. Okay, can you use this? Okay, cool. So, yeah, something
2:10
that you're not going to get in the beginning. Um so
2:16
the next thing is commoditized products. Again simple stuff. Uh you don't want to
2:19
be selling um something which is uh very basic. This is pretty um yeah common
2:26
knowledge but I just thought I'd put it there. Um the next thing is trademark
2:29
and copyright. I had a few people asking me if they could sell um so don't sell
2:33
any you know fake Jordans and stuff like that. I'm just putting it out there. I'm
2:37
sure most of you won't. Um, and the last thing is low margins and unit economics.
2:42
I'm going to be running through what a low margin product looks like, but
2:46
anything. So, if you source something for 10 bucks, you have to sell it at 3x
2:50
the price, which is essentially $30. That is the rule of thumb at least. Um,
2:54
2.75 to 3x. Now, this includes your shipping. So, it's your cost of goods
2:58
sold. And the last thing, of course, is
3:03
compliance and safety concerns. I had someone asking me about um selling
3:08
matcha I believe and my advice to that person was I would avoid it because
3:12
anything which is ingestable or is put on the skin if something goes wrong with
3:16
the end customer then you can get into trouble so I would avoid it because if
3:21
you're sourcing matcha from China for example and you cannot validate the
3:25
actual um you know you you so basically how it works is you have to send it to a
3:29
lab get it tested get that report and make sure that every ingredient in that
3:34
Matcha is for example healthy for the customer and that is expensive in the
3:38
beginning. So if you don't get that done it's going to be bad for you. So avoid
3:42
those products. Yeah. Thank you.
3:48
Cool. So here's what I've built for you guys. Okay. I was talking about high
3:52
margins. Now I'm going to go through each of these. Um you're going to get
3:56
access to the sheet and the way it's going to work is any of these things you
3:59
fill in is going to change the numbers accordingly. So, let me start from the
4:02
one on the left, which is the selling price. For example, I'm selling my
4:05
product at $46.90. I'm sourcing it for $16.99. Uh, I have a packaging cost. I
4:11
have a 3PL, which is basically if you work with one, so I put it as zero. And
4:15
then you have your shipping. And then you have your gateway fee of 4%, which
4:18
is essentially PayPal. Most payment gateways will charge you 4% of your
4:23
selling price. So, that's your COGS cost to goods sold, which is 36%. That's your
4:29
gross margin. As a rule of thumb, you want your gross margin percentage to be
4:34
at least 60%. So, write that down. Anything below that, that's what I meant
4:38
by low margins. Anything below a 60% gross margin is not a good margin.
4:43
Right? So, the markup there is 2.7x. So, I sourced it for 17 bucks. I'm selling
4:47
it for 46.90. 2.75 is the bare minimum I want to go in terms of the actual
4:53
markup. The next thing I have is my customer acquisition cost. So, $20 is
4:58
what I'm going to be paying Facebook to acquire that customer. ME is just a
5:02
fancy term for what is my marketing cost in terms of percentage and return on ad
5:06
spend. Um, you guys heard of that? Yeah. Cool. So, if you spend a dollar and you
5:11
get 2.3 bad, then your rorowass or ROAS is 2.3. Now, what you can do here even
5:17
before selling a single unit is add all these details. So, for example, you put
5:22
your product cost, you put your selling price, you and then that tells you that
5:26
if I'm sourcing something for $17, selling at 47, then I can only spend 20
5:32
bucks on Facebook to get a net profit of 20%. Okay? So, you know these numbers
5:36
even before you've actually sold a single piece. And this is super
5:39
important because this tells me that if I start spending more than $20 per sale
5:44
on Facebook, which you which is what you'll be able to see, then my net
5:48
profit goes down. Uh as a rule of thumb, I want to be operating at least above a
5:53
15% net profit. Uh otherwise it gets really hard to scale with those numbers.
5:57
So you can put any of these uh this is the sheet by the way.
6:01
So I mean I think it's going to take time to load but like I've attached the
6:04
sheet over here. Once you download this you will be able to kind of duplicate
6:07
this sheet and use it as you will. So this is how it looks. uh you can put all
6:12
the data just make a copy of this file and you'll be able to basically edit the
6:15
data and know exactly what your numbers should look like even before send
6:19
selling a single piece which is knowing your numbers right now here are the four
6:23
factors of winning products good unit economics so everything I just showed
6:26
you is good unit economics good margins healthy margins reinvigorate I'll get to
6:30
that your total addressable market should be big so you're addressing a
6:34
bigger market makes it easier for you to sell and the next thing is your product
6:38
index KPI which I'm also going to get to what is that um you know I told you guys
6:42
yesterday that I'm going to be sharing a framework.
6:44
So for example, if you ask yourself should I test this product or not?
6:47
That's the basic question right? This framework will help you decide either
6:51
you disqualify or qualify this product uh to test. So um yeah first thing know
6:58
your numbers. That sheet I just shared with you guys is basically knowing
7:01
knowing your numbers. Aim for a greater than 60% profit margin and don't expect
7:07
success with FB ads under $50 cost per acquisition. So you could be spending up
7:11
to 50 bucks on Facebook depending on um you know what your selling price is.
7:18
So what does healthy margin mean? It's sales price minus cost of product minus
7:23
freight minus cor which is basically your shipping minus the taxes you pay
7:27
depending on which country you're in minus your cost per acquisition which is
7:31
what you spend on Facebook to acquire that customer equal to profit. Okay? So
7:38
you need to know all these numbers literally by heart and put it on that
7:41
sheet because if you don't um then you will never know what your absolute
7:45
profit is and in the end of the day business is about making money
7:49
especially drop shipping. So profit is all that matters. Sales is only a vanity
7:53
figure if you're losing money. Now what did I mean by reinvigorate? Um
7:57
horizontal expansion is difficult. So for example if I want to sell this
8:00
remote right? If I want to add two more buttons to this and change the color,
8:05
it's going to be super expensive for me because the supplier is going to ask me
8:07
like, "Okay, cool. I'll do this for you, but I want a MOQ or a minimum order
8:12
quantity of 2,000 pieces." Now, we don't want to do that because again, it's
8:15
going to cost us money. So, what is better for me to do is to create a
8:20
product flywheel. What does that mean? If I'm selling this remote, then I want
8:24
products like this remote on my website. So, if you ever go to a uh to a grocery
8:29
store before you check out or when you're making your billing, you'll see
8:33
like this rack with chewing gums and all that stuff kept because they know that
8:36
if you're stepping out, you might as well pick that up. So, you want similar
8:39
products like this one on your website. So, when they come and buy this, they
8:44
also check that stuff out and therefore they buy more for you uh from you,
8:48
right? And how does how do you think that how does that help? How does that
8:50
help the business if they buy more from us like in terms of unit economics?
8:56
anyone. Exactly. So, we've already spent on the
9:05
customer, right? So, we spent $20 on the customer. Now, we decide does he check
9:09
out with 40 bucks or does he check out with $100 and that all depends on does
9:13
he buy more from us. So, creating that product flywheel is super important on
9:17
having similar products. Now, um the best products brand uh brands can
9:22
re-engage their audience. So if you have the product five wheel that you then
9:26
they buy more from you. Okay. Now what did I mean by total addressable market?
9:31
Um this is pretty simple. What I want you to do in whatever niche you're in,
9:34
you want to go on Google trends again, select this filter filter as the country
9:38
you are selling in. Then the date filter should be past 5 years. And essentially
9:43
I don't know if you guys can see but the top of the graph is 100 and then we have
9:47
75. Now this is not a good graph because you can see it's declining. Um, and it's
9:54
near that 50 range. So, whichever niche I'm in or product I'm in, I want it to
9:57
be in that 75 and above, which tells me that that this stuff has been working
10:02
for the last 5 years and it's trending, so it's evergreen, so it's going to
10:05
work, right? So, this is how you find that out. Now, the differentiation is
10:10
having a USB. Uh, and I'll explain what USP means in terms of how you can have a
10:14
USB, right? Now, the types of differentiation, guys, it's not always
10:19
about making a different product. Differentiation can happen in multiple
10:22
ways. So how you have price you can price it different the design the
10:25
service the function the acquisition method for example your competitor is
10:31
selling this remote um through Facebook ads but you choose Tik Tok organic to
10:35
sell this now that's differentiation on acquisition method and you could
10:39
probably out compete them because you're not spending on ads and you're spending
10:42
on organics so USPS and differentiation doesn't only come by the design or color
10:48
of your product you could go for price you could go for service function
10:51
services just the way you treat your customers in the beginning, right? Like
10:54
what is your support like, what's your function and then of course your
10:57
acquisition method. So differentiation can come in multiple ways
11:02
and it can also come with regional uniqueness. So let me explain the trends
11:06
to you. When something goes viral in the US, it takes about 6 months for it to
11:11
come that trend to come to Europe. Okay. So what if I just spot something in the
11:15
US? I know a lot of people who are heavy hitters in like just the Dutch market or
11:20
just the German market and all they do is they see trends in the US and let's
11:24
say if it's a Dutch store, they would translate the store in Dutch, run Dutch
11:29
ads and print. The only reason for that is because they choose they chose the
11:32
right region to sell the product. If they would have sold the same product in
11:36
the US, it's probably already saturated. A lot of people are selling it and they
11:40
don't get that differentiation. So, it's always not actually about the product.
11:43
You guys keep asking me like is this the right product? It could also be the
11:46
location on where you're selling it. So even regional uniqueness is something I
11:50
would highly suggest that if any of you have
11:54
um you know some experience in let's say a market that others don't because
11:57
everyone's going to go for the US mainly right and US is the toughest market in
12:01
the world and also the most rewarding but if I can get my differentiation from
12:05
just being in a different region um that that's me playing smart right um so you
12:09
guys can do that. Now I spoke about a filter yesterday guys, a framework that
12:15
you will follow. And here's what it is. Okay, so it's 14 KPI points that your
12:21
product should match. Now not all 14, but it should match at least seven out
12:26
of 15 of these points. So let's go one by one by them uh through them. Okay,
12:30
small in size. Why do you think that's going to matter?
12:33
Okay, cool. Shipping easier to ship. High margin. We understand that many
12:37
users want generally more than one. That increases our average order value. So
12:42
that's that's good. Easy idea for upsells. Again, increase AOV proof of
12:47
concept for past winners of similar idea. What do I mean by that? If there
12:50
was a back massager which worked before, that means that the proof of concept was
12:55
that there's a massager which relieves back pain. Now today, if there is a
12:59
newer design of that back massager, I would sell that because I have the proof
13:03
of concept that this product works, right? So therefore any product with the
13:08
which has a past proof of concept I would just try and find something which
13:12
is a newer design and that also works. Again improves confidence improves
13:17
convenience. I think the next point about solving a problem is super super
13:21
important. I think out of the 15 over here or 14 this is one of the most
13:25
important. I don't want to sell a want in the beginning. I want to sell
13:30
a need. Right? So let's talk about the pain relief uh niche. If I'm selling a
13:34
product which literally relieves someone from pain, that's not a want, that's a
13:39
need, right? And the impulse buying there is super super high because I'm
13:43
literally taking that guy's pain away and therefore he's not going to think
13:46
twice before buying my product if my ads are good, my website is good, my pricing
13:49
is good. The next thing is saves people money. Extremely unique, pretty simple.
13:55
Improves quality of life, high perceived value. There are a lot of products which
13:59
are cheap to source but they are but they look expensive you know for the end
14:05
customer. So when he looks at your product and and he's probably expecting
14:09
a big price tag but then he comes to your website and sees something which is
14:12
relatively cheaper it's high perceived value and therefore it's an impulse buy.
14:16
The last one this is not my thought this is data. If you want to be in a woman
14:21
dominated market which is basically a woman being your end customer the
14:25
conversion rates are a lot higher. That's just how it works. You know what
14:28
I mean? Like um I'm talking beauty, I'm talking kids. If your end buyer is a
14:32
woman, the conversion rates on that are usually higher. That's why beauty as a
14:36
niche is so good. Cosmetics. Um I'm not saying you can't sell to men, but I'm
14:40
just saying like this is also a point that I'd usually do consider. Now, what
14:43
you tell yourself is let's say you have five products and you're like, which
14:46
ones should I run? You want to put them through this entire filter and if it
14:50
meets seven out of 14, it passes the test and therefore you can test it. If
14:55
it meets more that means you have more data and you have you have more
14:59
confidence that this is going to work right? So if it meets like 11 out of 14
15:02
points then you really know the chances of this being a success is higher. So
15:07
now we're not leaving anything to guesses or asking oursel like oh is this
15:11
going to work or not. We know exactly what to look for and if it matches the
15:15
points then it qualifies for a test. If it does not match seven, then you
15:20
disqualify that product no matter what you think because you need to understand
15:24
that your view on a product is very biased based on your life experiences
15:28
and what you think works. But the market does not work like that. I mean, the
15:34
amount of times that I've personally thought of a product being a [ __ ]
15:38
product and it won't work and that's made me a [ __ ] ton of money is is is too
15:41
many times. So, you never know what's going to work and this helps you kind of
15:45
like put everything together. Does it make sense? Cool.
15:50
Any questions on this? Oh, okay. Now, the first thing is we're
15:56
going to be doing product surfing. Where do we actually find these products? So,
15:59
we're going to be going through all these uh platforms and tools. I'm going
16:03
to go one by one. So, what we're going to do is we're going to go product
16:06
surfing. We're going to go on Meta, Amazon, Google, Tik Tok essentially, and
16:09
look for products. Then, we're going to throw them into our funnel, which is the
16:13
product next KPI funnel. If it me matches seven out of 14 points then we
16:19
put them down in this product arsenal sheet which is something like this. You
16:22
guys can again get access to this uh once you get the PBDs. Um, but what I've
16:27
done here is like I've written the product name, the status if it's been
16:30
tested or not, the ad status, which is essentially have I made the ads, any
16:34
comments, Facebook ad URL of my competitor, a second ad URL, my
16:39
competitor website, the Amazon URL of the product, and then lastly, the AE or
16:44
AliExpress URL because that's what I'm going to give my supplier to source, and
16:48
any upsell ideas, right? So, it's like I don't want to sell the burger. I want to
16:52
sell the burger, the fries, and the coke because it's a meal. So, I want to make
16:56
sure that I have upsell ideas ready from the beginning. And if I do, then it
17:01
increases my chances of making more money with this product. So, here's the
17:05
sheet again. Um, again, you can download it. I'm going to skip past this. So,
17:09
once we have it down on our product arsenal sheet, then we go one by one and
17:14
we start testing. Okay. Now, here are some of the tools we're
17:18
going to be using to find winning products. Um, we have I'm going to go
17:23
through each one one by one. So, um, here's the first one. It's this tool
17:27
called Trend Rocket. As you can see, I'm on the product tab
17:31
and it basically gives me a [ __ ] ton of viral products which are working right
17:35
now and gives me a lot of data which I'm going to get to. So, for example, let's
17:38
take this neck and face sculptor. It matches a lot of my KPI points that I
17:44
just mentioned, right? So, it passes my test. It gives me information like what
17:48
is the selling price of the product? What is the product cost? Uh and look at
17:52
the margin over there like he's essentially that that's a huge margin.
17:56
Correct. It also gives me three suppliers for this product this tool.
18:00
And it also gives me data like what is the revenue score, what is the trust
18:05
pilot reviews for the product, what is the scaling score. So how hard is this
18:09
product being scaled? And it gives me Facebook likes, Instagram followers and
18:12
website traffic. how many people are actually going to the website and tell
18:16
you why that is important because here if I want to know how much money is this
18:21
guy making a month and this is for any website then all I do is I go on average
18:26
monthly orders which you can see here 3942 orders and the average product
18:30
price is $35 so I basically multiply both of them so he's making 140 grand
18:35
roughly a month in sales which is this one product that I just showed you and
18:40
you can find this out for any product now this of course tells you what's the
18:44
demand and what is the scale of the product product that you're looking for.
18:49
There's another tab over here which is the trending brands. You can see all the
18:52
trending brands uh right now in the e-commerce space which will give you an
18:56
idea of what really works. Um they're close to 36,000 brands guys that you can
19:01
search for. So again it's it's again you don't have to go through all but it you
19:04
can put all these filters uh like who has a high scaling score, who has a high
19:08
revenue score in the last 30 days and get some ideas on what to use. Um, it
19:12
also tells me this important stuff like what are the top countries? For example,
19:16
Australia is number one, then you have UK, then you have US, Canada, and then
19:19
France. It also gives me gender distribution. So, 73.6% of buyers are
19:25
female. Okay. It also gives me a age distribution, which is 25 to 34 were the
19:30
main buyers. And then it gives me traffic channels. So, where is the
19:33
traffic coming from? We have social, paid, search, organic, direct. Where do
19:38
you think we're going to be using this data?
19:42
Yeah, exactly. So, we know exactly who to target in the beginning just by
19:45
looking at this and that gives us a more informed choice when we start running
19:49
our ads. Uh, and we could spy on any competitor basically using this tool.
19:55
Then I think you also have this ad section. So, all the viral ads is is
20:00
something you can see over here. Um, and then creative center. This is another
20:04
like cool feature they have like whatever ads you like you can just
20:07
basically make a mood board out of it and then um you know just use this when
20:12
you're doing your product research. Now here comes a pretty important point
20:16
which is how do you validate what to sell? Now the biggest indicator for
20:21
validation is Tik Tok and I'm looking for two things here. Okay. So let's say
20:26
I go on Tik Tok I search for the product. This is what I see. Now if
20:30
there's any product which was launched more than three to six months back I
20:34
usually don't want to touch it because that means that it has been in the
20:39
market for a while people have been selling it and therefore the chances of
20:42
saturation are super high. Ideally I want to be looking for a product which
20:46
was launched in the last 60 to 30 days. How do I find that? So when whenever you
20:50
search for the product you're going to see the dates over there right? You're
20:53
going to see the dates on when the Tik Toks were made. And obviously the
20:57
furthest date you find is when the product was launched. Another way to do
21:00
this is go on Amazon and go on the listing. And then you can scroll down
21:04
and see the listing active date, which basically means that it was launched on
21:07
a certain date. The next thing I look for is views. 6.5 million, 1 million,
21:12
2.3. This is clearly going viral on Tik Tok. So I look at two filters. The
21:17
recency, which basically means when was it launched. Okay? So if it was launched
21:22
in 2024 or 2023, I'm not touching that product because um at least in the US,
21:26
okay, like I said, if you choose a different region, it's probably not
21:29
trending there. So therefore, I can I can go there. But if I'm in the US, I'm
21:33
not touching anything which is more than 6 months. And if I have high views, so
21:37
if I'm seeing views in the millions or even in 500k plus, I know this product
21:41
has potential to go viral on Tik Tok. So I can make it organic content and I
21:44
could probably just use this content as an ad and that might fly. Because you
21:48
need to understand, it's the same algo. If it's doing well organically, it will
21:51
do well during your ads. The next thing is, of course, Tik Tok hashtag research.
21:56
Again, what we're doing right now, guys, is going and finding different ways to
21:59
find products. There are multiple ways. You should probably do all u product
22:03
research is like finding a gem in a treasure hunt, and it takes time. It's
22:06
boring, but that's where the money is. Uh, and you you want to be knowing all
22:10
the tools you have at your disposal to do it. So, I go on Tik Tok. I search
22:14
like hashtag fashion hashtag fashion design and I find Tik Toks on this and
22:19
you have to I'm not say every Tik Tok is going to have a product in it but the
22:22
chances of you finding a viral product is through hashtag research. This is
22:26
also something that I use to find winning products. Now uncovering
22:30
million-dollar products the strategy is to find innovative products with uh a
22:35
gap right which is untapped. Maybe a product is working in the US it's
22:40
untapped in Germany. So that's the gap that I find. Um the next thing is
22:45
discovering and tailoring products which is tools like trend rocket can help us
22:50
see trends data and graphs on what's really working right. This is something
22:56
that you start doing not in the short term but in the long term which is
22:59
basically taking customer feedback on how a product is working. Um and then
23:04
we're talking about navigating product development. So once you know that the
23:08
product works how do you go into a micro brand? Right? I know people who for
23:11
example were just selling this remote and every drop shipper has a black
23:15
remote. All he's done is just changed the color um to I don't know red and
23:19
white and now that is a different product that he's going to be selling.
23:22
So just making micro developments in your product could differentiate you
23:25
from a drop shipper to a micro brand. But again when you go to the the
23:30
supplier and ask him to change the color he's going to ask you for again a
23:32
minimum order quantity. So you only do this once you have validation. Uh but
23:36
this is how you eventually scale and become a micro brand that we keep
23:40
speaking about. Now you guys have heard of Kickstarter, right?
23:46
How many of you don't know Kickstarter? How many of you know Kickstarter?
23:49
Cool. So Kickstarter is a website where it's a crowdfunding website where people
23:53
basically post the uh you know the products that they want to develop and
23:57
they have a pledge. So, for example, for this massaging bath pillow, um there's a
24:03
$4,000 goal, and they basically raise money from the average Joe or anyone who
24:08
wants to pledge. Now, I can say with a certain degree of
24:14
confidence that this massaging bath pillow, even though this might be a
24:17
different design, but I could go on Alibaba, type this exact same thing, and
24:21
find something similar. So what I want to do is go on Kickstarter, see which
24:26
product is getting a lot of funding because that tells me that the customer
24:29
is interested. By the way, whoever is funding this wants to buy the product.
24:33
That's the whole point. So if I see that, you know, a lot of people are
24:36
funding a certain Kickstarter project, that means that they're interested in
24:38
the product. Therefore, if I find something similar to this in China, then
24:42
I can sell it and write the trend. You can also see the key features and just
24:46
go through the entire listing on exactly what their marketing angle is. Even by
24:50
the way, if you want to know how to market the product, literally it's all
24:53
there because they are doing it for you. So there's a story section where they
24:56
tell you about the entire product, what's the story, and they're trying to
25:00
convince you to buy, which is essentially the marketing right now. The
25:03
next tool is an ad spy tool. Okay, so imagine spying on all the ads available
25:09
on the internet. Basically, it's a tool called Minia. This is how it looks. And
25:13
essentially, what you could do is you could place all these filters. Like
25:18
for example, I would sort by countries. Pick four. US, UK, Canada, Australia.
25:22
These are the four countries I want to be looking for. And I want to see what's
25:25
really working in these four countries. The next thing I want to do is sort all
25:29
the ads by shares. So whichever ad has the most shares will pop up on top. I
25:34
don't like doing likes because likes can be faked, but usually shares and
25:37
comments are the ones which people don't fake or are hard to fake. So therefore,
25:42
whichever, so for example, that ad has like I don't know like 73,000 shares.
25:46
And I know this is popping. So that way I can find products, right? Um you can
25:50
also check their Tik Tok ad section and their Pinterest ad section um to find
25:55
what's working on Tik Tok and Pinterest to find products which are going viral.
25:59
Um so there are a lot of filters here. You can like literally put the filter
26:02
and find an ad which matches your filter. And a winning ad is in drop
26:06
shipping is basically a winning product. So that's super helpful. The next thing
26:10
is the same tool but there's this tool called magic search. If you find a
26:15
product image, just upload it here and then this magic search will find you the
26:19
supplier, the ads, the competitors, everything. All you need to do is just
26:22
upload a single image and it does all the heavy lifting. So just enter a text
26:26
or upload an image like just go like find me a product which is a I don't
26:31
know like a butter massager and it's going to go do the work for you which is
26:34
yeah all the tools free or do they require
26:39
subscription? Not all of them are free. Um, so Minia
26:43
and Trend Rocket are paid. They do have a free trial, but the ones after this
26:47
are free. Yeah.
26:51
Now, for example, this one's free. It's called Exploding Topics. And
26:53
essentially, what you could do is look for different categories and tabs. Try
26:58
find similar products and use them. So, let me give you an example. I was just
27:01
surfing around and these are all the exploding topics in the world right now
27:06
being tracked. So for example, there's this AI necklace which is like some
27:11
wearable technology device with smart features and this is the kind of graph
27:16
I'm looking for, right? This is what a trend looks like. You want to catch the
27:18
product down there so you can write the entire wave and that's basically drop
27:21
shipping. So essentially I'm looking for graphs like this which have an insane
27:25
growth and therefore I can find similar products or most likely the exact same
27:31
product, market it better and sell it. Um for example, even this red light
27:36
panel on the right, right? So I went on Google um search went uh Google trends
27:41
and then put United States past 12 months and I'm seeing this steady graph
27:46
going up which basically means um that there's demand for this. So I'm backing
27:50
my entire research with data. Um this one is a free tool. It's a very new
27:57
tool. I think I've been using it for the past few months. So this is Alibaba's
28:01
AI. Okay. They've just launched this and it's pretty cool because essentially all
28:05
the products on Alibaba are now categorized into this. So here's what I
28:09
did. Okay, this is when we start using Agentic AI to basically do our product
28:13
research. I gave it a prompt. Find trending physical products with low
28:17
saturation, minimum order quantity, 50 to 100 units that are showing growing
28:22
demand online. Prioritize products that solve daily problems, are lightweight
28:25
for shipping, and can retail for 3 to 4x the supply cost. This must be a physical
28:30
product. uh I need products for and then you can insert your niche like it's like
28:34
for example I I did pet grooming okay and here's when the agent starts going
28:38
to work so you can just sit back relax and this is the agent working for you um
28:42
and here's what it gave me so that was a single prompt you guys can copy it and
28:46
just paste it and just in include the niche that you want to be in
28:50
and here's what it told it gave me a comprehensive
28:54
price range analys analysis and market potential so it gave me these five
28:57
products which is the waterless spray the smart brushes eco-friendly gloves.
29:01
It gave me the wholesale price. It gave me the retail price. What is the markup
29:05
ratio of 4x and profit margin is 75 and we're looking for 60. So that's pretty
29:09
healthy also. Yeah. Sorry.
29:19
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So you could go for a
29:24
niche store with with all these things and like I said increase your like that.
29:27
Correct. Um but this is all like agentic doing the work. So, it's like basically
29:31
scraping entire entirety of Alibaba and the internet and finding you something.
29:35
And again, I'm not going to go through this, but it's giving you data on why
29:38
these products work. So, for example, this one was the first one. Uh, the
29:42
grooming sprays and wipes. It matched all eight out of eight requirements that
29:47
we shared with the AI. Um, this was the next one which was this AI enhanced
29:53
smart grooming tool for pets. Um, it also gives me the supplier for that
29:58
product. So I can just directly reach out to that person and source the
30:01
product. And this is by the way all done with a single prompt. Okay. The next
30:06
thing I'm going to be using is GPT deep research. So here's the prompt. I'm not
30:11
going to read the whole thing. You guys can kind of copy it. But what I'm
30:14
basically telling GPT is find me. You're my expert branded drop shipping product
30:19
research specialist. Find me five products which meet all these criterias.
30:23
Okay? And then also include what is the monthly traffic? What is the AOV? What
30:28
problem does it solve? Why is it evergreen? Blah blah blah. All these
30:30
things just copy paste it. But make sure you click the deep research on chat GPD,
30:34
not the normal one. So it's going to take about 15 minutes to do the entire
30:38
task. So be patient. But when it's done, this is what it's going to look like. So
30:44
okay, it's asking a few questions. It's like, okay, I'll research five
30:46
emotionally or physically problem-solving evergreen beauty
30:50
products meeting all your specified criteria. Are you open to skincare,
30:54
healthcare, blah blah blah? Should these product appeal to a specific
30:57
demographic? Do you want to sell to women 25 to 45? Gen Z's who do you
31:01
prefer? US-based suppliers or international suppliers? This is what I
31:05
said. I'm like, I'm open to all categories. Demographics are flexible.
31:08
International suppliers are also acceptable. Now, it gets to work. And
31:12
this is basically the agent doing the work, finding out stuff for us. Um, and
31:17
here are some of the results it gave me. So, there was this hair removal handset.
31:22
Um, but then what caught my eye was this Flex Series electrical head shaver which
31:28
is selling for about $100 a pop. Um, this is what it looks like, right? Um,
31:34
and you can find something like this exactly
31:38
or something uh similar to this on Alibaba or the suppliers that I give
31:42
you. So again, it's tell it's telling me why it's evergreen. It's telling me uh
31:48
what the pro what's the problem it solves. Um, you know, what is the
31:51
website? So this way I get a lot of data in terms of what's really working in the
31:55
market and most of the research is done not through us but through AI right
31:59
which is interesting. Um but yeah guys here's the assignment for you all. I
32:04
gave you a product research framework. What you have to do now is short list 20
32:08
potential products. Uh apply the criterias that I've given you and put it
32:12
on the product arsenal sheet. So we start with 20 products and then once I
32:18
give you feedback and they're reviewed then you can start testing them. um one
32:22
by one and yeah see where you go from there. So yeah, I think that's it for
32:26
today in terms of product research. I hope you guys liked it.
32:36
I think we have another one. How many of you have set up your companies?
32:41
Okay, so let's just uh this is like a quick
32:45
one, guys. I'm not going to take too long for this. Um
32:48
but it it's essentially about um yeah company formation.
33:10
Cool. So, uh, yeah. Um, and where are you guys thinking of forming your
33:14
company? Do you have an idea? Sorry.
33:18
Okay. Dubai. So, why is company formation uh
33:23
important? Firstly, you do not get any payment processing till you have your
33:28
company sorted. Of course, if you have a Dubai registered company, there's a good
33:32
level of international credibility uh because Dubai registered companies uh
33:37
are recognized worldwide. So, the operations are smoother. That doesn't
33:41
mean you have to set up a company in Dubai and I'll get to that. Now, when to
33:45
formalize? It's critical that you guys do it like now because um this takes
33:50
time. The formation takes time. Even after you get the company formation,
33:54
then the bank account takes time. Once you get the bank account, the
33:56
processing, the PayPal, the Stripe, everything takes time. So, you got to
34:00
start right now. And if you haven't, you should literally after this this this
34:05
lecture, right? Um here's what you need if you want to set up a company in
34:10
Dubai. You need uh again the first point is a bit gray. So, uh you can speak to
34:15
Kiti or someone about it, but like you need an Emirates ID, you need a company
34:19
registration certificate, business license, personal documents, and a
34:23
business bank account. Um this is if you need a company in Dubai. Um here's what
34:28
you need for PayPal. Okay, which is probably going to be your most important
34:31
payment processor. Without this you can't expect accept payments which means
34:34
you don't have a business. So you need a business registration certificate. You
34:38
need company license details. You need personal documents like your ID, proof
34:41
of business and you need banking. Stripe the second payment processor. Um
34:47
you need again pretty much the same stuff. Um but let me ask you this. What
34:52
do you think the difference between Stripe and PayPal is? Why do we need
34:54
both? Different countries.
34:58
Yeah. Okay. Anyone else? So,
35:04
Stripe gives you Visa, Mastercard and all the other processors. Whereas PayPal
35:09
gives you um again the PayPal badge. The stores or the websites which do not
35:15
have PayPal versus the ones who do have PayPal, the conversions on both of them
35:18
will vary. the one with PayPal will have higher conversion rates because for the
35:23
customer if you have PayPal they trust you because in PayPal they can dispute
35:26
things get their money back so they're like okay even if I order something and
35:29
if it's not the way I like it I can always get a refund so you need to have
35:32
both the last thing is Shopify payments um
35:39
this is a payment processor that Shopify gives you but again for this also you
35:43
need your company so basically you need your company for everything without your
35:45
company setup you do not get any processor and therefore you can't Well,
35:49
um, so, so you need personal documentation. It's pretty much the same
35:52
for all three. You can have Shopify or Stripe. You can't have both. So, usually
35:56
the combination is PayPal, Stripe, PayPal, Shopify. You can't have all
35:59
three. But what I would say is get all three because if you get banned on one,
36:02
you have a backup. And the chances of getting banned are high in drop
36:06
shipping. So, it's not high, but it's possible at least. So, if I have a
36:10
backup processor, um, it just gives me more like confidence on scaling the
36:14
product because even when you scale, they start holding your money. I spoke
36:17
about that yesterday. If I have a backup processor, I like I have more um you
36:21
know advantages than someone who doesn't basically. So um yeah, you can set up
36:27
your account in Dubai or your international country, whichever
36:29
whichever one is faster. Do you have to register in Dubai? You
36:34
don't. Um you can also go for your home country. Um but even if we were sitting
36:39
somewhere else right now uh I would recommend Dubai as as a company
36:44
structure because firstly the taxation is very efficient like you pay nothing
36:49
to like minimal taxes in Dubai versus let's say if you're in Europe or in the
36:52
US you're paying like 20 30 40%. Um so you save on taxes and PayPal okay even
36:59
when it comes to processing PayPal Dubai is different to PayPal US. Let me
37:04
explain. Every jurisdiction has a different PayPal and what I've seen is
37:07
PayPal US is stricter than any other PayPal. So if you have a Dubai PayPal,
37:11
I've seen that to be more lenient and that is going to be helpful because the
37:15
chances of you getting banned are lesser because it's lenient, right?
37:20
So u here's why it's ideal. Like I said, you get a streamlined setup. uh the
37:25
Dubai setup you get international recognition you get global credibility
37:29
and also you get a tax friendly environment because uh money saved is
37:33
money earned so if you save on taxes or I would say optimize your taxes then
37:38
that's going to help you um but yeah that's the recap recap of model 4 guys
37:42
timing is critical get your company set up ASAP yeah
37:57
I think you can but like just double check with the team. Um yeah. Yeah. So
38:02
yeah, timing is critical guys when if you can sell something in your home
38:05
country do that if you think Dubai is the right structure for you. Yeah.
38:38
Okay, cool. Cool guys. So, payment processing,
38:50
documentation, you need your banking and then if you want to go for the Dubai
38:54
setup, I think it's personally um an advantage. But yeah, that's your module
38:58
4 recap. So, today we learn about how to find the right products. You have an
39:01
assignment for that and then you set up your companies. U and yeah, guys, that's
39:05
it for today. So, yeah, hope you guys enjoyed it. Hope you guys learned
39:08
something new and I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah,
39:19
sure. Sure. Yeah, sure. There is als
39:39
figureate questions. Go ahead.
39:46
Yeah, I have a question. So earlier focusing on organic traffic. So that
40:01
means not right now. We understand we know what work
40:15
organic traffic that's
40:25
down to 30 competition
40:30
increase will But then also of course
40:35
Yeah, definitely. Like if if you if you're going organic first um then you
40:40
have that advantage because if someone's paying 20 bucks on ads then he has to
40:44
mark his price up to 50. You could go for 30 because you're basically paying
40:47
nothing. That way you can obviously out compete the person. But then again,
40:53
am I going to say that organics work all the time? I'd be lying if that's the
40:56
truth. Okay. So, it's a bit of a um it's a bit of a hit and miss with things. Um
41:03
I mean that's even the ads are hit or miss, right? Like nothing works for
41:06
sure. I think my advice would be to try organics, make it work, but you can't
41:10
get married to that process that if because you have to dump it at some
41:13
point that okay, this isn't working. I got to shift to ads.
41:28
organic traffic. Yeah, definitely. So, like for example,
41:37
if you post once twice a day for the next 10 days, you paste uh 20 pieces of
41:43
content on Tik Tok, you see which one does well and then what I would do is me
41:48
the top three uh reels of Tik Toks to do well, I would patch them up into an ad
41:52
uh and then try and run that. And then
42:04
there. Yeah, of course. If it's in the
42:17
checkout, it's also on the website. There's no chance that it can be on
42:20
checkout only, not the website. So, it's going to be across the website. You can
42:23
also sell to the person post purchase which called which is called a post
42:27
purchase upsell which is basically once he sees the thank you page after buying
42:31
your uh product you could be like hey like let's say it's something that you
42:35
can buy twice let's say it's a pair of socks bad example but you get the point
42:38
you're like cool you you liked our socks you bought it here's the next piece of
42:43
set of socks for 50% off so you pay you you get more money out of the person
42:47
post the purchase itself so the whole idea is to sell the customer at
42:50
different points Yeah.
42:54
Yeah. So I'm saying isn't the cost too much
42:59
for us to start with because if I like I did a search it was 20,000 just to set
43:03
up. So would you say that's like what other options are that?
43:09
I mean like I said the options are Dubai or it's your home country right like
43:12
yeah $400. Yeah.
43:18
I feel like you have like the problem again with it's where are you doing your
43:22
business? Are you going to be selling in India? Are you going to be selling
43:24
outside? Where the previous business we were selling in
43:30
India and then you were selling all across the world. We didn't have one
43:36
country. Um okay because like the thing is if you
43:40
want to operate from India and sell outside it's a nightmare in terms of
43:43
getting PayPal, getting Stripe. um that there's a lot of red tape
43:50
essentially to do that. So going and setting up an international company to
43:53
sell international is the name of the game. Dubai is a setup you can you can
43:57
try Hong Kong but every company setup takes a certain amount like u nothing so
44:01
free right even in the US it's about $200 I think.
44:05
Yeah it's pretty hard. Yeah I know but then in the long in the
44:08
grand scheme of things what you have to understand is in the US you pay like a
44:12
good percentage of tax. So you have to balance that out and take that call
44:16
because you have to set up the company. Yeah.
44:28
Both keywords for products on Google trends and also and also problems and
44:32
also niches all three. Yeah.
44:36
What do you think is the best way to any of What has been the best for you? Was
44:44
it organic? Uh ads
44:47
or ads is the best thing? I'm not saying it's the best, but that's
44:50
what I've used the most because with organic to be honest um there's a
44:55
certain scale like think of it right like if the platform is not going to
44:58
give you traffic for free at a certain point. It's just going to be like come
45:01
spend money on my platform. That's how they make money. So it's going to give
45:04
you organic reach to a certain point but then it's just going to be like cool
45:07
that's it man. Now you want more traffic pay me.
45:12
Yeah. Would you also switch to Google? Um, yeah, Google ads, sure. But like the
45:19
thing with Google ads is you want like uh not everything sells on Google. So
45:23
think of it like anything which people search for. Like for example, if I want
45:26
to buy a scissor, I'm not going to buy a scissor from a drop shipping website,
45:30
I'm just going to search for it, right? Versus if I see some cool trending
45:33
product, I don't even know that exists, but it just pops up on my feed and
45:36
that's impulse buy. So if your product makes that cut for Google, sure. But
45:41
most drop shipping products are not searchable. They're more like if you see
45:43
it, you like it, you buy it, right? Then yeah,
45:48
cool, guys. Any more questions? Okay. So, I think Ravi, we're Okay.
45:57
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think we have this uh
46:03
private one-on-one. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We know that. I wanted
46:07
to ask you what we have for this week or next week.
46:15
Yeah. So, firstly, you're going to start off with shortlisting the 20 products.
46:18
Um find those 20 products. Um come up with um so yeah, the main thing is the
46:23
products for now. Get your companies in place. Uh tomorrow we're going to be
46:26
speaking about how to find the right suppliers. So, I'm going to the
46:30
assignment for that is like okay, you found the product, but go find the
46:33
supplier for it. and not just the supplier but the supplier which gives
46:36
you the best pricing and the fastest shipping. So I think all of those things
46:40
are something you would have to get prepared before uh we meet next time.
46:45
Cool. I think uh yeah the questions are done. So
46:51
Oh sorry uh do you prefer like a single product
46:54
store or multiple products in one? I prefer multiple because with single
46:59
products like again the product Yeah. The product flywheel can't get
47:03
activated. So, okay. But you can hear me, right?
47:12
I think it's dead. Okay. Yeah, I think they can hear me
47:16
though. Yeah.
47:21
Okay, it's up now. Cool. Anything else, guys?
47:25
Sorry. I think Yeah, that's it.
47:35
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. But like not the
47:43
entire thing. So, we'll cover that in the ads module. So, I would definitely
47:47
use parts of it, but not the entire thing because um Yeah. So, for example,
47:52
there's Hicksfield, which we use uh Hicksfield AI, and the UGC content is
47:56
like super real. You can't tell the difference. Um so yeah we can use it but
48:02
not just that. Yeah. Yeah. So just set up a VPN right uh VPN
48:15
USA IP Tik Tok. You can't post with a VPN because you
48:21
won't get the reach. Um, so when you post you kind of it'll only show to so
48:26
the hack for that is like you have to get a different sim and stuff like that.
48:29
So if you post you have to be in that country or whoever is posting for you
48:33
should be in that country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
48:41
So you said it.
48:52
So the suppliers I'm going to give you access to have like a wide like
48:55
selection. So he could bas those guys basically can source anything which is
49:00
in China and it's not very complicated. All you
49:04
have to do is give them like a picture or an AliExpress link and then they go
49:07
and do the work for you. Yeah.
49:10
Yeah, but you just chat. I mean, I have been working with uh some of my
49:16
suppliers and I've never spoken to them on the phone. It's been just chat. So,
49:20
they're pretty pretty efficient like that. Yeah.
49:23
Cool. First, how do we identify?
49:37
How long is Uh okay. So the way you identify as you
49:43
sell if when you're losing money, right? Yeah.
49:49
No. So you so what we're going to do is we're going to have a specific budget to
49:53
test product. So I'm going to give you like okay you can't it's like a stop
49:55
loss in trading. You know what I mean? You can't spend more than this. If you
49:58
do not get results in this budget that means that you need to dump the product
50:02
and move on. That's why we have 20 on the list so that one of them works. So
50:05
my next question is by dumping the product
50:10
you have to set up a new website. No, no, no. It's on the same website,
50:13
right? It's a different product page. We spoke about how most of the traffic
50:17
doesn't even go to the homepage. Yeah. Yeah, you could. But like I would just
50:33
say that um if you're sure if you can you can yeah but not too many because
50:39
you can't have like 30 accounts like Yeah. Maybe three four is fine. Three
50:45
four is fine. Cool. Question.
50:55
Yeah. Okay.
51:02
Cool guys. I think that's it. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

Branding & Shopify Setup
15/09/2025 | 12:00 PM - 01:30 PM
Mr. Ishan Suri
0:00
branded looking website. Um, and what are the tools we're going to be using?
0:06
Nothing crazy. Um, it's actually pretty simple. People over complicated. So, let
0:11
me simplify the over complicated for you guys. Now, the first thing is um
0:19
Okay, stop working. Is are you doing that? Okay,
0:28
cool. So the first thing is branding essentials. Um I feel like the core
0:33
elements here are the brand name, logo, color palette. This is something you
0:37
guys already know. Um what does good branding get us? It gets
0:42
us instant credibility. Um so a good brand builds trust even for new stores
0:48
through professional experience. So for example, there could be a website which
0:51
could be like there for like 5 years but if it looks shabby, doesn't look that
0:55
great, people don't trust it versus your website which could be a week old but
0:59
because of the branding um people trust you. So it's not even about to do with
1:04
of course when it's brands like Coke and Pepsi and Apple um you know people have
1:09
this ring to it but for a new brand it is the way you look which will create
1:13
the trust. Um and customer association it's a clean professional branding uh
1:19
which which signals reliability to uh visitors right so
1:27
I don't know what's yeah it just stops working and then it start
1:35
so yeah I picked out like this uh website this is a drop shipping store
1:39
called SmartBud now um it's pretty simple this product actually clears like
1:45
uh instead of using like earbuds, you could use this device to clean your
1:48
ears. And this guy completely micro branded it. So something pretty simple.
1:53
He's got this whole um doctor kind of image over there to create trust with
1:57
the customer and it has a minimal design. Premium visuals. These guys have
2:01
been around for a while like I think they've been rub shipping for the last
2:04
two three years. You can always go check them out. Check their ads out. Check
2:07
their website out. Um I think can you just Yeah. Can you can
2:15
can you do it? Okay, cool. So yeah, the the next one is
2:30
Yeah. No, no, just go back. Go back.
2:41
Cool. So again, I'm going to be really emphasizing on why branding matters. So
2:47
um as you grow, this becomes your competitive edge, right? This is what
2:51
differentiates you from people in the market. Um and as you bring traffic, um
2:56
branding decides if the customer will trust you to buy from you or not. Like
3:00
this is literally the binary decision on if someone decides to buy or not.
3:08
The significance of branding is also very important. Uh we make emotional
3:12
connections. So branding creates bonds where customers trust, recommend and
3:17
recommend like uh return to your business. There's customer retention. We
3:21
spoke about that. Why do people coming come back and buy from your website? And
3:25
of course there's uh a professional signal which demonstrates long-term
3:30
commitment to your customers. Um and and this kind of takes you above the whole
3:35
price competition. Everyone's trying to price lower in drop shipping. Um so so
3:40
being a good or having a website which is branded well will always make you
3:45
charge more for the same product. So you're going to be having people sell
3:48
sell selling the same product. Of course, you know, it's China. A lot of
3:51
you will have access to the same product and the entire world has access to the
3:54
same product. But you will see that there will be certain websites which
3:57
should be selling the same product for let's say $100 and there'll be someone
4:01
selling it for 40. And the only difference in that $60 delta is the fact
4:06
that the one selling it at 100 has a better branding experience. Of course,
4:10
it's not just the branding on um the website, but he's probably going to have
4:14
branding across the board. A lot of people over here asked me if I could
4:17
sell high ticket products. And you literally have to nail this part if you
4:21
think of going above the 150 AOV. Um so that is why it's super important.
4:32
Cool. Um trust building. What are the trust building elements? Um because
4:38
online customers hesitate because they cannot see who you are. Most of them
4:42
don't know you. Um and the first uh sort of line of defense you have is to create
4:47
this trust, right? So you have reviews, testimonials,
4:51
UGC's, so user generated content, guarantees and clear policies. Like
4:56
these are elements over here which I will have across the board on the
4:59
website. I'll have it on the homepage, I'm going to have it on the product
5:02
page, I'm going to have it on checkout, I'm going to have it on the add to cart
5:05
like I'm going to have it in the cart. So any of these so be it the reviews,
5:09
testimonials, the UGC or the guarantees and clear policies. this is something
5:13
that I'm going to have across like whenever you look at a certain page on
5:16
your website ask yourself how many of these trust elements do I have on each
5:21
page or each section and my uh of course suggestion would be that as many as you
5:28
can. So let me ask you a question like how would you maybe
5:32
um what do you think are out of these five can you induce in your cart? So you
5:37
know when you add to cart this thing pops up your cart showing up and it says
5:40
check out. What do you think you can add trust elements in your cart?
5:50
So you have very minimal space. You know the cart looks really small like the
5:53
popup the pop out cart. Yeah. So, what do you think you can like
5:58
add to your cart? Like you have very little space. The cart's going to show
6:01
your product. It's going to show checkout. That's all you have. It's this
6:04
much space. What can you add? Okay.
6:23
Fair enough. Anyone else? check out.
6:32
Cool. But that is urgency. It's not trust. So what you're saying is actually
6:36
there we want to do that. But that is to create urgency for them to check out now
6:40
so they don't bounce off. I'm talking about trust. So what I could also do is
6:45
um of course we're going to be adding guarantees and we're not going to be
6:48
using text. We're going to be using those infographics, right? Like those
6:51
badges like 30-day money back guarantee. the badges because the badges text is
6:56
always boring um infographics or images visuals is always better right so I'm
7:01
going to be using um guarantees uh choice show
7:10
also what I would add is maybe even a testimonial so let's say if it's a
7:14
checkout button right below that I'll have like five golden stars and I would
7:18
have some sixword testimonial about a customer which is basically just nud
7:23
nudging the guy right now that this XYZ customer had a positive experience and
7:28
it's right below. So you got to get smart with how you use these trust
7:31
alerts, right? Um the next thing is reduce friction. So professional
7:35
experience lowers customer hesitation. I also feel like the longer your checkout
7:41
is, the lower chances you have of actually converting that customer. So
7:45
you got to reduce friction and at the same time look professional. We're going
7:48
to be covering that in the later modules on how do we reduce friction from like
7:52
lesser steps checkout and then of course higher conversion. Strong banding leads
7:57
to increased loyalty in sales. I think I'm kind of like hammering this point.
8:01
Um and then long-term vision guys. Uh brand branding compounds like an
8:05
investment. It grows in value over time versus a non-branding asset that you
8:10
have does not compound and does not grow in value. So your logo, color, story
8:15
becomes part of the customer memory as you explained it into your new products.
8:18
Branding keeps customers loyal. Um, think of branding as building equity in
8:23
your business. It's not actual equity you can see or it's not going to be on
8:27
your profit or your balance sheet, but it is something which is in the air and
8:31
it will build equity which will of course uh reward you in the long term um
8:36
for people to make you buy from you. Okay.
8:46
All right. Right. So, here are the core pillars of
9:00
branding. We've got the brand name. Pretty simple, memorable, simple, and
9:05
relevant to your audience. I want you guys to be very smart here. Like I had
9:08
some people who are literally naming the niche in their brand name. So let's say
9:12
they're calling it xyztech.com. Never do that. Okay. I would suggest
9:18
because if you guys remember, we're going to be most of you are going to be
9:21
putting all your products on one website. So I want you to use a brand
9:25
name which basically means nothing like if you know what I mean. It should be
9:29
catchy. Uh people say use a four-letter brand name like uh I don't know like
9:35
Ford, Dell, most of the big brands in the world have four letters in him. So
9:40
use a four-letter brand name. I would go for something with a S or a zed. It's
9:46
more catchy with the phonetics. And I won't really make it mean anything.
9:51
Okay. So like I would like call it like a zappy or something. It doesn't mean
9:56
anything because then what I can do is I could call it Zappy electronics. I could
10:00
call it Zappy Toys. I could rebrand my website into anything that I want. So,
10:05
pick something very general which does not um basically interfere with any
10:09
niche because if you go into a niche um then that makes it hard for you guys to
10:12
actually pick a certain um rebrand to a certain niche. Logo, again, pretty
10:17
basic. You've got a color palette over here.
10:20
I'm going to show you guys how to get the right color palette. Um and then you
10:24
have imagery and continuity. So, it should look the same.
10:30
Now, let's simplify our branding efforts. Um, rule of thumb, spend only
10:34
as much time on branding as your first customers will spend looking at your
10:39
logo. So, don't spend too much time. Um, you want AI to do the heavy lifting for
10:44
you and make it easier for yourself. So, don't over complicate things in the
10:48
beginning. Early branding should be simple, clean, and functional. And
10:51
wasting days or weeks on a logo is something which will set you back. So
10:56
you want to spend like if someone looks at your branding logo for like I don't
11:00
know five minutes you shouldn't spend more than maybe 20 minutes on your logo
11:03
and because this AI is going to be making it for you and making it easier
11:06
for you right now. Again choosing a business name uh your business name is
11:11
the first impression. It should reflect the essence of your product or service.
11:15
Um I think you should go with something super super general in the beginning
11:20
because if you tie your down like let's say you name your brand like XYZ
11:23
apparel. Now you have to sell clothes which is again a problem here because
11:28
you cannot reband. Excuse me guys here. Cool. Um
11:34
ensuring originality naming. So here's what I would do as steps to make sure
11:39
that I have the name. So again you have Google searches which is completely fine
11:43
but I also want to be looking for domains. I see a lot of people getting
11:46
confused that should we go for com should we go for whatever. It doesn't
11:50
really matter to be very honest. You could go.co co you could go do com you
11:54
could go do whatever your wherever your country uh or where you're selling
11:58
because you need to understand that when someone clicks on shop now and goes to
12:02
your website the links already there on in the CTA so you doesn't really have to
12:06
type it out and your search from traffic the domain really matters when you have
12:10
a lot of search term traffic so someone's searching for your website
12:13
which in drop shipping doesn't happen a lot so you just have to go for a domain
12:17
check just get whatever you can the cheapest option you get a domain for
12:21
like just doesn't have to be something crazy. Um, then again, trademark search.
12:26
This, by the way, is not a must. Um, but if you're really thinking of doing this
12:31
longterm, then I think trademarks also make sense. And then, of course, keep it
12:36
simple. Uh, short, simple, and globally relevant names work best. Like I said,
12:39
four-letter words um is what they say is supposed to be something that they um
12:45
kind of people understand the most easiestly. So, I'd keep it simple like
12:50
that. Now, here's some AI tools that I use for naming. Um, there's of course
12:54
chat GPD. There's this one called name licks. You basically give a few prompts
12:59
and then it gives you a bunch of uh brand names along with the logo and the
13:04
color palette. Right. Then you have copy.ai also for brand name ideas. Um,
13:10
you can just have quick generation. Excuse me guys over there. You guys
13:14
pick. Yep, you guys. So AI generated dozens of variations
13:19
based on tone, niche, and personality. So you can set a personality for your
13:23
brand. Just give it the prompt and then uh it's going to generate it for you.
13:26
Here's a default prompt that I kind of gave you guys. You can use this or use
13:29
something similar like generate 10 unique brand names for a modern um I
13:34
don't know like home e-commerce brand name should be short, easy to pronounce,
13:38
globally relevant, trustworthy, and premium. A simple prompt like this is
13:43
what you could use. Now, here are some logo design principles I want you guys
13:47
to kind of keep in mind. Keep it simple. Simple, versatile, and scalable logos
13:52
make your store look professional from day one. Um, it has to align with your
13:56
niche. I would say this step comes in in the second phase when you have decided
14:01
that let's say I I am going into a microniche kids brand or I'm going into
14:06
a microniche apparel brand. This does not maybe align in the beginning. Um and
14:10
then of course typography based use clean fonts if stuck there enough at the
14:15
start and then scalable design should look good in
14:19
small and large packaging because eventually you guys might be private
14:22
labeling. Right? So here are some design tips. Define the brand name first.
14:27
Choose your color scheme. Uh go for a clean typography. Review your templates.
14:32
I'm going to show you what a template looks like. It's super basic and avoid
14:35
any clutter. Okay. Um now for logo design. Here are some of the air tools I
14:40
use. I use Luca and Logo AI. Then I have Canva AI and I also use Midjourney for
14:46
logo creation. Um again a prompt for midjourney minimal modern logo for let's
14:53
say home brand, e-commerce brand in this niche. Uh and then I go for flat design,
14:58
bold typography and a vector style so that I can download this image in any
15:03
way. Um here's why a color palette is super important. People take it as
15:08
something which they can just randomly pick. Um but color shapes the perception
15:12
before words do in the customer's mind. So I want to be going for two to three
15:17
primary colors and one to two secondary colors maximum. So primary impact first
15:22
visual elements um customers notice. So some for example if you have something
15:27
which is yellow and black yellow is usually usually a color for energy right
15:32
like it just symbolizes energy. So depending on whichever brand you have,
15:35
like if I had a kids brand, I would probably go for yellow because, you
15:39
know, I want mothers to see it and get excited for their children. So it does
15:44
matter. A lot of people skip this step because they're like, it doesn't matter.
15:46
Like colors are not going to make a big deal, but trust me, the small things
15:50
matter when you want to build something nice. And then
15:54
uh you have recognition building and then premium feel. So give it a premium
15:58
feel. Right? Here's some psychology again. Uh, blue
16:02
is trust, security and reliability. Green is health, eco-friend,
16:06
eco-friendly sustainability. Red is urgency also energy and power. And then
16:12
you have black and white which is minimal luxury and timelessness which is
16:17
what Yeah. Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could go for
16:26
any shade of blue. So when you have a palette like you saw
16:30
like there's there's like this whole uh gradient of colors you can pick from
16:34
like a gradient of blue. So light blue, dark blue. Yeah. Yeah.
16:40
Now AI tools for color palettes. Again some of the AI tools coolers.co Chroma
16:45
um they these tools generate color palettes for you um using AI. And of
16:51
course you've got chat GBD again put in a default prompt for you guys. suggest
16:55
three professional color palettes for uh whatever your niche is. Include two
16:59
primary and two secondary colors that evoke X emotion. You can just put this
17:03
prompt and these guys help you. Um you could also use something as basic
17:08
as Pinterest, man. If you go on Pinterest and you just search for color
17:12
palettes or you go for aesthetic color palettes, minimalist brand color scheme,
17:17
luxury combinations, here's what it's going to look like and you can just go
17:20
on Pinterest and just download this file, right? And then you're going to
17:22
get the color palettes. Now, let's say if I was building something, and this is
17:26
super basic, but if I wanted something for a kitchen cleaner brand, and this
17:30
was the product, this is how my brand kit would look. I would have multiple
17:34
color palettes because I want this uh it's a kitchen cleaner. I wanted to
17:38
signify like uh freshness, right? So with the lemons, you've got the lemons,
17:43
you've got this blue, which is again a fresh blue, and then you've got uh over
17:48
here you can see there's another color palette scheme. And then I would have a
17:51
heading font, a subheading font, and a little bit of a smaller font. So at
17:56
least three fonts also along with this. And this is what you guys have to build
18:01
even before you build your website. Um I would also of course slap on my logo
18:05
somewhere over here. Um but this is what you would need before you build your
18:08
website. And you would want this uniformity not just on your website but
18:13
your social media pages, your ads, everything should go after this brand
18:18
kit is technically built which is what you guys would have to do now. Build
18:21
this brand kit for your for your uh business, right? Um again product photos
18:28
should be high quality should they should be in the certain aspect ratio.
18:33
For example, Shopify wants a certain aspect ratio which is,080 by,80. should
18:38
be in the same aspect ratio and avoid any stock looking or inconsistent
18:42
photography. So none of that stock uh photo stuff. Use something like clicker
18:47
yourself or just use some really um AI AI generated uh stock like photos which
18:53
are not stock looking. They look very real. Uh now here are some AI tools for
18:58
imagery. You've got Midjourney, you've got Dali, you've got Sora AI which I use
19:02
a lot and then you've got Runway and Whiscom. Now, they're all different for
19:08
different use cases. So, this one over here generates lifestyle visuals with
19:12
product mockup. So, good for fashion, good for apparel. Then you got Sora AI
19:17
or runway. So, text to video for branded ads. You could just go text to video.
19:23
Yeah. using text text to video.
19:47
Well, if so in this the AI you're going to be using and especially I maybe
19:52
missed a tool over here which is also Hicksfield. I'll show you the ad and you
19:55
won't be able to tell it's AI. It's so real now, you know, because let's say
20:00
the the way it works is you get a AI output and then on top of that you add
20:05
this filter which gives it like the human texture everything. Um I believe
20:11
um a lot of the influencers are putting out AI ads for like even you know like
20:16
brands like Kylie Cosmetics which is like a billion dollar company super
20:20
influencer as an owner and they have AI ads now. It's all about does it look
20:24
real or not. So if you look at it and you're like, "Okay, this looks super AI.
20:28
Probably not going to use it." But there are ways of like making it making it
20:31
look super realistic so that you know they really can't tell. And by the way,
20:35
the whole ad is not made with AI. Parts of it are, you know what I mean? So
20:40
let's say you shoot some videos, you get some videos from influencers, and then
20:44
you have some AI, and then you patch it all together, and that becomes the ad.
20:50
Yeah. Yeah, V3, all of these tools, man, they they like Hicksfield, for example,
20:54
has like it's like all these tools in one dashboard. So, Hickfield AI, I we
20:58
use that a lot for our content and also for our uh e-commerce products and it's
21:02
super super real. And then you have Wishcom. So, this turns product sketches
21:07
into 3D renders. So, let's say if you just sketched it out, it would create
21:11
that sketch into a 3D render. Now again this I'm not sure how many of you guys
21:16
would be using that right now but let's say you get a P a proof of concept with
21:20
your product and then you want to build something on top of that with a sketch.
21:23
So this product would turn it into a 3D render. Um I've got a prompt here also
21:28
for you guys. So um again you can use these prompts along with these tools.
21:35
Yeah. Oh no, no, no. The 3D renders for like
21:47
product design. So like Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let's say if you
21:50
have a product already and you want to like build on top of it like later on
21:54
then you could just sketch it out and then build that design and then send it
21:57
to your manufacturer or send it to someone on China and be like hey I want
22:01
you to build this and then he's going to come back to you with the quotation like
22:04
cool I can do it here's the price and then you can literally create a product
22:07
which is so we call this micro innovation you haven't built something
22:10
from scratch but you built on top of an existing product and now the micro
22:14
innovation on top and then you can call it your product now.
22:18
Yeah, because you don't have to build everything from scratch, right?
22:22
Essentially, you have to work on top of something which is already working for
22:26
you. And this way, you minimalize your um your risk because essentially you've
22:30
tried the product, you've tried the basic version, now you're building out
22:33
this super advanced version of your product. And guess what? Only you have
22:37
access to this product, no one else. So that way you have a huge advantage
22:40
because people can't copy you. So now, okay, branded store psychology
22:45
in 5 seconds. Um customer judge your store in just 5 seconds. So the moment
22:50
they click on shop now they get on your website if they don't like your store on
22:54
5 4 3 2 1 they bounce. Uh most of the reason like a lot of people were asking
22:59
me like right like do people go on the homepage? No they don't. They see your
23:03
product page they see um above the fold. Uh do you guys know okay who who knows
23:08
what above the fold is? Yeah.
23:16
Sorry. Above the fold.
23:21
So essentially like if I it's your phone that the user. Okay. So like if they b
23:27
if they land on your website, whatever they see on this screen is called above
23:31
the fold. So whenever you have to scroll down to go to your website, anything
23:36
above that is called above the fold. Okay? So the first frame they see 95% of
23:42
customers bounce from there. So they see above the fold, they
23:48
3 to 5 seconds, they don't like it, they're gone. So the main thing we have
23:51
to optimize is your above the fold. So above the fold, what do you get? You
23:54
usually get a head uh a banner on top. You get your product images and then you
23:58
might have an add toart button. That's all they see. Looking at your above the
24:02
fold, they decide if they want to scroll down or not. So everything you've done
24:06
below that, all the good stuff is irrelevant if they don't like the above
24:10
the fold and they take 5 seconds to decide. So when people have to actually
24:15
optimize things, they really want to optimize the above the fold. Um what is
24:19
your branding? What are your color palettes? What are the images you're
24:22
using? What's the font? All those things make above the fold. So again, like I
24:26
said, clean design, trust elements. What I also like doing is um I like putting
24:31
badges on my so okay, what's a what's what's a hero photo? The first photo the
24:37
customer sees is called the hero photo. Okay, like that's the first image of
24:41
your product. And usually people use this white background product. That's
24:46
it. But what I like doing to it is like in that image, I'd like adding some
24:50
trust badges. So imagine the image is there. On the top right, I'll have my
24:53
30-day money back guarantee. So I'll add the trust badges in my hero photo
24:57
because the moment he land or I'll just say 7,000 five-star reviews because the
25:03
moment he sees my image, all he's seeing is not just the product, but he's also
25:06
seeing a lot of trust elements. And therefore my above the fold is optimized
25:11
and therefore the chances of them bouncing are lesser.
25:16
Right? Is that clear? Okay, cool.
25:21
Now here are some AI tools for branded store creation. Uh a lot of you came and
25:28
I believe a lot of you have built your websites already, but these two are the
25:32
main ones that I recommend. So there's Gem Pages. Um, so these guys build you
25:36
AIdriven landing pages with professional design and it's super super
25:40
customizable. You can drag, drop, edit, do whatever you want with gem pages.
25:45
I've been using these guys for the last four or five years and they're like I
25:48
think the best in the game. And then you have Atlas AI which kind of builds a
25:52
store in 30 seconds. Um, just you just have to put in your link and it builds
25:56
your store. So it's pretty easy guys to build a website. Um, this is not very
26:01
customizable this one. Um, but this one is. So whoever wants to just build
26:06
something out and start testing they could you they can use Atlas AI and for
26:10
the people who really want something super customized can go with gem pages.
26:16
I would say that in the beginning you can start with Atlas because if you are
26:20
testing products um rapidly then you don't have the time to build like the
26:25
best looking landing pages. So I would say start you could start with that and
26:29
then when you start getting sales you can build a custom one using gem pages.
26:33
If you guys think your team has the bandwidth to build um super super
26:38
professional designs from day one, then you could use gem pages. Again, it's
26:42
built on Shopify of course, but these tools are the ones which make it
26:46
customizable because you guys know how many of you start building a website.
26:51
Okay, so the ones who've built their website know that Shopify as a native
26:55
tool does not have a lot of customizing options. It's it's it's limited, right?
27:00
So therefore you need these tools to kind of come and help you out.
27:06
Now copyrightiting for stores guys is pretty simple. I've kind of like put
27:10
them into three sections which is homepage, product pages and checkout.
27:14
Okay. Um in the homepage what you want to communicate is your vision and your
27:18
trust. In your product page you want to deliver your value, your features and
27:23
the benefits. Again, you would again have trust here too, but you know, as as
27:28
I'm just saying as a differentiator and in your checkout, you would have
27:32
reassurance about payment and not just payment, but returns. If you don't like
27:38
what you bought, then you can get it. Um, there's a 30-day money back
27:42
guarantee. Um, I also like adding trust badges of PayPal because someone was
27:47
asking me, why is PayPal important? PayPal signifies trust. If someone sees
27:51
a PayPal badge on your store, they know you're legit. They don't trust you, but
27:55
they trust PayPal. So, they're like, "If I get screwed in any way, um, I will
28:00
PayPal will get my money back." And that alone will get you the sale, you know,
28:04
in the beginning because PayPal is a brand. We're not eventually maybe we
28:09
were, but at the moment, we got to be we got to piggyback someone else's brand
28:13
credibility to get our sale. You know what I mean? So, yeah, that's pretty
28:16
much it for here. Now, AI tools for store copy. I again
28:22
use chat GBD Pro, copy.AI, and I also use a lot of um um yeah, I think that's
28:28
pretty much it. I I I use these two. They're pretty much the same. Um so,
28:31
here are some default prompts that you can use to write compelling copy. Um and
28:36
then of course, this is very this is a very basic prompt. You got to be
28:40
improvising a lot more on top of that. Um but yeah, these are the tools that I
28:43
use for store copy. Cool. building trust and social proof.
28:49
So again, reviews, UGC, clear policies, higher conversion. Okay. Uh your refund
28:56
policy should be super clear. They should be on your homepage. They should
28:59
be on your product page. They should be everywhere. Um and they should be
29:03
extremely clear on how can I get a refund if I want one? How can I return
29:07
my product? The more detailed they are, the more the customer trusts you. And
29:10
therefore, make sure that your policies are super clear. A lot of people think
29:14
people don't actually go to the policy. Um, but they do. What I like doing is I
29:19
even like having my policy as a drop-down above the fold. So, let's say
29:23
if they land on the thing, you see those drop-own menus that they have. So, when
29:26
you click on it, just drops down. It doesn't take too much space because I
29:29
don't want to take too much space above the fold because I want to show as much
29:32
as I can. But, I have like refund policy right there. Um, and I won't literally
29:37
name it refund policy. I'm going to name it something like if you don't like it,
29:41
here's what you can do. Something like that. Click on it. Boom. Refund policy.
29:44
It builds trust above the fold and therefore I convince the customer to buy
29:48
from me. Right now in consistency breaks trust. Um so
29:54
yeah be consistent across your website, ads, email, social media. Same font,
30:00
same color. That's why you build the brand kit first and then you use that
30:03
exact brand kit along every channel. It's not like over here there's a
30:08
different font and over there there's a different font or the colors are
30:10
different. They're all the same and they all stem out. Even when you maybe hire
30:14
people going forward or you get um you know freelancers, you want to give them
30:18
the brand kit so that they can they can kind of um yeah they can they can use
30:23
that brand kit to build everything that you want from them.
30:29
Now here's how you organize your brand assets. You first have your brand folder
30:34
so you can create it in something super basic as Canva. So logos, fonts and
30:38
images. You have a brand pallet document. I kind of explained that. and
30:42
then you have team access for it. So give everything to your team and any
30:45
freelancers. You put them all in a folder and then you segment them in
30:50
these three ways. Okay. So proper organization ensures consistency. Um in
30:56
the beginning I know guys this sounds boring and this is like why do I need to
30:59
do this? Let me just you know get to the ads part and start spending money. Um
31:02
but the small things matter. So you know take this seriously um and make sure
31:07
that you organize it in a nice way so that you know exactly what you're doing
31:10
because a lot of the times even we get confused what was the font what was the
31:13
color palette but if you have it organized you know what to do
31:17
here's how the AI branding workflow works you generate your brand name using
31:22
you know tools like namelics you design your logo concept using tools like
31:26
midjourney looker canva and then you create a color palette using coolers
31:30
chroma or even pinterest um and this is what the workflow for
31:35
you know your branding looks like. Um and the second part of it is generating
31:40
branded copy building your store using tools like um you know the ones I
31:45
mentioned like gem pages and you got other ones also like durable AI and
31:49
stuff like that but I would say Gem Pages and Atlas are the two main ones
31:52
and then you create your visuals using midjourney sora runway for ad creatives.
31:56
So everything again like you saw we're making AI do the heavy lifting and doing
32:01
a lot less work um in in in significance. Um and yeah the the Canva
32:09
brand kit to lock your chosen fonts and then you have AI and you add it with
32:13
your brand kit and that's branding done for you. Okay so here's a quick rep
32:18
recap. You have your foundation uh which builds trust. You have originality which
32:23
ensures uniqueness with Google domain checks and trademarks. You have an AI
32:27
advantage because you're using AI to do the heavy lifting. And then you have
32:31
your essentials like your name, colors, logo, imagery, your evolution so that
32:35
you keep compounding over your branding. And then most importantly, uh you have
32:39
your organization. So how do you kind of place all these things in one single
32:44
folder so that you can firstly be clear yourself and then also pass it on to
32:48
your uh team members, your future hires or your virtual assistants depending on
32:54
um you know who you choose to work with. Uh but yeah guys that's it for today.
32:58
Hope you guys liked it um and got some value. So yeah thank you.
33:06
So I think if you have any questions just like yeah I can go one by one and
33:10
then So this is for Dubai or where?
33:32
Um yeah, I think your company certificate is enough.
33:37
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I haven't really, Last I
33:59
checked, I believe Ted was doing it for you guys. So, I haven't really Maybe
34:03
I'll circle back with them, understand what's up, and then get back to you on
34:06
that. Yeah, that's it.
34:12
Okay. Okay, guys. questions anyone? Okay. Yeah.
34:25
What structure? Um like again that that's a big huge
34:31
discussion but like give me a specific what do you mean by structure?
34:37
Um, one campaign, 10 adsets, single interest
34:42
per adset, three ads per adset. So, 30 ads.
34:48
I go single interest. Yeah. Cool.
35:12
process. I mean, those things you've mentioned
35:19
are like a must. So, you can't really Yeah. So, you have to do do those. In
35:23
the meantime, we're trying to build out our website. We're trying to create the
35:26
ads probably. uh we're trying to post some organic content while we have all
35:30
the company stuff going on. So the moment we get the company, we get the
35:34
PayPal, we're not wasting any time. We launch like right there and then. So in
35:38
the meantime, we sort all of this out like you know, finding your suppliers,
35:42
getting your products reviewed, building your landing pages. Um maybe before you
35:47
get your company, all of your 10 landing pages or your 10 products product pages
35:50
are done. Your ads are done. So now you just go full force.
35:58
Yeah. Like what? What kind of replica?
36:25
Yeah. I mean like it's it's probably not the best practice because you could get
36:28
into some trouble legally and also um with your payment processing with your
36:34
Facebook ads every step of the way you will face some issue. Of course. Now,
36:39
again, off the record, there are ways to game it, but like I I just don't think
36:42
it's worth the hassle because if you really want to crack this and you want
36:46
to crack this the right way, um then you want to sell something that you kind of
36:50
got, you kind of marketed because selling replicas is like relatively
36:54
easier because again there's there's something which is you're selling you're
36:58
basically selling an already existing brand but in a replic, right?
37:05
Cool. Why don't you run it through me after
37:26
class and maybe I can have a look at it? Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough.
37:31
Cool. Guys, any more questions? Yeah. Okay.
37:47
You'll have to you'll have to ask him. I mean, honestly, a contract in China
37:51
doesn't mean much. Uh so, I mean, you can kind of skip through the contract
37:54
part at least now. Um and I feel like he will have a um a custom tool of his own
38:00
which he's going to integrate into your Shopify store. So the moment you get an
38:03
order, he gets to know and then he ships it out. You have to figure out from him
38:07
how will you pay him? Yeah.
38:12
Perfect. How how was the pricing different though? How how much? How
38:15
much? Okay. So half the price. That's pretty
38:19
cool. Pretty cool. Cool guys. If no more questions then we
38:25
can Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thank you. Thank
38:29
you guys. See you next time.
Branding & Shopify Setup
16/09/2025 | 12:00 PM - 01:30 PM
Mr. Ishan Suri
0:27
Goodbye. Are we all done at scanning?
0:45
All done. I'm taking it down. So, we done with the dentist.
1:10
Yes. Cool.
1:48

2:02
Hey guys. Good afternoon everyone. How's everyone doing?
2:06
Good. Awesome. So, I'm sure all of you have
2:11
started building your Shopify website by now, right? How many of you have Okay.
2:14
No. Okay. Cool. How many of you have finished building your website?
2:20
Okay. We've got a few. Um a lot of the things uh you guys might
2:25
know but I still I'm going to cover today's session which is um
2:30
okay this is off. Okay, cool.
2:50
Right. So, okay. How many of you have seen the dashboard and interacted with
2:55
all the options on the left over here? You can see orders, products, customers.
3:01
Have you guys seen this, opened it? Yeah.
3:04
Yeah. Cool. um any section that you think was confusing, you didn't
3:08
understand, um something you have any questions on.
3:13
Cool. So yeah, this is how a normal dashboard looks. Um you have your
3:17
orders, you have your products, your customers, your marketing. If you want
3:20
to set up any discounts, you have discounts also over here. And most
3:24
importantly, the most I think the most important uh tab after orders of course
3:28
is your analytics. So this is where all the data is there for you to read. Um,
3:36
now about navigating your Shopify dashboard,
3:42
you want to create and edit and organize product into collections. So, this is
3:47
one collection that I usually have on my website always, which is bestsellers.
3:51
Um, there's another collection that I have regardless of which niche my
3:55
website or my store is in. What do you think that guy is? Another collection
3:58
that I like putting into websites. Any any guesses?
4:03
So, new arrivals. I always like having new arrivals because even though they're
4:07
not new arrivals, but it kind of invokes some level of curiosity with my customer
4:12
into what's new and and I like having bestsellers and new arrivals. You can
4:16
jumble it up and have multiple products uh on your website uh this way. Now, um
4:23
discounts. I showed you guys discounts on how you can create discounts. Uh the
4:27
cool thing about discounts is you can set up multiple kinds of discounts. For
4:30
example, you can say um shop for more than $50 and get free shipping. So
4:36
that's a discount, right? Um shop two products, get 10% off. Discounts are not
4:41
always flat in terms of percentage, but also you can get creative with setting
4:45
up your discounts and you can actually test these discounts yourself uh inside
4:49
your dashboard. Now we spoke about Atlas AI guys, which is your AI store builder.
4:53
Um this is how it usually works. So step one, whichever product you guys have
4:58
will either be in Shopify, AliExpress, Amazon or Alibaba. All you have to do is
5:04
copy that link and paste it right here and then click on generate store and in
5:10
the next 30 seconds it's going to build the website for you. Um, this is how the
5:15
website kind of looks like. It's pretty clean. Um, and you know, you have your
5:18
product photos, uh, you have your sections and everything done for you in
5:23
like less than 60 seconds. Uh it also has like AI photos for you. So like this
5:27
is a before image of your product and that would be an after image and this is
5:32
something that it does on its own. Um again this is not perfect but it's
5:36
something you can work with. Correct. The next thing is product bundles. It
5:41
also builds product bundles. So like let's say buy one you get this price,
5:45
buy two you get a certain price and buy three you get a certain price. Another
5:49
thing if you guys can see over here is this check box which says insured
5:54
shipping and delivery for $3. Um if you do the math like even if you
6:00
charge insured shipping and delivery and by the way people can deselect this but
6:05
even if you charge $3 an order if you're doing $100 $100 a day that's an extra um
6:11
revenue for you. Uh it doesn't sound like a lot, but when you are doing when
6:15
you're running at scale, even a few dollars added to your bottom line will
6:19
help. And this is pure profit. So if you're doing $10 uh 10 orders a day,
6:23
you're making $30 profit a day doing nothing just by having a insured
6:28
shipping and delivery, which basically means that if the product is lost, you
6:32
will refund the customer. But guess what? If it gets lost, you would anyway
6:36
have to refund the customer. So it's like this is just money on the table
6:39
that you can kind of get. Um you can also customize each section
6:44
with Atlas AI. So for example like this is a section which is like why are we
6:49
better than the other competitors in the market. So I really like this section.
6:53
This is just one of the sections it gives you. So pretty simple stuff in
6:56
terms of uh how do you build your website.
7:00
Now the next one is gem pages. Now this is the next tool you want to use to
7:04
build your website. If you want to build something which is extremely branded,
7:10
you want something which is uh very customizable, you want to drag and drop
7:14
things, different layouts, um this is when I would use gem pages. You can also
7:20
build high converting funnels here which basically means that um let's say
7:24
someone is checking out from your website, you can actually sell them
7:28
something which is which is an upsell. Guys, can I just over there at the back?
7:34
Yeah. Can we please keep quiet? Thank you. Um, so if here's your checkout
7:38
page, when the person is checking out, you can have a pop-up which says, "Hey,
7:42
do you want to get this product too for 50% off?" This is the way of increasing
7:46
your average order value. There's also a thank you page. So, when they place an
7:50
order, they see a thank you page. And this is called a post purchase upsell,
7:54
which basically means that even after they've bought from you, you can sell
7:57
them something else. Um, we make 20% of our monthly revenue through this upsell
8:02
because once they've bought from us, they already trust us. they've bought
8:05
something and then I can just go and say, "Hey, get this product too for 50%
8:09
off." So, I give them this crazy discount which is very hard to say no
8:12
to. And the fact that they already like us because they've bought from us
8:16
increases our chances of um you know, so I have a 50% take rate on this upsell.
8:23
Again, I'll explain. Once they buy from us, they see the thank you page and on
8:26
the thank you page, I give them this crazy discount on a few products and I
8:30
ask them to buy again and 50% of the people buy again. So I think this works
8:35
pretty well too. Um then you can tailor your store to perfection. You can
8:39
basically see different layouts. You can essentially see uh drag and drop and
8:44
create the website the way you want. Most of you people are building your
8:49
website on Shopify right now and it has certain limitations. You can't drag and
8:53
drop things. You can't edit things the way you want. But in Gem Pages, this is
8:57
goes out of the window because you could do anything. It integrates with all your
9:00
apps, which basically means that you can, you know, whatever apps you're
9:04
using, you can just stick it on the gem pages and you can just select a section.
9:08
It's as simple as dragging and dropping. Um, another cool thing is you get
9:13
already wellressearched templates which are supposed to do well based on your
9:17
niche. So, let's say if you're selling something uh if you're selling a shoe,
9:21
you'd probably get a pre-made template and all you have to do is just select
9:24
that template and just change the images and of course the title and some of the
9:29
things and you already have your uh landing page ready which is pretty
9:32
simple. So, I've been using Gem Pages for the last 3 to four years and it's
9:36
been super helpful for us to look like a micro branded store because essentially
9:40
Shopify is not going to allow you to do that because of its lack of
9:44
customization. Um, again,
9:49
here are some themes. So, before you start building your Shopify store, you
9:53
would have to select a theme. You don't have to pay for a theme because there
9:57
are some paid themes, but you also have very popular free theme. So, you could
10:01
go for a free theme below, the ones you see over here, or you could even design
10:06
your store using AI. So, all you have to do is just write a prompt. So, for
10:10
example, there's a prompt over here which says, "A store specializing in
10:13
stylish and comfortable loungewear for women." And it's gone ahead and
10:18
basically built out a theme for us without us doing any work. So, you can
10:22
also kind of um you know use the free themes or you could just prompt a theme
10:26
for your business. Uh both are pretty simple. Now,
10:30
this is the footer section of your website. Um, for the people who built
10:35
their website for now, how many of you have any of these policies that you see
10:40
over here? Okay, you have all of them. Which ones?
10:53
I use but also Okay, cool. So, yeah, these are super
11:01
important for two reasons. is one, it protects you legally. Um, so any legal
11:05
implications are protected by the policies. And number two, for you to get
11:09
your payment processing, you would need these policies in place. So this is the
11:13
footer section of your website, which is literally the bottom section. And you
11:17
want to have your main menu, which is home, shop, contact us. Then you have a
11:21
bunch of policies, which is shipping, uh, refund, return, privacy policy, and
11:26
terms of service. And then you want to have a get in touch section which is
11:29
essentially the company and then you know uh your opening times and your
11:33
number. Here is what I was talking about yesterday I think which is all your
11:36
payment badges. Uh if you can see you have PayPal, Visa, Mastercard. These
11:41
work as trust builders and you will automatically get these once you get
11:46
your payment processing. So the moment you attach your payment processing to
11:48
your website you're going to get these options. Um but this adds trust to your
11:53
website. We spoke a lot about trust yesterday and having these payment
11:57
processing badges below uh makes your customer trust you because they don't
12:02
maybe trust you but they do trust these uh brands because they're well known. Um
12:06
so yeah this is what you have to kind of get into your footer section
12:10
and here is the section on top. So here you could have like a homepage of course
12:15
you have a f FAQs, contact us and if you have any products uh you should have
12:21
them over here. You also have this banner on top which I think is good
12:25
space to use for your marketing. Now I don't really like the banner over here
12:29
because all it says is huge savings now plus free shipping. How do you think we
12:34
we can make this more engaging? Uh maybe create some urgency. What could we write
12:39
on top of the banner? Because guess what? This is again above the fold. The
12:42
moment they land they will see this banner on top. So what do you think we
12:47
Sorry. Yeah. Okay. So flashy, but I'm talking
12:50
also about like what text could we have? Like what could we literally write here
12:55
that could make it easier for? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But like frame
12:59
something for me. Okay. So you're saying offers basically
13:04
writing offers. But you could have Yeah. Exactly. But this is very vague. It says
13:07
huge savings. Now what is huge? And then it says free shipping. Um I would say
13:12
something more like um you know spend more than $50 and get free shipping. And
13:18
I would have a banner like this kind of a bar on top that if let's say they
13:22
spend 40, it's it would say $10 more spend and you get free shipping. So it's
13:26
kind of like creating that urgency for them to spend more and therefore
13:30
increase the AOV and then get free shipping because I have no clue how I
13:34
get free shipping with what it says over here. So it's a very small area on your
13:38
website, but I think it holds decent value. So just use it really well and
13:42
create urgency. Write your offer. I'm not saying you have to use the one I
13:46
just told you, but it should be used in the right way and it shouldn't be vague.
13:55
All right. So, now we're going to be talking about some Shopify settings. To
14:00
activate your payment methods, um you have to basically go to your uh Shopify
14:05
settings, payment methods, and then activate Shopify or PayPal from there.
14:09
Now again, this is going to happen once you get your processing in place.
14:12
Otherwise, it won't um if you want to add any of your team members or people
14:17
that work with you, then you need to add them from the user permission setting.
14:21
You can just go there and add anyone with their email. Um and then during
14:24
checkout, you want to enable email and SMS notifications.
14:29
Why do you guys think we should enable email and SMS from here?
14:33
Customer base. Sorry,
14:35
customer base. Okay. I mean the C the moment they
14:39
entered their email you already have them in your customer base.
14:46
Okay. Sorry.
14:49
Yeah. So essentially when you enable email and SMS you the moment it happens
14:53
is he enters the email and he abandons the cart. So then an email goes out to
14:58
him saying hey you left this in your cart like what was the problem? Come
15:01
back buy from us. Then the second email goes out and says hey here's a 10% off.
15:05
we really want you to, you know, so here this is where the communication happens
15:10
to get the customer back and of course give them notifications about their
15:14
order if they've placed an order from us. So you need to enable that from your
15:17
checkout option. This is not done uh like your stores don't have this enabled
15:21
right now. So you have to go and enable it yourself.
15:24
Now shipping is where guys a lot of the money can be made and let me explain
15:29
how. So firstly we charge shipping usually. So, let's say if I go standard
15:34
shipping for $5, I would go fasttrack shipping for $9.99 and then I would go
15:39
fast and insured shipping for $14.95. So, essentially, I've made three
15:47
brackets of shipping and I'm charging $5 more for each section, right? Um because
15:54
most people have free track shipping. you. But again, I'm only giving free
15:58
track shipping when when someone shops for more than $50, for example. Right?
16:02
So, you only get free shipping when you hit a certain threshold of spending
16:06
money. And then after that, if you don't, then I'm going to be charging
16:09
you. If you want your um packet insured, I charge more. If you want your package
16:14
faster, I charge more. Like, we've earned tens of thousands of dollars just
16:18
through shipping. Forget the product because anything you charge on shipping
16:22
is basically free money, right? So, you got to be smart with getting money out
16:26
of each step, which is again the shipping over here. Um, you have to set
16:29
up local taxes and compliances if you're selling in the US specifically. I'm
16:34
going to get to that. Um, then again, use your domains. I think um
16:39
have all of you bought your domains by now.
16:43
Okay, cool. Like what domains are you using? Like is it com? Is it a
16:48
Yeah. So, okay. If you get a com that is good, but if you don't get a como fine.
16:52
You want to go for something which is uh but don't definitely use the Shopify
16:56
domain. I had someone asking me in the last batch that is that fine don't go
16:59
for a Shopify domain for sure that looks very unprofessional. Um now setting up
17:04
sales tax in the beginning just use chat GPT to understand regional sales tax
17:09
threshold. So in the US every state has a different sales tax and let's say if
17:14
you spend a certain amount in California then you after that amount you've got to
17:19
pay start paying sales tax. Everything is different. In the beginning, you
17:23
don't need to probably worry about this, but eventually once you pass a certain
17:26
threshold of sales, you will have to um you also have to register for sales tax
17:32
once you pass the threshold. So, it's not just like I just because I pass the
17:35
threshold, I start paying it. I also have to register for it. But again, this
17:38
is something for the long run, but it's my job to tell you guys right now um to
17:42
know when you are supposed to pass that threshold. Now, most people charge
17:47
inclusive pricing, which is essentially your price of the product includes taxes
17:52
because I feel like when you say here's the price plus tax, it puts people off.
17:57
So, don't do that. Just go for inclusive pricing. Uh even when it comes to
18:01
taxation, right? Um again, for sales tax guys, you don't
18:08
have to worry about it right now, but it is important to plan as your sales grow.
18:12
So even before you start, you should know about every sales tax bracket so
18:16
that you know once I surpass this um then I'm going to start paying it. Just
18:21
for context, I don't think for the first $40 $50,000 you're going to be begging
18:24
any sales tax, but eventually and what you have to understand is like even if
18:28
you get $50,000 in sales is probably going to be spread out spread out across
18:32
multiple countries. Um this really applies in the US specifically. So yeah,
18:37
just for context and then eventually you want to have professional advice on
18:42
board and have an accountant which you can find on Upwork. Get on a
18:46
consultation call just understand from them what the implications are. Um but
18:49
this is again for the future you don't have anything right now. Again we spoke
18:53
about shipping options. Um so firstly you got to understand your product um
18:58
weight. Oops. Sorry. Yeah. So you got to understand your
19:12
product weight which is essentially um you don't have to track weight u in the
19:19
beginning but what I would say that eventually you want to track weight even
19:22
if it seems unimportant right now because let me explain how shipping
19:25
works. So let's say if your product is below 500 grams then you are in a
19:29
certain slab of pricing. the moment you even go five grams above 500 grams, you
19:34
come into a different slab of pricing. So you need to know how much product
19:37
weighs because if you you want to idly be under that 500 gram slot, if you go
19:41
more, you pay more. So that's why tracking your weight is super important.
19:46
Um and eventually when you go private labeling, let's say when you order or a
19:50
lot of pieces, then you need to know what each of your product weighs. So
19:55
that let's say if I'm ordering 10 products, what should the entire weight
19:58
be? and based on that I'm going to be charged shipping. Um, you'll be
20:02
surprised that sometimes your shipping cost will be three times more than your
20:06
actual product cost. Okay? And this is how it works. It's it's pretty that's
20:10
just how it is when it when it comes into Chinese drop shipping. Like so you
20:13
need to know what your weight is per se. Now the next thing is um the way you can
20:20
set up your shipping is going by shipping setup in your Shopify settings.
20:23
Um shipping and delivery. You'll see this option. Um you can apply a general
20:28
shipping rate for worldwide but you have to set up shipping for each country
20:32
which basically means the US will have different shipping the Australia will
20:36
have different shipping Canada and separately for each state or sorry each
20:39
country you would have different shipping and the reason for this is
20:42
because the pricing that your supplier will give you for each country is going
20:47
to be different. So let's say if he charges me more for Australia I have to
20:50
charge the customer more for Australia. If he charges me lesser for the UK I
20:53
charge the customer lesser. So depending on what your supplier charges you, you
20:57
have to set up the shipping from the back end. Very important because if you
21:01
don't do this, let's say if you didn't set up shipping for Canada, you get a
21:04
Canadian customer, he goes to check out, he wants to buy, he sees nothing, he
21:07
cannot check out because you didn't set this up. So a lot of people miss this
21:11
out, but it's pretty important. And like I said, create custom rates for each
21:16
shipping option so that when they want to check out, they can.
21:20
Um yeah, like the way you set shipping costs, you can do it based on weight,
21:25
but I just like a flat rate, like five bucks, 10 bucks, just go flat rate. Uh
21:30
and then again decide um a lot of you are going to be selling in
21:35
different countries. So just understand from your scope that if I'm shipping
21:39
worldwide, can I handle that shipping? If I just want to go for a few uh
21:43
countries, what do I need to set up? Because the complexity will be different
21:47
for each region. Can your supplier even ship there? So that's something you need
21:50
to ask them. Um but I would say keep it simple. Don't ship to more than four or
21:54
five countries in the beginning. Um and again like I said shipping options
21:58
standard, express free insured. You want to be charging different for shipping.
22:03
Also this is literally free money on the table. And make sure that you kind of
22:06
like uh make use of that. Um incentivize free shipping by people spending more.
22:12
The rule of thumb is if your product is for like let's say $30 then you want to
22:16
be charging more free shipping after 50. But let's say if your product is worth
22:20
70 then I would go free shipping over 100 bucks. So it really depends on what
22:23
your product price is based on which I will set a barrier of free shipping
22:28
above a certain point. Now setting up your first product the
22:33
first important thing is of course highquality images because as you know
22:37
above the fold which is what they see first the image is the only thing that
22:41
they're going to be noticing. So your first image is super important. So you
22:44
got to be using high quality uniform images. even your aspect ratio. Like if
22:48
something is a square, the next thing can't be a rectangle. It looks odd. So
22:51
make sure your aspect ratio is the same. Um what's the rule of pricing for a
22:56
product? Like how much do we decide? Yeah. Okay.
23:01
3x the pricing. But also another thing you have to keep in mind is what is the
23:05
competition pricing it at? So if my competition is pricing it at 2.9 then or
23:09
2.7 then I want to be around that mark. I don't want to be overshooting it in
23:13
the beginning. I can improve my pricing as we start getting sales. Maybe there's
23:18
a possibility that he's charging 5x. So then why should I go 3x, right? Like you
23:23
so you have to look at competition before you price. And then again, this
23:29
part is pretty important. SEO. So for example, if your product is um you know
23:34
a heat like it's a it's a back massager. I would never name my product my brand
23:39
name and back massager because what's going to happen is people are going to
23:42
use the keyword back massager and go on Amazon and Google and they will find the
23:47
same product. So I don't want to name it a back massager. What I would do is I
23:51
would name it like I don't know like if it's a head massager for example I would
23:55
call it the relaxation spa kit or the relaxation spa because when they go on
23:59
Amazon and they try and search for that they're not going to find anything. Or
24:03
if they go on Google and they search for that they're not going to find anything.
24:05
So you never never use the actual keyword of your product as your product
24:09
title. Okay? Never even just just call it like let's say if your brand name is
24:14
X so you call it X relaxiation spark kit like that would be the name of your
24:18
product rather than just calling it a massager or a toy or a whatever like do
24:24
not use keywords and that's how you convince the guy that okay when he goes
24:28
and searches it anywhere else he doesn't find anything then he comes back to your
24:31
own website and he buys from you because then he believes it's your product right
24:34
so this is a little hack that I use each time and the surprising thing is when
24:39
you scale you will go on Amazon and you will see like people searching for your
24:42
own brand name with that thing and they don't find anything like you know how
24:45
you get like a drop down of what the most recent search keywords were and of
24:49
course when you search it you don't find anything so this is something that I
24:52
keep using each time and it works even now um in terms of creating highquality
24:57
images using AI here are the seven tools that I use and
25:03
essentially each tool is for different um images that I want so for example if
25:08
I want studio quality consistent product shots I'm using something like Clyde AI.
25:13
Okay. If I want something with realistic lifestyle environments, I'm going for
25:17
Flare. Um if I want something which is um text to image, like the the last two
25:22
is something I use a lot which is Midjourney and Sora AI. Um but again,
25:26
I've given you like seven tools you guys can use to make sure that you get the
25:30
right product image in place and a bunch of them correct. So you can just I don't
25:35
know, take a picture. Of course, you're going to get access to this so you'll
25:38
get an idea of which ones to use. Um, usually what I like doing is I take the
25:42
picture that I've got from the supplier and then I upload that picture onto
25:47
these tools and I give it the right prompts to get the final picture that I
25:50
want. And I've told you guys this like 10 times that the main picture is super
25:55
important. So the hero image right now creating the ideal website guys. Um,
26:00
here's the structure. Focus on high quality images and clear call to action
26:04
buttons. Um, now we all know that a shop now or a buy
26:09
now is a call to action, but I like having multiple call to actions on my
26:14
product page. So, let me guys ask let me ask you this. What other call to actions
26:18
can we put on our website to make the guy go on to the next step which is
26:22
maybe adding to card or, you know, checking out another call to action.
26:30
Sorry. Okay. But like if he's on the product
26:34
page and we say learn more about then like where does he go to learn more like
26:37
he he's only there. So usually what I like to do here is
26:42
like I can't keep saying yeah limited time.
26:45
Okay. So okay urgency CTA. Fair enough. What I like try doing is like let's say
26:49
if I say shop now after every section on my website I would have another CTA and
26:54
I would say something like um you know feel like you're floating on CL clouds
26:59
today and that would be my CTA. So my call to action now is not the actual
27:03
offer or shop now. It's the feeling I'm trying to sell. Like what do you feel
27:08
after buying my product is the call to action. So I would have multiple call to
27:13
actions based on what the feeling I'm trying to basically pass on to the
27:16
customer. Right? Um I'm going to share an app with you guys tomorrow. Uh how
27:21
many of you have heard of uh heat maps? Okay.
27:27
Yeah. So, so what is a heat map?
27:40
Yeah. Yeah. So guys, what a heat map is is once you see your own website, you're
27:45
going to see sections of your website which are red and some sections will be
27:49
yellow and then some sections will be green. It'll be like a complete thing.
27:52
Okay, I'll I'll show you tomorrow. The red sections are where your customers
27:55
spend the most time. something. So yeah, the the red is going
28:01
to be where your customers spend the most time. So essentially if I if I see
28:06
and I'm also going to give you an app where you can actually see the screen
28:09
recording of each of your customer session. So it's literally like having
28:13
POV and having eyes on your customer on how they're shopping. So about the heat
28:17
map, if you know that okay, this section like let's say they scroll down and they
28:20
were spending time at a certain section, it's going to be red, which means they
28:24
spent the most of the time here. That tells me that they liked what they saw
28:27
over here and therefore I should maybe bring it up. And if there's something on
28:31
top, which is like if there's a lot of green on your first product image, that
28:35
means they don't like it. They didn't spend time here. They're bouncing off.
28:37
And then the yellow is where I'm they they spent a decent amount of time. So
28:42
what I'm going to do is look for the reds and get them up on top and
28:46
basically segment them in a way where the reds are on top. The greens I'm
28:49
going to basically remove from my landing page because again, they don't
28:52
like that. And like I said, you're going to get a screen recording of each of
28:56
your session. So you're going to know exactly their IP address, their country,
28:59
and then you can literally press play and you can see what they did on your
29:02
website. Like literally like a POV of how where they went, where they clicked
29:06
on, how much time they spend on each section. And that way you will actually
29:11
understand the pain points of your customer because if most of your
29:14
customers are coming on your website, not even scrolling down, you know,
29:16
you're above the fold. It's screwed. You've got to work on that, right? So,
29:19
I'm going to share those apps tomorrow and you guys can use it on your website
29:22
and that way you can actually know exactly what they like, what they don't
29:26
like, and do more of what they like and do less of what they don't. So, um I
29:30
think this is a good perspective on how you can actually get feedback from your
29:35
customer without even actually speaking to them, which I think is pretty cool.
29:39
Um, now the next thing, we spoke about this
29:44
yesterday, but I'm reiterating adding trust and social proof on every part of
29:50
your website. So, be it testimonials, reviews, you want to be adding these
29:54
reviews at every end to build trust. Um, social proof, so having influencers or
30:00
yourself talking about the product, putting that in every part of your
30:04
website. It could be videos, it could be um just images, it could be anything.
30:08
But essentially, social proof is what makes people trust you and therefore
30:12
they can buy from you, right? And again, the last thing that I spoke about
30:15
strategic placement. So you want to position these things based on because
30:19
even if you have three customer testimonials, maybe they liked one, they
30:22
didn't like one. So how do you know which to place where? The heat map's
30:25
going to tell you, the recording is going to tell you, and based on whatever
30:27
they like, we kind of position things. And we want the ones which people like
30:33
to be more prominent compared to the ones that people didn't. So again,
30:36
strategic placement is super important. It's not what you put, it's where do you
30:40
put it, right? And that's what you have to understand from the customer's lens,
30:44
which is going to help you u help them convert these people. Now, we spoke
30:48
about color palettes and typography. So I'm not going to go through this. We
30:51
covered this completely yesterday. So, I'm going to skip this part. If you guys
30:54
have any questions, let me know. But I think it's pretty clear. Um, and then
30:58
again, theme limitations. So, every time you set up your theme or you set up your
31:02
website, you would need a theme. I would say go for a um free one. Don't go for a
31:06
paid one. And uh you don't need any custom coding to differentiate because
31:10
most of you don't know how to code here, which is completely fine. That's why I
31:13
give you gem pages because over there there's no coding. It's drag and drop
31:16
and you can build whatever you want. You want to self test. So, you want to buy
31:20
from your own website uh before you start running ads, place a test
31:24
purchase. What you could do is set up a um 100% discount code like Tedar and
31:29
then just go to check out, get the 100% discount and place the order um without
31:33
actually spending again. I mean, it's your website, so you would probably get
31:36
the refund, but I'm just saying this is a good way of testing the product.
31:40
And here are the final checks for your Shopify website. Um again, you have your
31:45
main menu and navigation, which is the one on top. So the banner, uh the
31:49
homepage, the FAQs, contact us. Make sure you have all of these ready. Um the
31:54
next thing is your checkout process. So simulate a customer journey to identify
32:00
any issues during the buying process. So go through the entire process of getting
32:03
on your product page, adding the cart, checking out, doing the whole thing
32:06
yourself and seeing if you have um you know any friction over there and can you
32:12
fix it. And then of course your shipping options. Ensure shipping options are
32:16
correctly set up and displayed at checkout. If I'm someone buying from
32:19
Dubai and I don't have the Dubai shipping is not set up by you, then I
32:23
will not see that option and therefore I cannot buy it from uh and I can't check
32:26
out. So make sure you do it for every region you set it for. So usually the
32:30
way I like doing it, I set up a worldwide shipping and then I set up the
32:33
shipping specifically for the regions I'm targeting. So maybe I get a customer
32:37
from Spain for example. I'm not targeting Spain, but I get Spain and
32:40
then he wants to check out. So I don't want to set up a shipping for like the
32:44
hundred odd countries out there, right? But I set up a worldwide shipping for
32:47
everything else and then I set up a shipping for just the customers that are
32:51
uh that are being targeted by my Facebook ads. Um again, payment testing.
32:55
You can test payments with 100% discount code. So check your PayPal, check your
32:59
Stripe whenever you get access to these tools. Um you know, but you will have to
33:03
test them. And then confirm that all your products are set to active. So the
33:08
moment you create a product, what you're going to be seeing is that they're going
33:12
to be in the draft space. So you want to change from draft to active, and that's
33:16
the only way uh they become active on your websites. And you want them
33:21
published across relevant sales channels, which basically means that if
33:25
you don't have your product added to the homepage section or the homepage sales
33:30
channel, it won't show up on your homepage. So if you want it to show up
33:33
on your homepage, you have to add it to the relevant sales channel, which is uh
33:37
what you have to do. So cool guys, I think yeah, what was your number? I
33:41
think the takeaway from this session because I feel like a lot of you have
33:43
already done the Shopify part. Anything that you learned new today that you
33:47
think you're going to be uh kind of implementing into your website?
33:58
Okay. like subway to very easily. So I think
34:03
that's a very good idea and I think I'm going to try to see how it
34:09
fits with my Okay, cool. Anyone else? Anything that
34:14
you think was a takeaway from this session and that you're going to
34:17
implement today? Yeah.
34:26
idea. Yeah. So like charge more for each
34:36
shipping bracket, right? Cool. Anyone else? Yeah.
34:42
Sorry. The taxes. Yeah.
34:46
Okay. Cool. No worries. Yeah. Yeah. But not not not right now.
34:53
But eventually you would have to. But like
34:56
right now uh just just uh just say charge no tax
35:02
because your price is inclusive of tax. Yeah. Yeah.
35:16
Can you use gem pages to edit an already existing page?
35:19
No, you have to build it on their own. Uh, yeah.
35:28
What if you don't have social proof? I just make it up.
35:33
Yeah. That I mean, fa fake it a bit till you make it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
35:40
Okay, guys. Any any more questions, takeaways?
35:45
Okay, good. Okay, cool guys. Thank you today. Thank
35:50
you. Hope you got some. Thank you. Hello.
35:56
Hi. I have one question.
36:00
For example, we don't have a supplier.



Suppliers & Fulfillment
17/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
 Mr. Ishan Suri
2:41
It was this one. Either way.
6:04
Where are you going? Nope.
6:09
Sit. What's your name?
6:12
Okay. Is there any BMD folk who is not who has
6:17
not been able to sign their attendance? Do it now. This is only up for 10
6:22
seconds. Take it down.
6:30
Take all attendance. Can we all settle down? We're going to
7:25
start class. Can we close the door? Good morning.
7:38
Good morning. Let's start.
7:46
Okay. Good morning, guys. Today's one's going to be pretty short
7:51
uh because we're just going to go through the apps that I've been telling
7:54
you this entire time. So, yeah, just um the apps you guys are going to be using
7:59
on your website. So, yeah, let's let's begin. I think um the first one is this
8:04
called uh this app called Vitals. The reason I like this a lot is because this
8:09
app has 40 apps in one. So, I could have given you like a bunch of apps, but
8:14
instead of like just paying separately for each app, you can go buy this app,
8:20
which is essentially you pay um I I've added the link, and I think they were
8:23
they have a 10% off discount. Uh but the cool thing is that they have 40 apps in
8:27
one, and I'm going to go through most of them right now. Um so, again, here are
8:32
some of the apps they have. Okay, starting off, they have product reviews.
8:36
So, you know, the Amazon kind of reviews you get at the end of the product page
8:39
which shows um it in a very native way that someone's left reviews on your
8:44
website. Um you have product reviews and again you can kind of add your own
8:48
reviews onto this if you don't have some in the beginning. Uh goes without
8:51
saying. Um they have an upsell builder which is essentially if you want to
8:54
create any upsell or cross-ell um they have an app for that. Um they have
8:59
product bundles. So if you want to sell product A with product B um you get
9:03
product bundles. you get volume discounts which is essentially buy one
9:08
uh buy two get 10% off buy three get 20% off and you kind of see that on websites
9:13
right so that's what they have also have they also have a spending goal I think I
9:18
spoke about this yesterday um where like if someone spends x amount then you can
9:23
incentivize them by giving them a discount or you can give them free um
9:27
free shipping now the next thing is um a gift you want
9:33
to give people a gift um right um for something that they've done. So you can
9:38
also give them a gift. Um I spoke about post purchase upsell. I think some of
9:43
you guys weren't there. What is a post purchase upsell?
9:47
Anyone? Yeah, exactly. So like it says post
9:56
purchase upsell is basically selling them something after they've already
9:59
bought from you. So, let's say they place an order and it says, "Thank you
10:02
for ordering from us." And then the pop-up comes and says, "Hey, like by the
10:05
way, would you like this?" And in the post-purchase upsell, I I usually like
10:10
offering like a crazy discount. So, I give them like a 50% off because I
10:14
already know they trust me. They just bought from me. Their buyer intent is
10:17
super high, so why not make them buy again? Now, why can I give them 50% off?
10:21
Because I'm not spending on ads anymore so that I have a high margin, so I can
10:24
give them a crazy discount. And um the take rate on this is super high, you
10:29
know, and it works better if you have a product which people want more than one.
10:33
So it's not like, you know what I mean? Like if it's a pair of socks, t-shirts,
10:36
I don't know, it could be anything that people want more than one. This works
10:39
really well there. Now, this is what I spoke about yesterday, visitor replays.
10:43
So you get screen recordings of each session of your customer. All you have
10:47
to do is just switch this on and every customer who comes onto your website,
10:51
you can play his recording. Um, you can see his IP address, his uh country,
10:55
everything. And you can literally see the way he's shopping, like his POV on
11:00
how he's shopping. So, this is pretty cool. Um, then you have sticky add
11:04
toart. Have you guys heard of this sticky add to cardart?
11:08
So, basically, you know, when you uh scroll on the website, you see one add
11:11
to cardart, but when you pass that add to cardart, there's a sticky add to
11:15
cardart at the bottom of your screen, which keeps staying there even when you
11:18
scroll down. Does that make sense? Yeah. So, there's an add. So, let's say
11:22
there's an add to cart. You scroll down. There's no more add to cart, but there's
11:25
an add to cart here, which is like sticking to the screen and it stays
11:29
there the entire time. The cool thing about that is because if you want
11:31
someone to add to cart way below, they don't have to scroll all the way up. So,
11:34
that's why it's called a sticky add to cardart. And then you've got a currency
11:38
converter. So what this does is let's say someone logs in from Australia, it
11:42
automatically tracks their IP and changes the currency from USD to AUD or
11:47
pounds depending on let's say you can also set this up. Um so these are just
11:52
10. Here are some more. I'm probably not going to go through all of them, but
11:56
I'll try and go through most. Um um there's a scroll to top button. Let's
12:01
say someone's way down on your website on your product page. All they do is
12:04
click on that, they come up. Um you know the product description tabs. I told you
12:07
about the tabs where you um you click on the tab and there's a drop down so it
12:12
doesn't take too much space on your website but at the same time um you can
12:15
have that there's best sellers protection so you know how people I
12:18
don't know if you know this but like you can spy on your competitor's best
12:21
sellers and what this does is it just hides that from them um it's basically
12:27
that like it just hides your best sellers and there's also content
12:30
protection let's say someone comes on your website he likes what you written
12:33
on your product page he just does a command copy and tries to paste it on on
12:37
his website. What this does is it won't allow him to copy from your website.
12:41
Like he won't be able to like copy anything. So just putting this setting
12:45
on is pretty cool. Um then recent sales notification. Have you guys seen those
12:50
pop-ups in websites down below? Like John from the US just bought a product 2
12:54
minutes back. Like there's a little pop-up on the left. Um so you can
12:58
actually have this on. Um this helps because kind of builds trust with the
13:02
customer that people are shopping on your website and um it it it yeah tells
13:07
them that more people are shopping so it builds trust and therefore they want to
13:10
buy from you. Um then payment logos I spoke about this yesterday PayPal, Visa,
13:15
Mastercard if you want them on the bottom of your website you can just
13:18
switch that on. And by the way this is all in vitals. You don't have to go
13:21
anywhere else just just for a context. Then you have trust seals if you want
13:25
like a 30-day money back guarantee. um you want to return badge not the text
13:30
you can actually use this um and then the next set of ones we have
13:36
here okay
13:48
yeah so even your add to cardart let's say have you seen those add to cardarts
13:52
which like shake and bounce and stuff like that have you guys noticed that
13:54
anytime so you can make your anim you can make your add to cardart animated.
13:58
You can make make it shake, wobble, bounce. It just gets the attention. I
14:02
know it's a small thing um but but these things matter. Um then you have your
14:06
email marketing funnel setup over here. You you can set up your pop-ups. Um you
14:11
can have stock scarcity. So let's say in your product page it says 27 pieces left
14:16
only. There's a little like widget like a bar, you know what I mean? So that is
14:20
something you can set up here. Um, you have countdown timers. If you want
14:26
to put countdown timers on your website, let's say the sale goes um the sale is
14:30
only live for the next 27 hours and there's a countdown timer on top. Uh,
14:34
you can have those. You can have announcement bars on top. Um, and again,
14:38
by the way, a lot of people I think even you were facing this issue with
14:40
connecting Facebook pixels, okay, um, to your website. All you have to do is go
14:45
on Facebook pixels over here, take your pixel ID, paste it, done. That's it. and
14:50
your pixel is done. So, I think you were facing that issue yesterday, you could
14:52
just um use the Facebook pixel app over here. And this is probably the easiest
14:56
way to connect your Facebook pixel. Anyway, for people who don't know what a
15:00
pixel is, it's basically a code which goes onto your website, uh which we use
15:04
while we're running ads. But again, um just so if anyone is running ads
15:08
already, you can use it. Um what else? You have size charts. Let's say you are
15:13
selling apparel and you want a size chart, you can have a size chart. You
15:16
have the spin the wheel. You guys have seen the spin the wheel, right? like
15:19
they spin the wheel and then they get a prize. Um, you have that too. Um, you
15:23
also have WhatsApp chat. Let's say you want a WhatsApp button on your website
15:26
for customers to reach out to you. There's a WhatsApp chat. So, a lot of
15:30
stuff in just one app, right? There's some issue again.
15:43
Yeah. Oh, no. The next one.
15:48
Yeah. Next one. Cool. Okay. So, this is another app you want to be using. Just
15:54
for context, every order that you get from PayPal, you have to upload the
15:59
tracking details to PayPal just so PayPal knows. So, I remember I told you
16:03
guys that there's a huge chance of you getting banned on PayPal and if you
16:06
don't do it the right way. Um this is something no one talks about but
16:10
essentially every order which is shipped if you upload the tracking ID with
16:14
PayPal then it builds trust because now PayPal knows you're shipping your orders
16:18
and therefore they know you're not like scamming people for example right so
16:23
there's one way to do it manually but there's another app which is um the
16:26
track 123 and what this does is it automatically uploads every tracking ID
16:31
to your PayPal um like on its own you don't have to do anything right so I
16:36
think this app is also um pretty important. Um yeah. Does that make
16:41
sense? Like how do you think this app works? Like uploading tracking from
16:45
somewhere. How do you think that works? Anyone?
16:59
Mhm. Exactly. So it it's the moment your
17:04
supplier shares the shipping ID with you, this app takes it from your
17:07
supplier automatically and uploads it on PayPal. PayPal kind of has this um trust
17:12
built between you and uh PayPal in the beginning that okay, you're you're
17:15
shipping out orders. So a huge reason why people people get banned is because
17:19
they don't upload their tracking IDs. And then um PayPal never says this to
17:23
you to upload tracking IDs, but I've personally found this and most people
17:27
who are uh know a few things about drop shipping know that they have to upload
17:30
tracking ID. So super important. Just download the app, set it up, and then
17:34
that's it. You don't do anything else. Sorry.
17:40
Yeah, it's it's like I think it's like $9 a month, so nothing crazy. Yeah. Like
17:45
for the effort, like imagine if you had to do it yourself like every day, like
17:48
20 like it's just Yeah. not worth your time. Um, this is another app that I use
17:52
for upsells alone. I think I focused on this in most of my lessons that the
17:59
product you sell to your customer isn't the only product you're trying to sell.
18:02
You're trying to sell to your customer at every step of the way. So, you're
18:05
selling on the product page, you're selling bundles, you're selling um
18:09
you're selling a product in the cart, you're even selling them shipping,
18:11
right? We're giving them fasttrack shipping. We're giving them um insured
18:15
shipping. We're giving them multiple shipping options because we want to be
18:18
selling to them at every point. So upsells is one of the best way to do
18:23
that. So what is the difference between an upsell and a cross-ell guys? Anyway,
18:27
anyone? Exactly. Yeah. So, a cross-ell basically
18:39
is like um a burger and a fry, you know, like a meal. And then a upsell
18:45
would be a a burger and like maybe a bigger burger or another burger. You
18:48
know what I mean? So, that's the difference between an upsell and a
18:51
cross-ell. You have to understand that while you're selling your product, you
18:54
want to be upselling and cross-selling as much as you can. Um it shouldn't be
18:58
very intrusive which basically means it shouldn't um look forceful but at the
19:03
same time it should look like okay you know what you could do with this too
19:07
like uh whenever someone tries to upgrade to a meal for example they're
19:10
not they never feel like it's being forced on them but they feel like I need
19:13
the fries I need the coke and therefore I'm going to buy the whole meal. So this
19:17
is another app. I'm dropping all the links here for you guys. Um so that you
19:22
guys can just click on it, get the discount and start off. Um yeah, the
19:26
next one you want to be using is yeah, we spoke about gem pages. Um any
19:35
sort of how many of you have tried using gem pages by now? Okay. What's what's
19:40
like your experience been? Okay. Anyone else?
19:48
Okay. Gem pages. Cool. So, yeah, this is the one-stop shop app for building a
19:53
very, I don't know, branded website because it gives you a lot of features.
19:58
Um, it also has some cool things like AB
20:03
testing. Okay, let's say you're not sure what price you want to be launching at.
20:06
Let's say you say, I don't know if it's going to work at $30 or $45. So what you
20:11
could do is make two landing pages and split your traffic 50/50 and test both
20:15
the prices. The page remains the same. The only thing which is changing is the
20:19
price. So it's quite possible that um the product that you were selling for 30
20:24
could be sold at 45 and that way you're making that extra $45, right? So um
20:30
sorry the extra 15 in this case. Um also the loading pages of these uh this uh
20:35
this tool is pretty fast. So, anyone who's not using Gem Pages right now
20:40
should eventually start using Gem Pages uh when they kind of start branding
20:43
their product pages out. Now, the next thing is after ship. Um I
20:48
think someone asked me about how like the tracking is going to be looking
20:51
because the tracking that your Chinese supplier is going to give you is
20:54
literally going to be in Chinese like written Chinese and that is if your
20:59
customer sees that um most in most in most cases they're not going to be happy
21:04
seeing a Chinese tracking number. So what after ship does is it gives you
21:08
like a full personalized shipping page which is like um it's a
21:14
proper branding track tracking page with personalized product recommendations.
21:18
And guess what? Let's say if they're trying to check their tracking, don't
21:20
you think that's another page where we can sell them something? So let's say
21:24
they go check their tracking and then you can have a section right below that
21:26
which says, "Hey, here are new products. Do you want to buy this too?" So you can
21:30
actually add more personal. It's like a sales page. It's a shipping page,
21:33
shipping tracking page, but you can use it like a sales page. Um, but again, you
21:37
can only do this through tools like after ship.
21:41
It also has an automated email and SMS notification. So, every time your order
21:45
is being shipped, packed, it's in transit, um, it's 5 days away, 2 days
21:50
away. Um, the biggest problem with drop shipping is the shipping time, guys.
21:54
Like, you know, we have a long longer shipping time. And don't be surprised if
21:58
most of your customers are going to be annoyed why the package is so late. The
22:02
only way we counter this, this is super important, is by informing them every
22:06
step of the way um you know where their order is. I'll give you an example like
22:10
if you go to a restaurant, you place an order. And there are two scenarios,
22:14
okay? Both the times the food takes too long, but in one case the waiter is
22:18
coming every like 5 minutes and being like, "Oh, your food's being made. I'm
22:21
really sorry. Like it's on the way. It's on the way." He's keeping you updated
22:24
versus like in one case no one comes to you. 40 minutes go by and then the food
22:28
comes. It's the same case, but in both the cases, you're going to be pissed in
22:32
the in the latter case, right? Because no one informed you. So even here, as
22:36
long as you keep them informed and as long as you tell them where their order
22:40
is and you keep them like in the loop, um the chances of them filing a
22:44
chargeback or getting pissed at you are way lesser versus you not telling them
22:47
anything. So I think you can also set this up and like I said, it's a
22:52
centralized shipping dashboard. So if they want to check their shipping, they
22:55
can just come here. Um, they also have this new tool where they have a AI
22:59
powered estimated delivery date. So, they can literally tell your customer
23:04
approximately what date they're going to get their order, which is which is I
23:06
think pretty cool. This is what um, you know, the page
23:11
looks like. Even brands like Gym Shark, I'm sure you guys have heard of it, use
23:14
this app. So, here's what the page would look like. Um, you know, this is what
23:18
the page would look like. It's like it would show in transit, it would show the
23:21
delivery date and then again it'll try to sell you something right here. Okay,
23:26
this is what a branded tracking page would look and what we usually see is
23:30
that enhanced branding tracking experience
23:34
give us 70% um increase in the satisfaction when it
23:39
comes to a customer experience. Um it says up to 75% reduction in the um
23:46
support tickets you get. So for example, you know what? You're going to get a lot
23:49
of emails like, "Hey, where's my order? Where's my tracking link?" Blah, blah,
23:52
blah. It's going to be a lot. So that's going to reduce majority of your emails
23:57
because guess what? The emails you get, you're going to be spending time
24:01
replying to them. So it's saving you time in the end, right? It's saving your
24:04
customer time. It's saving you time, which is again a cost at the end of the
24:07
day. Um, and then again it gives you like a you can make smarter decisions
24:14
about your supply chain because this dashboard will tell you exactly when
24:18
your product is going to land up to the customer and that way um you can see
24:21
that data. So okay like for example UK takes 7 days for shipping, the US takes
24:26
12 days. Um so you can basically tackle your customer accordingly based on where
24:30
they come from. It's not a one-sizefits-all. So it's not like if
24:33
someone places an order it takes the same time to get there. Europe takes
24:37
faster, US obviously takes longer because again it's on the other side of
24:40
the pond. So um it this is how that helps.
24:45
And then the next thing is um the AI assistant, right? So um someone can just
24:51
pull up a chat and talk to the AI and kind of like this is like a customer
24:56
support rep instead of you being that person. So if they have a doubt, they
25:00
can just hop onto the co-pilot chat and just start asking questions like, "Hey,
25:04
find my shipment. where's my order? Um, how long will it take? And then the AI
25:09
based on the shipping details that it has will speak to the customer. So this
25:14
way your customer support in a way has been automated through AI, which is
25:18
pretty cool. I know it doesn't sound very like um tedious right now, but when
25:23
your order volume goes up, let's say you're getting 100 tickets a day, which
25:26
is 100 emails a day. Trust me, it takes time. It's annoying. And in the
25:30
beginning, like in my case, yeah. It's an app.
25:44
Yeah. Yeah. It's an app. It basically
25:49
integrates with everything on your Shopify, pulls your tracking, puts it
25:52
all together, and then Yeah, you just have to design the page in the
25:55
beginning, like I showed you. So, you can make your own branded page. Once
25:58
your page is designed, everything else is taken care by the app.
26:02
Yeah. Um like yeah so in the beginning when
26:06
you're getting like a 100 emails a day or even 50 emails a day you have to do
26:09
it yourself. I remember when I started out I was replying to all the emails
26:12
myself and it's super annoying and it takes a lot of time. Uh in this case of
26:16
course this wasn't there back then. Um it just takes that away from you. They
26:20
can just go chat chat to the co-pilot and understand from the co-pilot where
26:24
their order is how long it's going to take. And I think even um the co-pilot
26:28
like even if the customer's pissed they have like the training where
26:32
um it kind of makes the customer feel a bit I don't know it just pacifies them
26:36
like hey it's going to be there don't worry right so I think that's also
26:39
pretty important um like I said shipment notifications so
26:45
this is how they're going to get SMSs on their number like hey your package is
26:48
now in transit um your package is now out for delivery and also they're going
26:53
to get notifications on their email which look like this. So, every step of
26:57
the way they know where their order is. Um, trust me, this is huge when it comes
27:01
to getting chargebacks or getting returns because if people um know where
27:06
their order is, it's so much more different than them not knowing. I know
27:10
like um in the end, you're going to say, "Okay, it still takes 10 days, right? It
27:14
doesn't matter." But there's a huge difference when they know versus they
27:17
don't. And I feel like if we put in that extra effort of telling them like every
27:21
day or every two days where their order is, then eventually once they get your
27:26
product, if the product is good and if they like it, it's fine. Now, of course,
27:29
if the product is [ __ ] and it's bad quality, they're still going to have a
27:31
bad experience and they're going to file a charge back. But as long as we what
27:35
I've noticed is even if my shipping time is like 12 days, which is a lot is a
27:39
long time. But as long as I've informed them and whatever my product is is
27:43
something they're happy with once they unbox it and they use it, then all is
27:47
well. and then they don't really have a problem with you. They actually leave
27:50
you a good review, which which is what I've seen in most cases.
27:54
Now, here's the branding tracking page. Um, you can drive customers back to your
27:59
site with your branding tracking page. You can add, you know, like this widget
28:03
over here, which is essentially what you see in most brands. Um, you get a
28:06
customized look and feel. Again, you guys have probably seen this in most
28:10
brands, but for a normal person to start off a business like you guys and this
28:15
wasn't there when I started, for example, right? So, this app is pretty
28:18
cool. Um, and you can also give them AI powered recommendations. So, for
28:22
example, if they shopped a certain product through AI, you can recommend
28:26
three more products that they probably could buy once they come back to the
28:29
page. So, um, as you can see over here, even here, they have like this banner
28:33
which talks about a new year sale. So let's say once they come back 5 days
28:37
later you have a sale going on you let them know about it and then through the
28:40
AI you recommend the products they might be interested in and this way I guess um
28:45
I don't know you maybe get to um make them buy again and by the way whatever
28:49
you make them buy again you can also see that in the dashboard so you can see
28:52
exactly how much sales you got from this page alone which is basically free sales
28:57
because you again are not spending any money um acquiring the customer.
29:03
So yeah guys, that was it. Pretty quick. Thank you. These are the apps. Um if you
29:08
have any questions, if you have any questions, we can just take questions
29:11
now. Yeah. So going back to the previous slide,
29:15
is it like embedded in your drop website or is it a separate link?
29:18
Uh it's it's a like you can embed it on your shipping tab. Like let's say they
29:22
click on shipping your website. This opens up.
29:24
Okay. How the customer like do we have an account on our website or
29:29
No, no, no. It's it's it's seamless. No accounts.
29:32
Oh, really? It just all they have to do is like put in their tracking number.
29:36
Okay. And then how do we make sure our customers don't receive like a Chinese
29:39
tracking number? This is so it converts the Chinese
29:42
tracking number into like English and then it
29:44
Okay. It just masks the whole thing, you know.
29:47
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then our tracking number to our
29:50
customers or something. Yes.
29:52
Yes. Yeah.
29:53
Will it be through this site? No. Uh both. Uh we could do both.
29:58
Yeah. What's the difference between
30:02
the other? Um I just feel like the other app has
30:06
more functionality when it comes to upsells um versus vitals is um
30:12
yeah I'm I'm again you can check both of them out if you're happy with upsells
30:16
and vitals. I feel like the other one upcard has just a lot more
30:19
functionality. You'll see like you get it's it's again like gem pages and
30:22
normal Shopify they do they do the same thing but you get more customizable
30:26
options. Do you know the pricing for each one?
30:29
Uh, I think vitals is like um I think it's about $29 a month. So, it's like
30:34
less than a dollar an app basically. Um, I think the PayPal one is about $9.99.
30:40
So, 10 bucks a month. Um, after ship would be around the same and Upcart
30:45
would be about 15 20. Yeah. I mean, again, you don't have to
30:56
get all of them. You definitely should get this one because this is 40 in one.
31:00
Make it's a no-brainer. You have to get gem pages. Um, the PayPal one, yes.
31:05
Everything else on top of that is the choice.
31:15
Just just email them saying like, "Hey, we didn't know. Like, give us a refund."
31:19
You got anything? I I just got charged $1,500 by an app.
31:24
Uh, and I just basically threatened them with a charge back. They would give me a
31:27
refund. You got to fight for your money, man.
31:29
Yeah. Yeah.
31:39
Faster than like the customer. Yeah.
31:51
Yeah. Cheaper or faster? Different things.
32:01
If you want it faster, the only way you can do that is um you got to hold stock
32:07
in the US for example. Or what you could do is you can so what happens is when
32:13
you place an order your supplier goes to a um Chinese factory and he tries to
32:19
source it. What you could tell him is like hey hold stock for me like hold 40%
32:24
of my stock beforehand. So the 2 three days he's going to waste in finding your
32:28
product that gets cut which is called the processing time.
32:33
So what happens is once he knows you're going to give him orders what he's going
32:36
to do is this is what I did. So my supplier while I was drop shipping used
32:39
to hold 40% of my stock already because he knew I'll get the orders, right? He's
32:44
not scared about that. So what? So that basically shaved 4 days off my shipping.
32:51
Yeah. I mean I mean the cost honestly like you
32:56
can't do much man. You kind of have to go with a private supplier like a
32:59
because he's going to source because he goes directly to the uh to the factory.
33:03
What most guys do is they go to the factory, they do a markup, and then they
33:07
sell it to you. So, in a private in a private supplers's
33:11
case, he's the only one who's going to charge his markup. So, you're going to
33:16
get a cheaper price. Yeah.
33:24
Is there any option? Whatend multi- vendor? Yeah. Yeah, you can.
33:33
Which one? All the apps that are shared for
33:38
suppliers are multi- vendor. Yeah.
33:48
I think uh in the in the LMS, right? The slides
33:54
the the slides. Yeah. Yeah. We we'll we'll upload it today.
34:00
Yeah. Yeah. Where do you usually find the slides?
34:05
Where where do the where do the slides go? Usually
34:09
the LMS or Yeah, the the LMS. Yeah, maybe you haven't checked. It's okay.
34:15
It's okay. Today it was a short one today.
34:22
Yeah. Yeah. Do they have any questions?
34:24
Um I think I think they're going to come.
34:29
Yeah.


Content & Marketing Creatives
22/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
 Mr. Ishan Suri
0:02
Okay, guys. So, how did you like the quiz?
0:04
I love it. Yeah.
0:09
Okay. Awesome.
0:12
So, um Okay, guys, can can we start? Can we
0:18
start? Awesome. So, firstly, how was your
0:21
weekend? Good.
0:23
Good. You guys had a good time? Yeah.
0:25
Awesome. So today's uh lesson is something which is I think uh pretty
0:30
interesting because it's about how to create organic short form content. Um
0:35
just a disclaimer I think the reason why it's also very interesting is because
0:39
I've used some of the same fundamentals that I learned from
0:44
e-commerce to build my own personal brand which is essentially creating
0:48
short form content which goes viral and it's got us tens and millions of views.
0:52
Um we're going to be splitting the session between today and tomorrow. So
0:57
there going to be a lot of things which are going to be because organic short
0:59
form is just too large big lesson to just take in one day. So I'm going to be
1:05
splitting into two pieces but we'll start today with organic short form.
1:08
Right. So here's how it looks guys. Um we are going to be having Tik Tok as our
1:14
primary platform to create content. I think I've said Tik Tok like a thousand
1:18
times since I've met you guys and there's a reason for that is because it
1:21
is the king of organic content. Um, so what we're going to be doing is starting
1:26
on Tik Tok, creating a piece of content and then repurposing that on Facebook,
1:32
Instagram, Pinterest and on YouTube. So pretty simple stuff there.
1:38
Let's now understand what is our Tik Tok strategy. So firstly, we're going to be
1:42
studying Tik Tok the algorithm and we're going to be finding trends which work.
1:48
The next thing is we're going to find inspiration from competitors and then
1:53
also our related niches. So let's say if you're in the kids niche, you're going
1:57
into that niche and vice versa for any niche that you're in. Um the next thing
2:03
I want to say is keep your feed fresh by adapting trends and niche ideas. So for
2:08
for example right now your Tik Tok is going to show you stuff which you are
2:12
interested in. So I would even suggest create a new account which is basically
2:17
just um and interact with e-commerce and drop shipping ads because the way it
2:22
works is when you click on an ad you go on the website you can add to cart
2:25
checkout. Don't buy it obviously but now you've trained the algorithm that this
2:29
is the kind of stuff you like and it's just going to show you more of that. So
2:34
I found a lot of my winning products just casually scrolling um and and
2:39
literally it's there. But again it doesn't happen on your normal Tik Tok.
2:42
It's going to happen on a Tik Tok which knows exactly what you were interested
2:46
in. And you got to train the algorithm to understand that okay you know what I
2:50
want more drop shipping products or e-commerce products to shop. In this
2:54
case we're not shopping we're finding. So the second thing is what's the
2:59
difference between drop shipping and the private label content. Right? So in drop
3:03
shipping, we're highlighting product features for viral potential. And if we
3:07
have a private label, we want to build a brand community to foster loyalty. Now,
3:12
a lot of you came to me in the beginning and you were like, what if we start this
3:16
series of like, you know, we're students in Teter and we're trying to build a
3:19
business and we're like 19 year old and stuff like that. I think my feedback was
3:24
that initially if I'm a customer and I see someone who's 17 18 and who's trying
3:29
to figure it out that kind of works against me because then the trust factor
3:34
is is kind of diminished. So I would position it in a different way. What I
3:39
would do is I would document your journey from building product ideation
3:43
to creating that product. So let's say even if you were think of it like you
3:48
position yourself as an experienced entrepreneur and now you're just trying
3:52
to find ideas for your product and you're trying to create the product and
3:56
you're showing that journey. You're showing the journey of building your
4:00
website but not a 17-year-old college student but an experienced entrepreneur.
4:05
It just changes the entire game, right? Because someone will now take you
4:08
seriously because you're showing them behind the scenes versus you saying,
4:11
"I'm a college student. I'm figuring it out for three months." Okay? very
4:14
different on how you position yourself when you create content. So if you want
4:18
to document your journey of building this business, I would say position it
4:23
as someone who knows their [ __ ] and now is creating products and showing you how
4:28
to do it. So it's like let me show you how to do it rather than oh I'm figuring
4:31
it out. Very different. The next thing is repurposing content. Um we're going
4:36
to be reusing content on reals, YouTube shorts, and Facebook to increase reach.
4:41
Uh there's a tool called Repurpose io for automating all of this which is
4:46
essentially you just posting your content piece on repurpose io and then
4:51
it just kind of distributes it across every platform. I will have some tips
4:57
here. What we have seen personally is that manual reposting can boost
5:01
engagement. I mean I don't have any like study for this but we have millions of
5:06
followers across all our uh social handles and we even till date post
5:10
manually because we've just seen that the algo doesn't like too much of
5:14
automation and I know that sounds a bit uh counterintuitive but we post manually
5:18
we do not use these tools but you can try it out if you want. Um the next
5:23
thing is okay how many of you have already started posting content for your
5:27
business? Okay, no one over here. Okay, this
5:32
anyone else? Cool. All I want to say about posting content
5:38
is the fact that let's say you want to sell in the US. Okay. But if you are
5:43
posting from a Tik Tok in the UAE, it's only going to show people in the UAE.
5:48
It's not going to show American customers, right? So all the reach that
5:52
you're getting are basically from people who will never buy from you, right? So
5:56
you need to understand where is my audience and who do I need to post to
6:01
and like who do I need to target. So in this case there's a quick hack. What I
6:06
would do is go on Fiverr and Upwork and I would hire a virtual assistant who is
6:10
in the region that I want to sell my product. So let's say if I want to sell
6:14
my products in Australia. So I will hire a VA in Australia and then send the
6:19
content to her or him and ask them to post for me because when they post in
6:24
their location, it's going to be showing the audience that we want to cater to.
6:29
Okay. Again, you can keep access and passwords and you know all the security
6:34
codes for your account if you're scared of losing it. Um, but essentially
6:38
posting in Dubai and getting views and then feeling happy about it is uh it
6:43
doesn't mean anything because let's say you're selling in the in Australia or in
6:46
the United States. So be very careful. If you're selling in the UAE and you're
6:50
posting from here, great. Doesn't doesn't matter. It doesn't even have to
6:52
be away we it could be a friend. It could be anyone whose IP is tracked as
6:57
that location that you want to sell to. Okay, does that make sense?
7:03
Okay, perfect. So now let's understand the different types of content. Um again
7:09
the formula for viral content is high retention, repeat watches, full videos,
7:14
uh full full views increase visibility on Tik Tok. What you guys have to
7:18
understand is the game. Now if you want to play the viral content game, you need
7:22
to understand what what the platform wants from you. Okay? The platform
7:28
rewards people who keep more people on their platform. It's as simple as that.
7:33
So when someone is actually scrolling and watching your content and you there
7:38
could be two situations. They either watch 3 seconds of it or they watch 20
7:41
sec 7 seconds of it. So the platform always wants people to be on the
7:46
platform. And therefore if you have content which keeps people on the
7:50
platform they reward you. Now how do I how do they reward you? They give you
7:53
more reach. It's as simple as that. If you get more reach, you get more sales.
7:57
You get more website visitors. So always remember that I like using this analogy
8:01
like it's like there's a customer over there. It's like you throw a rope and
8:05
you start pulling them in and that is how your content should be. Like if it's
8:10
a 30-second reel, every 3 seconds should have a certain cause. So of course
8:16
everyone knows what a hook is, right? It's the first 3 seconds, but then what
8:18
happens the next 3 seconds and what happens from second 9 to 12, then from
8:22
12 to 15? We break it down and we're going to cover that tomorrow. But that's
8:26
how you build a super super viral engaging ad by knowing every. So I have
8:32
this 1.5 second rule which I will cover tomorrow. But long story short when you
8:37
look at any short form content ask yourself the 1.5 second rule says that
8:43
there needs to be something happening every 1.5 seconds. Now, it could be a
8:47
transition, it could be a pop sound, it could be the clip changing, but the 1.5
8:53
second rule is everything something or the other needs to change every 1.5
8:57
seconds. We're going to cover that tomorrow. And we've been using this
8:59
formula this entire time. And like I said, it doesn't have to be something
9:02
crazy. It could be something as little as u just a sound effect, but there's
9:07
something happening every 1.5 seconds. Right now, I'm going to show you some of
9:11
the effective strategies that D2C brands or like e-commerce brands have used to
9:17
um go viral. The first one is this drop shipping website called Cheeky Glow.
9:25
Now, you all must have most of you must have seen, have you seen this product,
9:29
the the scrubber? Yeah. How many you seen it?
9:35
That's it. Okay. So,
9:38
someone wants to explain what this does. Exfoliates.
9:42
Yeah, exactly. It's a It's an exfoliator glove, which is a very old product and a
9:46
lot of people have been using it. Now, as you guys can see, these guys are
9:50
killing it. They have like almost 600k followers. This is all organic and it's
9:55
a very basic product. It's a very old product, but again, they're only able to
9:59
sell it. Look at this. Like 10 million views on this Tik Tok. It's crazy. So
10:03
the only way they can sell it is through content, right? The next one is this
10:08
thing called sud scrub. It's b essentially a scrubber. It's as basic as
10:13
that. Okay, they're selling a scrubber. And the and the reason I've used such
10:18
like basic products is to tell you that the only way you can sell basic products
10:23
is if your content is super super different. So it's a normal scrubber.
10:27
This guy just talks about how you can use the scrubber in different
10:30
situations. Um, so yeah, pretty pretty basic.
10:35
You must have heard of this one. How many of you have heard of the UDI?
10:40
Okay, so it's a wearable blanket. It's a almost a $900 million company now. Um,
10:46
it's basically just wearable blankets and all they've done, uh, I think the
10:49
founder is this guy called Davy Forgeti in Australian and he's just built a
10:53
brand over content. Of course, they do ads and everything else, but it's a
10:57
variable blanket with different designs, but you can see the real differentiation
11:01
is the content and how they are positioning themselves um in terms of
11:07
because you can find like a billion knockoffs like this in China. I'm sure a
11:10
lot of you would have done product research would have found something like
11:13
this. Did any of you find find something like this like a wearable blanket?
11:17
Exactly. So, but again there's only one brand and everyone else is Noise and
11:21
that's because of their uh viral marketing and essentially of course they
11:25
have a great product don't get me wrong but it's more the content that I feel
11:28
took them over the over the top right the next thing how many of you guys uh
11:35
all the I don't know have heard of these these this guy
11:41
anyone no where the where the my
11:47
Yes. Yes. Exactly. Spanish Hispanic guy, right?
11:51
The shoe cleaners. The Sorry.
12:00
Yeah. Yeah. So, it's it's something like he he says something like
12:05
when he sees the it says something like when you when I see the foam, I get in
12:10
the zone. That's his tagline. But anyway, this guy's basic. Okay, look at
12:14
his following by the way. 16 million followers, 240 million likes. It's
12:19
absolutely crazy. And I'll tell you how I found this guy, okay? Uh this is like
12:22
Spanish content. Again, not something that I'm into, but I was doing research
12:26
for my shoe cleaner that I launched yesterday for one of my brands, and then
12:31
I was just searching for viral people, and then I found this guy, and he's
12:34
super funny. Uh he drops like hot sauce and like mud on his shoes, and then he
12:39
starts cleaning it. Um and it's as basic as that. And I think he's very funny.
12:43
He's just a funny looking guy. He talks real funny. Um, so I feel like that's
12:47
why he's going viral. But here are some examples of what you could do with your
12:50
product. Again, there's no like HD content shoot or something which is like
12:55
super high definition. It's basic stuff. It's a it's a it's a shoe which is dirty
13:00
and now he just puts it in different scenes for it to go viral. Okay.
13:06
Now uh the different types of content guys what you have to understand is that
13:13
one second guys. Yeah. So the different types of content is
13:19
essentially how do we find affiliates? What are affiliates for products?
13:24
Anyone? What what's an affiliate? Yeah.
13:29
So basically you give a someone they can use it to bring you sales.
13:33
Yeah. Sure. Okay. So we have to find different affiliates because we
13:37
ourselves can only do so much marketing. So therefore we have to find affiliates
13:42
who can help us push the product in an organic manner. Right? So viral content
13:48
needs a strong hook, product benefits and viewer engagement. I'm going to
13:51
teach you guys tomorrow on how to create a strong hook or let's say how to create
13:56
a strong reel. So we're going to go over that tomorrow. Um and yeah this is
14:00
basically repurposing content which is again like I said we have to repurpose
14:04
content across all pages. Yeah. Yeah. In the beginning what you want to
14:13
do is like I'm going to share tomorrow like this SOP on like how to find the
14:16
right creators and how to reach out to them how to negotiate with them
14:21
everything from like start to finish. There are some platforms which do this
14:25
for you, but they charge like $500 a month as a fee, which I think is
14:29
obviously something that you don't want to take on right now. So, you can help
14:33
uh you can just do it manually yourself. And when you're at scale, you can use
14:35
those platforms. What's the followers?
14:38
So, micro micro influencers or nano influencers less than 10k 10k followers.
14:43
Yeah. Right.
14:48
Okay. Okay, so the next thing is how to scale with short form organic. Um, again
14:53
we have influencer collaborations. Pretty basic.
14:56
Then we have content reach. We want to be reaching people who are also just in
15:01
our audience and not everywhere. And then we want to give them an incentive.
15:05
Okay, like what is the incentive here? Profit sharing. Or we give them a
15:11
percentage of our sales. Now profit sharing can be as high as 50%. Now
15:15
you'll ask me like 50% is too high. But if they're doing all the job, they're
15:19
creating the content, they need a bigger incentive in place for them to do that.
15:23
So therefore, I could even go as much as 50% profit share. And if I'm giving
15:28
Yeah. for us, it's like a free sale.
15:31
Yeah. Exactly. It's a free sale. And it's like not even that. Like if their
15:34
content does well, I'm going to use that as an ad and get a [ __ ] ton of sales
15:37
through my ads, too. So, it's like a win-win. Right. Now, um here's how we do
15:42
multi- channelannel expansion because we don't want to focus on just one channel.
15:45
We want to be focusing on multiple channels. So we encourage influencers to
15:49
share on Tik Tok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube because guess what? In the
15:53
beginning, our Facebook, our Instagram is barely going to have a following. So
15:57
we need to leverage their platforms, right? So, we're going to tell them to
16:01
repurpose this viral content and then even use some of the good ones for our
16:06
ads, you know, because usually when you test ads, you spend money, but this is
16:11
literally testing for free because you know exactly what works and then you
16:15
just take that piece of content and you run it run it as an ad. So, that's
16:18
pretty uh pretty cool like I think in the beginning. Now, what's the
16:22
implementation and growth? uh you collaborate with creators to drive
16:25
traffic and you you of course have a revenue share with them which helps you
16:30
grow exponentially. Um here is what it's going to look like
16:35
guys. So you will have your brand accounts. Let's say you have four brand
16:38
accounts. This is what it would look like. So you create four pieces of
16:43
content and then you just repurpose everything across all your brand
16:47
channels. But just imagine this. If you see this, this is like us for example,
16:52
but this is also an influencer. Now, if I could just get 50 of these, then just
16:57
imagine the chain reaction that I create with people posting content and
17:01
repurposing it. So, just with one piece of content, I have repurposes repurposed
17:05
things five times over here, five over here. So, in total, I have 20 pieces of
17:09
content going out maybe on a daily basis, which is absolutely mental
17:13
because again, I'm posting like hundreds of pieces of content um weekly.
17:20
Now guys, here is a quick assignment for you guys right now, okay?
17:27
And which is you have to research and identify the top three viral competitors
17:32
for your product. Short list the three most viral Tik Tok links based on your
17:37
product. Sit with your teams for this, by the way, and write a short
17:40
explanation of how you would repurpose and adapt this to your brand. You guys
17:46
have 10 minutes and then we present. Let's go.
18:21
Timer. Timer. Timer. I think we we can we can start from
18:57
anywhere. I think let's start from this side. These guys are a little less more
18:59
engaging. police are down there. Oh, we're going to start.
19:41
Okay, guys. So, we're starting over here, right?
19:45
Yeah. Cool. So, tell me, let's start off with like your top three competitors and
19:50
then you move on to the pieces. Excuse me, guys.
19:53
Yeah, we we have someone starting. So, I know. One of them is actually
20:03
one of the videos that it's a viral. Uh, let's let's start with your top three
20:08
competitors like what are the names? The top three competitors
20:13
for the glasses is Raymond. For us, okay. So, how how are you planning to
20:31
repurpose their content and what is the content essentially?
20:34
More importantly, yeah, for the Facebook product, the content is
20:38
basically a girl showing the live So basically she just lifts the half of
20:43
her face and it looks like she's like startled or something and then the other
20:47
one and you actually see like oh wow this works. And the way we can repurpose
20:51
that is that a lot of people are still skeptical about it. So we can do it and
20:55
see like no way that's for real. Let's try it and make it like organic not like
21:00
in this product. No more in like okay I'mma try it myself to see if it
21:05
actually works and that way people can feel more related and more like
21:09
Yeah, I actually like that idea. And what I would just add to that, um, if
21:14
you go on your product competitor's product page on, let's say, Amazon,
21:18
they're going to be one and two star reviews of people who didn't like it for
21:21
whatever reason. I would take those, it's called objection handling, right?
21:25
Whatever they had a problem with, I would use that as a hook. Like, let's
21:29
say they give a one star and say, "I didn't like this about it." I would
21:31
literally be like, "Oh yeah, that." And then I move on to but and then I come on
21:35
to the pitch, which is like, you know what I mean? So I hook them by basically
21:38
talking about the problem and then eventually I move on to the actual
21:41
solution. Yeah.
21:54
How they pract or they do some activity with it and
22:00
show how stable it is and the quality. And we could probably do the same thing
22:04
but do more like do different stuff, different activities which we haven't
22:08
done and show and just like the way she said see and show the customers that it
22:15
actually works. Okay, cool. Good. Let's go.
22:19
Yeah. Next one. Okay, we
22:40
Are you ready? Okay guys, so let's start off with our
22:53
top three competitors and their top three viral pieces of content and how
22:57
are we going to repurpose that piece of content.
23:00
Okay, so we're selling a match kit. Uhhuh.
23:04
I think the top three are matcha and then
23:11
they also sell like the powder. We're not trying to sell that.
23:17
So the difference we're practicing more on
23:22
styling colors and just like products are down.
23:30
Okay, that's it.
23:34
Okay, cool. All right, good. Fair.
23:47
All right, guys. Guys, guys, can we have some silence,
24:04
please? We have some Yeah, go ahead. Okay,
24:16
let's start with competitors. Top three. So we have no MISK.
24:30
Yeah. Okay. I did one for you.
24:33
So basically we have no MI company and um and Stacy.
24:38
Okay. All them offer similar products,
24:41
different prices. Most of them are actually more expensive than us. So
24:45
that's how we're making USB. We're offering kind of the same. Uh and also
24:49
we're bringing activity as part of that's fine. But in terms of content,
24:52
let's say they're doing a bunch of things. What do you plan to use from
24:56
there? Viral content. Repurpose it with your brand voice. How you plan to
25:00
We actually have a Google Photos file with all the ideas that we have and
25:04
we're recreating them. So, for example, last week we recreated a video, not of
25:09
the our main competitors, but the similar kind of niche, and we got 21,000
25:13
views. Okay. That's what we're doing. We're
25:15
testing what is already working, and it's going pretty well.
25:18
Nice. Good stuff. Um okay
25:38
and yoga and yeah regarding our content we trying to do collaboration we already
25:48
that's our compet. Yeah. But let's talk about the most
25:54
viral pieces of content um that again these guys are also starting out. Let's
25:59
talk about more established brands. What are their viral pieces of content and
26:03
how are you plan to repurpose their content into you?
26:19
and try to use a mix of both.
26:30
Okay, cool. Nice. All right, who's next? Let's go with the glasses.
26:43
Our competitors are brand and
26:54
something. Fair enough. Yeah, that's a good
27:06
strategy. All right, who is next? I think we can also take
27:12
some from that side now, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
27:16
Yeah. Yes. top three competitors. And then
27:38
We got to see that there's not something
27:58
we said for all this and then in October
28:04
last week for no.
28:22
Okay. Okay. Cool. Do you think direct shipping is still
28:40
possible if you don't have a personal brand?
28:42
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't I didn't have a
28:45
personal brand when I started out. Yeah. But like right now there's so much
28:48
competition that if you don't send that Yeah.
29:03
Uh, can you can you speak a bit louder, please? I can't hear you.
29:07
I can't hear you. Yeah, just a bit louder. Louder. Yeah.
29:12
Guys, can we have some silence, please? We have some people talking here. Thank
29:15
you. Okay, cool. All right.
29:51
top three competitors and then how you plan to use their content.
30:02
Sorry. It's fine. It's fine. As long as they're
30:07
doing well with organic content, we can use we can use their content again.
30:10
Yeah. And there's also
30:28
the functions of every second. They show that second
30:37
side. something like that.
30:52
Okay, cool. Yeah.
31:07
So, our biggest areas So yeah, we have three.
31:17
There is frogs. There's sassy.com
31:22
and station. Uh and the topic have been found
31:27
yet,000. how we input with them is like we can
31:41
show them and it will be like so so sorry just to start with I don't
31:47
want I I want to be looking for more viral pieces of content so 70 80,000
31:51
views is not a lot I'm looking for something in the millions
31:54
yeah so something more viral because 70 80 is not bad but it's like what you
31:59
would want to achieve but if you if you take inspiration from
32:02
the guy who has 7080 you'll probably get like seven or eight you know what I mean
32:05
so more more viral pieces of content essentially Yeah.
32:09
So, how can we be like we could use the links for our email marketing? We could
32:16
make like stickers or chips. We could also make videos that
32:23
we could like this match or we sell this. You can buy this from us that way.
32:30
Okay. Cool. multi
32:44
to not only your life but also what what it helps you to achieve. So that's like
32:53
our focus and market of the world
33:03
in the name and also different
33:08
specifically that are online and also so we
33:17
um and we are going to focus to bring the product the 1% of daily communicate
33:24
with humans like speakers uh and bring it into their daily routine. So how it
33:30
does not help them but improve the whole scenario of life and more like what
33:38
facility help them to achieve for example in a campaign
33:44
thing that happens. Okay. So things like that bring to that
33:49
not just what Okay. All right.
34:06
Yeah. So, if you want to sell on Amazon, you need stock.
34:11
Yeah. You can't drop ship on Amazon. That's the problem. So, yeah, that's a
34:15
different game altogether. Yeah.
34:18
Cool. Cool. So I think should we Yeah. Okay. We have one more. Can we have one
34:23
last one over here guys? Can you pass the mic here please?
34:26
Yeah. We'll have one last one and then we resume.
34:31
So right now our biggest competitors is one is Ento and the other is so what
34:37
they've done is they've taken like original content which is like oh hot
34:40
girls and then they show their websites and they show their content which I
34:44
think is we've seen a lot of that. So instead of just showing our
34:49
I want to do this. We like
34:53
but instead of showing it how to use it, right? So we want to show how that has a
35:01
very impact on your daily life. So these are things and this is how I
35:07
you know a better. So you want to show how to use it and
35:11
then the end result. Yeah. Because I want to show how
35:13
effective it can be rather than Yeah, that's good. I like it. So there's
35:16
no it's focused on the network by factor
35:21
and also what like how do they feel after using it?
35:24
So most of them are just short clips but we want to make our content more
35:28
interactive so you know it sells better and more emotions.
35:33
Got it. Yeah I like it. Cool. Awesome. So any
35:37
um yeah I like it. I think more more demo and more selling the feeling and
35:41
the end result versus the actual template because just selling the
35:45
template is essentially thousands of people doing it. U I would even like
35:49
maybe induce some a model or a when I say model I say a person who after using
35:55
that looks a certain way thinks a certain way talks a certain way um and
35:59
it's like version one versus version two of someone. Yeah. And about
36:05
is it competitive? Not really. Not really. We're going to
36:10
cover that tomorrow and how and which influencer to kind of reach out to. Of
36:13
course, if you go with someone with which has like hundreds and thousands of
36:16
followers, it becomes an issue. Um, but if you go for micro influencers, then
36:21
they are pretty ambitious in the beginning. So, they will work with
36:26
people who are just starting out. Also, do it for a commission.
36:29
Yeah, we have to convince them and we'll go over that tomorrow. Cool. I think uh
36:34
All right, guys. So, I I think everyone shared uh I don't I know we didn't cover
36:38
everyone. Um but I'm guessing most of you or all of you have their uh organic
36:43
part figured out at least with this. Now, we're going to move on
36:48
and let's talk about what our influencer and affiliate collaboration strategy is.
36:55
So, the first thing you want to do is define your objective. What do you
36:59
really want from them? Do you want sales? Do you want brand equity? Now, I
37:02
know the most common answer is yeah, all I care about is sales, but just to give
37:06
you background, every influencer works a certain way. The next thing I want to do
37:10
is track effectiveness. How do I track which influencer got me how much,
37:16
I don't know, website visits or revenue. So, we have to track that because if you
37:20
don't track it, then we don't know who to work with going forward. So, I think
37:24
tracking is super super important. And then again it's pretty basic here but I
37:28
want to focus on people who are viral creators who understand the product for
37:33
content dynamics. So okay what is what is PMF?
37:39
PMF anyone heard of PMF. So PMF is one second guys excuse me one
37:46
behind you. So PMF is product market fit. Heard of that?
37:52
Yeah but CMF or in this case is content market fit which
38:00
basically means that sometimes just to make the product to fit in the market I
38:05
first have to achieve CMF which is content market fit so these influencers
38:10
need to understand how to really convey a message to the audience because let me
38:15
tell you this a large number of following doesn't mean anything if they
38:19
can't communicate the actual product to the end customer and I barely look at
38:23
actual following but I look at engagement ment more. Okay, so tomorrow
38:27
we're going to be also going through how do we calculate engagement? They could
38:31
be someone with 100k followers, but if their engagement is 0.25%.
38:36
That doesn't make the cut. They could be someone with, I don't know, 3,000
38:39
followers, but with high engagement, I'd rather work with that person. So, you
38:43
have to understand who to work with to start with.
38:47
Now, here's a quick graph of why consumers follow brands on social media.
38:51
I think we do know this but I just thought I'd put it out in a visual way.
38:56
So most of them want to learn about new products. The next they want to
39:01
basically know about company news. Then we have promotions and discounts. Again
39:06
40% of them just feel like being entertained which is fine. So when you
39:09
know that 40% of them want to be entertained you could be posting content
39:13
which is entertaining. Pretty simple. You don't always have to sell to your
39:17
customers in this case because when you keep selling it gets repetitive and
39:21
boring for people and then some want to be educated some want to connect with
39:25
people who are just like them. So let's say if you're selling uh I don't know a
39:29
matcha kit someone said over here right so I want to be connected to people who
39:32
are into matcha who might be into some other common interests right so this is
39:37
just some uh a graph on why people follow us on social media um the next
39:43
thing you want to do is engage actively so stay updated on trends and use native
39:47
tools for scheduling and then convert to sales you have to set a KPI with your
39:51
influencer like okay how okay let me ask you this if I reach out to someone and
39:56
how do How do I judge if this person did well in the influencer campaign or not?
40:00
How do I judge that? How many sales you had?
40:04
Okay. How many sales you had? But what is that like metric like a dollar, $100?
40:09
What is it? The whole Yeah. Okay.
40:14
The conversion rate. Okay. The conversion rate. They're all
40:18
right answers here, guys. But what I'm saying is that set the KPI or the key
40:22
performance indicator of that campaign before they start. So it's like okay the
40:28
conversion rate should be 3% or let's say the sales here should be at least
40:32
$500. You need to have those KPIs set before otherwise even if someone gets a
40:38
dollar in sales it's technically sales but does that help us? Probably not. So
40:42
have those KPIs set up otherwise it becomes a problem. Now the two
40:46
objectives of influencer campaigns is one brand equity, number two sales.
40:52
Pretty obvious. Uh here are some ways of measuring from Shopify. So let's say I
40:57
posted this piece of content and it got thousands of views. I can actually go on
41:02
the date. I know you guys can't probably see this graph very clearly, but you can
41:05
go on Shopify analytics and see for that exact date, was there a sales spike? Was
41:10
there something which was abnormal in that day? And therefore that helps me u
41:16
measure the results of the campaign. And again the next thing is discount codes.
41:20
Just create discount codes for each influencer so that all the sales you get
41:25
from that influencer are tracked through that discount code. If you go on Shopify
41:29
you will see that let's say discount code X Y whatever got you X amount of
41:34
sales and this is how you track. And this is the hiring part. Again this is
41:37
probably a lot of you. Um but in your team when it comes to content guys you
41:42
need to decide who's what. So we need a social media manager, we need a content
41:46
creator and then we need a influencer manager. So someone who reaches out to
41:50
influencers, has a sheet um you know and and trust me you want to be very very
41:56
careful with who you give what to. So essentially of course the content
41:59
creator needs to be good in creating content. The influencer manager should
42:03
be someone who can do quick reachouts, close deals, is good in negotiation. The
42:07
social media manager is someone who is a little bit on the top and managing
42:11
everything and therefore posting the content doing all these things. So
42:14
decide in your team who is what and then also lay down their responsibilities so
42:20
that it's not like oh I told you to do so didn't get done. It's very clear on
42:24
what the objectives are for each person and therefore um I'm sure each team
42:30
would have one of these. Um, and even if you don't, well, someone has to step up
42:35
and do the job, right? Now, here's how you find creators on Tik Tok. It's super
42:40
super easy. UGC creator. So, user generated creator. The moment you search
42:45
that, most influencers have a UGC creator in their name itself. So, if I
42:50
just search on the people's tab, I will find a bunch of UGC creators that I can
42:55
just literally reach out to. Um, and then yeah, that's that's pretty much it.
43:00
Like in terms of Tik Tok, that's how I how I would find influencers. I will
43:04
share with you more in-depth strategies tomorrow on how to find influencers. But
43:08
this is something you could do. Now, here's another way of coming up with
43:11
angles. When you search for your product on the right, you will see the most
43:16
search keywords for the product or or for the niche. So, let's say if it's a
43:21
beach product, if it's a beach tent, people are looking for beach aesthetic,
43:25
beach essentials. um you know so my hook could be one beach essential you can't
43:30
do without or something like that. So this is good to kind of find angles.
43:34
Now here's the action plan guys so pay attention. How do you plan a full month
43:38
of content in 30 minutes and this is for your brand. This is for your product.
43:42
And honestly this is also for your personal brand. If you guys create
43:45
content for yourself you could use the same stuff over here. So here's step
43:49
number one. Um, I want to research and shortlist 5 to 10 viral competitors in
43:55
my niche. The next thing I want to do is create a sheet with three tabs. Tab
44:00
number one, competitors. Tab number two, most viral content of those competitors.
44:05
Tab number three, the angles they've taken. So, summarize the hooks, the
44:09
formats, the tones. So, now what what you're going to have is from your five
44:14
competitors, you would have 10 posts each. Therefore, you will have 50
44:18
content angles just by doing this. Does that make sense guys? Everyone?
44:24
Yeah. Cool. Okay. The next thing is step one. Decide your level. Who? Beginner,
44:29
intermediate, pro. Do we have a pro in the house?
44:36
No, no, no, no. Not me. Not me. Okay. So, anyone who's an intermediate who
44:40
posts 10 posts per week? Okay. Okay, so we've got some
44:44
intermediate people, but most of you will be beginners and that's completely
44:47
fine, but you got to be doing five posts per week at least. Okay, and this is
44:52
like a non-negotiable. So understand which level you are and
44:56
then decide where you want to go. So beginner post, 20 posts a week. The next
45:02
thing you do, which is step two, is finding your outliers. So go on the
45:05
competitors page and find an outlier. And most competitors have their most
45:11
viral pieces of content pinned. So I think that makes the Yeah.
45:15
We post the same quantity of content in Instagram and Tik Tok or is different
45:22
four times a day or Instagram only one. I mean if it's the same content and it
45:27
doesn't require a lot of work just do it the same times like three on Tik Tok
45:32
three on and I'm going to get to that how to do that right right now. So guys,
45:36
this is important. Step three is select the top 10 to 15 videos from the person
45:43
like I showed you and then write this down. Very important. What was the hook?
45:48
What was the topic? And what was the format of that content? Okay.
45:54
And now what I want to do is mix and match. So for example, I would go with
45:58
hook two, topic three, and format one. And all I'm doing right now is mixing
46:05
and matching the hook, the topic, and the format. And by the way, this is
46:09
based on datadriven stuff. It's not based on random topics. It's topics
46:13
which went viral for them the most. It's the hook which went viral for them the
46:18
most. And it's also the format. Let's say it wasn't a real, but it was a
46:21
kousle, for example. So, this is what I do. And this way, you could have
46:24
multiple combinations. And this alone will get you ideas for
46:31
hundreds of pieces of content because all you've done is basically miss mixed
46:35
and matched your top five competitors hook topic format. Um and that's going
46:39
to help you. Is that going to make it easier for you guys to start creating
46:43
some content now? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Awesome. So let's talk
46:48
about content recreation. So step one, order your product. Recreate viral
46:53
styles. I just showed you how to find those viral styles. Then what you want
46:57
to be doing is posting on Tik Tok reels, uh, everything. Okay? And then adapt
47:02
viral angles. You do want to add your voice branding. Excuse me, guys. Sorry.
47:10
Um, okay. So, this is how you also adopt your voice of your brand. So, you want
47:15
to do all this, but you also want to have your own touch, right? Because
47:17
otherwise, what's the point? Now, here are some nonnegotiables for virality.
47:23
Most people want to go viral but most people don't want to do the things which
47:27
make them go viral. Okay. So the first thing is have a campaign calendar ready
47:31
for at least 5 to 7 days in advance. So let's say I'm sitting today. I need to
47:35
need need to know what's going on in the next week. Okay. Post daily. Consistency
47:40
is key. Aim for three posts per day by only changing the hook. So someone asked
47:45
me over here like can I post three times a day? If I have one piece of content
47:49
and all I do is just change the first 3 seconds twice. Now I have three pieces
47:52
of content. So the work is not a lot. Now that's what I mean by repurposing
47:58
one content idea into multiple variations. And always remember virality
48:02
is patience plus volume. You cannot discount that. So you need to be patient
48:07
and you need to have volume. And I see a lot of people also struggling because of
48:12
this because they're like I need my post to be the most aesthetic post ever and
48:16
I'm not going to post today because it doesn't look aesthetic enough. Let me
48:19
tell you the person who posts versus the person who dwells on aesthetic post for
48:23
the next three four days. Who do you think wins? So you do not have to focus
48:28
on perfection. You have to focus on just showing up. And showing up in this case
48:33
is posting every single day, right? And uh trust me, the the whole volume part
48:38
is super important. So here's how I would repurpose. So for example, I make
48:43
one reel. Okay, this is my original reel. All I do is I make the second one
48:48
with a different hook. So what nobody tells you about this product. That's my
48:51
hook. Everything else in this read is the same. Now read number three. Here's
48:56
why this product blew up. Hook. Everything else is the same. So with
49:00
very little effort now I have three pieces of content going out. Right? So I
49:05
don't create three separate pieces of content. I've just taken the same reel,
49:10
changed the hook, and I could do this like 10 times. Instagram also has a
49:14
feature called trial reels. Okay, we've been using it a lot and it's a cheat
49:18
code to basically going viral. Like I I don't even know how many people don't
49:22
use it. The whole cool thing about trial reels is Instagram will only show the
49:27
reel to nonfollowers. So from the get- go, I'm not showing it to my people. I'm
49:32
showing it to new people. Okay? So I get new followers for free. That's one. And
49:37
secondly, I get to know. So what I usually do is I make three I make like
49:41
three hooks. I post all three and I wait for 24 hours and you will see a clear
49:46
difference of one reel going viral versus the other one. And then I
49:49
eventually end up posting the one which got more views and gave me new followers
49:54
for free. Like no effort, right? So this is a cheat code like I think many people
49:59
don't talk about it and I don't talk about it because usually I don't want
50:02
other people to know about it but of course I'm sharing with you guys
50:04
otherwise everyone's going to go viral, right? Uh and but but we use this so
50:07
much. We've been using this and got hundreds of thousands of followers just
50:11
doing this. Pretty simple. And guess what? There's no added effort. Like all
50:16
you're doing is changing like 3 seconds here, 3 seconds here, boom, and that's
50:20
it. And then yeah, it's obviously not as simple as this guys, but this is the
50:24
road map, right? So yeah, guys, that's it for today. I hope you liked it
50:32
and and let's let's go. Uh you know what? Let's start creating that content.
50:37
I'm super excited. Uh content is something which is close to my heart.
50:40
We're going to have a lesson tomorrow too. U but yeah, let's start posting
50:43
today.




Content & Marketing Creatives

 Mr. Ishan Suri


0:24
Here it is.
1:10
Six people left. There's six people in here.
1:36
Okay, I'm start good.
2:33
Heat. Heat. All
4:24
right. Thank you.
5:07
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
5:11
Thank you. Also, where is the content team sitting
5:14
on? I think I they told me after class today I have
5:16
Yeah. At 1:30. Okay. So, where do I have to go? Javi
5:19
will like You're doing a lot of time on this.
6:23
That's me. question.
7:28
Come on. It's close.
7:53
Guys, just a quick announcement before you leave. You'll find that on your
7:56
coach there's one new milestone that has been added. The deadline is tonight. We
8:00
just need you to put all your social media links there. So, your uh Tik Tok.
8:09
Yeah. Hey, okay guys, can we settle down please?
8:13
Thank you. All right. Is everyone seated? Uh,
8:26
okay guys, let's settle down and let's start.
8:32
Okay. So, we had a lesson yesterday on organic
8:37
short form. Um, but think of yesterday's lesson as a bit of an introduction and
8:42
today's is going to be more of a master class. I feel like this is probably one
8:46
of the most important modules of the entire uh I don't know cohort because I
8:51
feel like whoever understands organic content they understand how to sell they
8:56
understand ads. So I'm pretty excited to share this with you guys. Um so yeah
9:01
let's begin. So here's what we're going to do guys. We're going to be talking
9:04
about pro processes frameworks and tools which drive our content. Okay. Uh what's
9:12
the challenge? The challenge is that the rising customer acquisition cost or the
9:16
money you spend on Facebook is high and the only way to lower this cost or the
9:21
CPA the cost per acquisition is by having better creatives. So what is a
9:27
datadriven content sourcing strategy? It's basically uh aligning media buying
9:32
for consistent creative testing and iteration. What is media buying anyone?
9:40
Okay. So media buying. Okay. products bought on social media or some sort of
9:44
I know so essentially when you run ads it's called media buying because you're
9:48
buying media from Facebook so you are a media buyer right that's
9:53
what the term in uh marketing is so I think uh you guys know this you
9:59
have media buyers guys who run ads you have the creative strategy team which
10:03
comes up with angles writes the scripts and briefs and then you have the
10:07
production team which basically um creates the content in your teams right
10:11
Now are you guys segregated in this way where you have let's say the creative
10:15
people, the production people or like do you have that in your team right now or
10:19
is everyone doing everything? Yeah, we have
10:24
okay you you have you have people. So who's who's the creatives? Do you have
10:27
like do you have it this way? Not exactly but we know who fits in
10:31
where and we kind of work with that. Okay. So anyone going forward you should
10:35
have this because then the roles are very defined and this is like a loop
10:39
right because the person who does the creatives sends it to production they
10:43
send it to the guys who run the ads then you get feedback from the ads so they
10:47
give it back to the creative people and then this loop keeps on going. Now here
10:51
are 10 emotional motivators that um you can use to basically create content for.
10:58
It could be something as basic as um they want to have confidence in the
11:03
future. They want to enjoy a sense of well-being. They want to stand out from
11:06
the crowd. These are the 10 emotional motivators that you want to sell to your
11:12
audience because you always sell the emotion, not the feature or the benefit,
11:15
right? So here are the 10 emotional motivators that you guys can use. Now
11:19
this is super interesting. This is the direct response copywriting. Okay? And
11:24
uh it's out of these books called cash advertising and breakthrough advertising
11:28
like legendary. It's like the bible of marketing. And essentially what you do
11:32
is with every product that you have you first call out a burning problem or a
11:36
painoint. The next thing you do is you agitate and you focus on the problem.
11:41
How does it manifest? How does the problem manifest? And what will happen
11:45
if it doesn't get solved? Okay. Then you discredit. So you discredit your entire
11:49
competition. you discredit every other product out there or every other
11:53
solution out there. So you can basically then give a solution which is your
11:58
product. So again problem agitate discredit solution. This is the way you
12:02
go about it on writing your scripts. I spoke yesterday about how creating a
12:07
strong hook is super important. The first 3 seconds of your ad are the most
12:12
important 3 seconds. If you mess this up, you've messed the whole creative up.
12:15
Um and that is why you need to look at your hook as your targeting. and it
12:19
filters your audience. So essentially if you have a bad hook then the audience
12:23
that you have will not be interested. So today what we're going to do is talk
12:27
about some hook ideas. So like you can start with the product like this acne
12:30
serum sold out five times. You can start with the problem. Stop using makeup to
12:34
hide breakouts. So you can start with solving the problem, right? Uh you can
12:38
ask a question about the problem. Tired of breakouts and skin bumps. And then
12:42
you can make a list like three ways the serum fights acne. So here are some hook
12:46
ideas you guys can use. And to make it even more simpler for you all, what I've
12:50
done is I've built a hook library. So, uh let's do a quick exercise like give
12:55
me a product guys. Anyone? Watches.
12:57
Watches. Okay. Um let's go to which one would you pick out of these
13:04
for your watch? Which one?
13:11
Okay. My goto watch for Okay.
13:20
Um, if I
13:24
cool. Yeah. If you're like me and you love watches and this is for you. So,
13:28
like what you can do is essentially put any product and um, stop wasting your
13:34
money on cheap watches. This is the best watch I've ever tried. Uh, things I've
13:40
knew, things I wish I knew about sooner. And then you start with the watch. So it
13:44
could be anything. Okay, you can just take this hook library and you can just
13:48
attach your product or your problem and yeah
13:54
products as well. For which products?
13:56
For high ticket products. Yeah, it goes for everything. I mean
14:00
essentially u you know want to know the secret of to the best time management
14:05
and then you talk about the watch. It can go for any product. Cool. So again
14:09
you'll get access to this or you can take a picture whatever you're going to
14:12
get access to this today in the evening. So you can get it from there. Now here
14:16
are the three types of hooks. Um you first show the problem and then you show
14:22
the solution. Okay. Um this is the problem solution hook. This is a before
14:28
and after. So for example, if you look at the one over there, it literally
14:32
costs less than one laser appointment. I'm sure you guys know what this is.
14:36
It's like the laser hair removal. Uh this guy's talking about my hair has
14:40
been receding so much lately. This is a hair product for sure. Um so you
14:43
basically talk about a before and then the after um as a hook. Uh this is the
14:49
bizarre shot. So essentially anything which is weird, gross and makes you look
14:53
twice also is something which will make the customer essentially stop and stare.
14:59
So my nose looks like a strawberry. I'm guessing this is like a skin removal
15:02
product or something like that. Um so what you have to understand is the hook
15:06
has to get a sense of emotion out of your audience. It doesn't always have to
15:11
be positive. It could be negative, it could be gross, it could it just makes
15:15
needs to make them stop. Okay, so understand that. Um here is the basic
15:20
creative structure that you can have. Um essentially what I'm trying to show over
15:24
here is that out of the same creative you can make three creatives. Okay. So
15:28
let's say in the first one our hook is showing the problem. But in the second
15:32
one what I've done is I've just taken the building block from here and I've
15:36
just dragged it on top and now the before and after becomes my hook. In the
15:39
third one, I've taken the call to action from the second creative B and I've
15:44
taken into C and made my hook. So, what you have to understand is to create
15:48
different creatives, all you have to do is just drag and drop the building
15:52
blocks and you don't have to create it from scratch. And this way you can have
15:56
tens of creatives just from one master creative by just sort of dragging and
16:01
dropping uh building blocks. Now, let's talk about how do we do creative
16:07
research? How do we understand what kind of creators actually work? So you have
16:10
two places. One is Facebook ad library and the second one is Tik Tok creative
16:15
center. When you go to these places, you can find all the viral ads on Facebook
16:21
and on Tik Tok. Okay? And then what do I want to do? I want to be focusing on the
16:25
building blocks. I want to see what types of hooks and shorts they use. I
16:29
want to notice any variations. So basically what I want to do is go on
16:32
that creative and break it down in this format because when I understand what
16:38
the winning creatives have then I can reverse engineer the creatives and I can
16:42
create one for myself. So let's say if I'm in the skincare niche or if I'm in
16:46
the pet niche I would go and find viral ads from here. I would break them down
16:51
into building blocks and then I will reverse engineer them and build my own
16:55
winning creative. And the fact that it's viral over here, u the chances of your
16:59
ad going viral are also super high because you've basically bro broken down
17:02
something which is already working and it's datadriven rather than you just
17:06
making up something yourself. Now what type of content should we source? Um
17:12
this was a study done by someone and it was the top 1% of
17:18
e-commerce ads in the world. Okay. And as you can see majority of them were
17:23
product demos. So 51% were product demos. Uh you had unboxing which was
17:28
like 1 and a half%. You have spokesperson anchor which is basically
17:31
someone just you know standing over here to talk about the product which is
17:35
basic. You had lifestyle so someone maybe using the product in the mall in
17:39
the shopping complex. Lifestyle ads. You had dynamic ads at 19% which is
17:43
essentially a bunch of images together when you can scroll past them. And then
17:47
you had social proof ads. So essentially people talking about your product which
17:51
could be an influencer. Right now, what should your ideal video length be for
17:56
each ad type? The one I want to focus on the most is
18:01
the product demo. Okay, which is 25 seconds. So, just for you guys, your ad
18:05
should be about that 30 secondond mark. Idally lesser, but 25 is good. And then
18:12
again, you have some for spokesperson. You can kind of ignore that. 92 seconds
18:15
is too long. Like 92 seconds is like a minute and a half. No one watches that
18:19
long. But this is what an ideal video length should be.
18:24
Now, of course, we understand what we need to do and how do we need to edit uh
18:29
sorry, frame the content. But how do we understand how do we edit it? So, what
18:33
I've done is I made this editing checklist because you want to have this
18:37
checklist before sourcing your content so that every time you get content, all
18:40
you can do is just throw it into this checklist, edit it the same way because
18:44
you know this works. Okay. Now first thing you always want to design for
18:49
sound off. Most people don't have sound on their phone is on silent. So you want
18:53
to design for sound off. So essentially for example if someone's not paying uh
18:58
attention in class and is you know scrolling their phone right now they
19:01
should be able to see the ad because there is no audio right. So you always
19:05
design for sound off which is essentially you can have all these texts
19:08
these emojis these everything which is like okay if I don't hear anything I can
19:12
still understand what's really going on in the ad. The next thing is you want to
19:15
be using split screens and grids. I really like this because in 1 second I
19:21
can show two things. Okay, with a split screen or over here in 1 second I can
19:26
show so many things happening together because you have to understand I have
19:30
limited time. I have limited real estate and if I can show more in less time that
19:34
makes it easier for me to convert the person. Right now this is the 1.5 second
19:40
rule. Extremely extremely important. This is key, guys, because what this
19:45
basically means that every 1.5 seconds, something needs to happen in your
19:50
creative. It could be a transition, it could be a movement, it could be text
19:53
changes. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to play one of these creatives to
19:57
show you guys how it should look. Um, and just notice every 1.5 seconds, um,
20:03
something is going to happen in this ad. So, yeah, let's just play this quickly.
20:28
Cool. So, I'm going to play this one more time and literally every 1.5 second
20:32
just notice what's going on. It's the slight changes, but you'll notice every
20:35
1.5 seconds you can literally count. Cool. So, as you guys saw, every 1.5
21:02
seconds it was a transition. Um, something or the other was happening and
21:06
that is key. So, whenever you do make your creative, review it yourself and
21:10
ask yourself, is something happening every 1.5 seconds? And that is a way of
21:14
making your creative extremely engaging. Now let's talk about the editing
21:18
checklist. So you design for the first frame. Um what is the first frame
21:23
anyone? Okay. So like let's say I'm scrolling
21:31
and then I see okay so what's
21:36
okay? No I'm asking what it is not what it
21:41
does. What is what is it? So okay what is the difference between a thumbnail
21:44
and a first frame? when you scroll is the first thing that
21:49
you see in the video. Yeah. So the first frame is not the
21:53
thumbnail. The thumbnail is when you're scrolling you see like a play button and
21:57
when you click on the play button the first frame is the first frame you see
22:00
of the ad. So just to make that clear the thumbnail everyone knows what a
22:02
thumbnail is but a first frame is different. So we designed the first
22:06
frame we focused on the first second. We only use native fast clean cut
22:11
transitions. So nothing crazy. um less than 30 second always idly 15 seconds um
22:17
and check for safe space um what do I mean by safe space whenever you see real
22:22
you will always see that on the bottom over here there's going to be a the
22:26
person's profile there's going to be a like forward share you can't have it
22:29
there let me show you guys like um over here for example if if you ever see a
22:34
real on on Tik Tok or on on Instagram you're going to see the profile picture
22:38
here and then you're going to have like forward share this is not the safe space
22:42
this is the safe space. So, always optimize for that. So, here's the first
22:46
frame design, guys. In 1 second, you kind of get an idea of what this product
22:50
is going to talk about. Okay. Um, so this is what you want to do. You want to
22:53
design for first frame always. And then you want to be split testing different
22:58
things. So, you've got multiple kinds of ads. You've got no talking demo. So, for
23:02
example, she's showing you a hair curler, but she's not going to be
23:06
talking about it. It's just going to be a no talk demo. Um, there's another one
23:10
which is like how I do this. So let's say how I curl my hair in seconds, how I
23:14
do my eyeliner. There's also watch this like watch this trick. The moment you
23:18
use something like that as a hook, people get curious. People like what is
23:21
the trick about and then therefore they watch your uh ad. The next thing, three
23:27
reasons. Three reasons why you need to blah blah blah buy this product. Um
23:31
shopping hall. I went to this website and I found so much to I don't know
23:35
again shopping hall. How I do this? So like you know like tutorial videos on
23:39
how I basically use the product. That's a hook. Um, these ones work really well,
23:43
too. So, essentially, like my curling routine, you set up a routine and then
23:47
you integrate your product in the middle. It makes it look more organic.
23:51
It's and it doesn't seem too silly. Uh, because it's very native, right? Then,
23:56
educational voiceover. So, essentially, it's like a POV of you shooting your
24:00
product and you're talking over it and you're talking and explaining what the
24:04
product does. Um, life hacks. Again, very simple, but like let's say makeup
24:08
hack, whatever hack, it's a hack. you talk about, people want to view it
24:12
because they think they're learning a hack, but they're actually going to be
24:14
sold a product after that. Okay. Now guys, I told you about a structure that
24:20
you will need to follow um to make your creatives. This is probably the most
24:24
important slide in the whole thing. Okay. This is a creative structure that
24:27
I've created for you all and I've left the guessing out of this whole thing. If
24:33
it is a 30-cond ad, I have broken it down into 3 seconds of small parts.
24:38
Okay? And I'm going to start off with everything. So everyone knows what the
24:40
hook is, correct? Then we have the problem. So hook 3 seconds. So from
24:45
second four to six or four to 7, we have a problem. Then we have a agitate which
24:50
is the pain. Then we have the intro product or authority. So we talk about a
24:54
product and we have authority. Then we talk about a feature. We talk about a
24:57
benefit. Then we talk about a use case. Then we talk about the desired end
25:01
result. Like after you use my product, how are you going to feel in the end?
25:05
Right? Then you have UGC. So like people loving your product, people whatever you
25:09
can even have faces there, you could have reviews there. So UGC
25:13
then summary problem summary solution. So you remind them of what their problem
25:17
was and then you also remind them that hey we are the solution and then you
25:21
have guarantees. So essentially try this for 60 days um and get your money back
25:26
if it doesn't work. And then the call to action which is 50% off for this week
25:32
only. This is repeatable, tested and proven, optimized and plug-and-play. You
25:36
can use the same structure for any product, any niche.
25:40
And this way you have a tested and proven structure rather than doing
25:44
things in a random way. So now what we're going to do is
25:49
who doesn't know this product? It's the face sculpting thing. I'm think I
25:53
covered this in my first lesson too. Does anyone not know what this product
25:56
is? Okay, we have one person.
26:01
Okay, so it's like the face sculptor, right? like uh the face carpeting device
26:06
which just helps you like get rid of sagging skin and stuff like that. Okay.
26:10
So, what we're going to do guys is we're going to build an ad right now.
26:15
We'll go one by one. I want a line from anyone in the crowd here. So, let's go
26:20
with the hook. What should the hook be for this product? One line.
26:33
I don't know what I'm doing. No. One one line. One line.
26:35
One line. Getting old. Get this.
26:40
Uh, getting old, get this. Okay. So, getting old is fine. Get this is more a
26:44
call to action. So, let's hook them. Let's say something.
26:46
Getting old. Yeah.
26:49
I struggle for years with this problem. This is my solution.
26:55
Uh, I struggled for years with this. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
27:03
Yeah. So, I need the I need the line. Uh,
27:06
yeah. Lift your face in less than one minute.
27:10
Okay. Before and after like show the face.
27:14
Okay. And no, what about the text? So, I know the visual. You're talking
27:18
visual, which is fine. Makes sense. Yeah.
27:20
If you have saggy face, you need to hear this and then you show.
27:24
Okay. I like that. Yeah. I can't live without this product. I
27:27
basically found this product. Okay. Are you
27:30
Yeah, I found the perfect gift for my mom.
27:34
Perfect gift for my mom. Cool. Okay. So, yeah.
27:37
There is no way this product actually works.
27:40
Okay. Yeah, that's that's a different one.
27:42
Saggy face. This product won't go to waste.
27:45
All right. Okay. Sick of looks and try this.
27:49
Cool. Cool. Okay. We've got a few, so I'm going to go with the first one.
27:51
Okay. I had someone do this, so I went with say goodbye to your double chin and
27:55
sagging skin. Okay, pretty basic. Now let's talk about the problem. Give me a
28:00
problem statement. So we say say goodbye to your double chin and sagnus king. And
28:04
then what do we say next? Problem anyone?
28:15
Okay. Are you struggling with this for years? All right.
28:19
Okay. You know, I would actually use that as an agitate.
28:24
You know what I mean? Like I would bring it down, but sure. Okay. Anyone for
28:27
problem? I always struggle with feeling that.
28:37
Yeah. Okay. So, I always struggle with whatever problem. Cool. So, I'm going
28:41
with problem. Double chins make people look older than their age.
28:46
All right. Now, let's go agitate. Someone's uh how can we press on this
28:51
problem even more? How do we really like manifest that into the person's mind on
28:56
let's say a double chin and sagging skin? Let's go agitate line one line
29:00
anyone. I think that there
29:10
Yeah. So visuals I know you guys will get. I'm talking about what is the line
29:13
like what is the one line? What is the voice over going on
29:25
more of an expression more than a Okay. So I know so so okay guys. So the
29:30
visuals are going to be happening in the back right now. Now we're looking for
29:33
lines so that you can you can play a similar visual. Okay. I go I went for
29:36
this. Do you want the best skin of your life today? Question mark. Okay. Not
29:40
tomorrow, not day after, not the month later. Do you want it today? Cool.
29:44

30:05
So, get yours today because we don't want them to buy in a month. We want to
30:10
buy right now and then shop now. Cool. So, this is how we build the entire ad.
30:15
And this would be like 30 seconds. Now, what what we're going to do is we are
30:19
going to do this live in class, guys. So, you have to draft one creative
30:23
script for your winning product. Okay? We're going to hand out some sheets
30:27
right now to everyone and everyone writes one creative script for your
30:31
winning product. You have 15 minutes and then I'm going to be going through um
30:35
some of them. So, let's go. Sit with your teams, of course.
30:51
No way. We have a You have the same product. Which one is
30:54
it? the lifting thingy, but it's from another brand. It doesn't look the same
30:58
as that. Is it still Is it still saturated? Is it
31:01
Is there too much saturation now? Or should we continue with this one?
31:04
Which one? Wait, you want to see?
31:06
Well, ours is a red light one. Ours is red light.
31:08
I just open it. Isn't it? Wasn't this one red light,
31:11

31:13
change the brightness. Yeah, it can also change the color of
31:16
skin. You have the You have the blue and the
31:18
green, too. Ours is red and black.
31:20
Someone was talking about blue and green.
31:22
You want to see your website, bro? I did not sleep to do this, so I really hope
31:26
Let's Let's Let's script the thing first and then I'll review it. Yeah. Yeah.
31:29
Yeah. Oh, we fulfilled an orange sale.
31:32
Nice. $159.
31:34
Sweet. How long did it take you to get the
31:38
first sale? My first sale?
31:40
First sale? Nine days.
31:43
Like like you drop shipping started a business nine days.
31:47
Yeah. Because I didn't have anyone telling me all this, right? I was just
31:49
like on my own watching YouTube organic sale. No ads.
31:55
What? What product did you sell?
31:58
Um, it was like an apparel brand. So like hoodies and like
32:03
referral brand that you made. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
32:05
Before these 90 days, you built a brand on Instagram or something.
32:08
No, just posted a few posts and then uh I didn't know organic. No one told me
32:13
organic. Organic didn't even exist back then. Everyone was like [ __ ] doing
32:16
ads, you know. So, did you make like a a picture of the
32:19
thing and like a digital version of it? You didn't cuz you didn't have the
32:21
physical product by then, did you? I just made like designs. I also asked
32:25
my supplier for some pictures and I took the pictures from him and like edited it
32:29
on Photoshop and boom, just started posting it. You know, you
32:31
bought it. So, you you made the sale and then you went to the supplier and made
32:34
that product specifically for them. No, the designs I I I I hired a graphic
32:39
designer and I had these 20 designs done beforehand which went
32:44
Why do you think it was going to work? What made you think this product was
32:46
going to win, man? I had no I had no clue.
32:48
You just wanted to try something. I I was like, I I need to be passionate.
32:51
I need to I need to wear the product that I sell because I was wearing [ __ ]
32:54
like that then. And how long did you do this for?
32:57
How long did you How long did you do this for?
33:00
What? This this specific one? The product? Yeah.
33:02
Um like 5 months and I sold the business. I told you
33:05
someone just randomly It did pretty well. We were doing like nothing crazy.
33:08
Like $10,000 a month. Yeah. It's not bad for a first one. And
33:11
when you have no idea. How old are you at this point?
33:14
Um I was 23. Okay.
33:19
Yeah. And what got you into jobs?
33:22
I just had a guy friend of mine who was sitting next to me. Uh I had a job which
33:25
I didn't like very much and then I had a friend of mine sitting next to me and
33:28
you know that scene from Wolf of Wall Street when he goes up to decap like
33:31
what do you really do and this guy was used to do Amazon FBA and he was making
33:36
[ __ ] ton of money. Okay. Like in that time like
33:40
do you understand like Indian currency a little bit? No. So he was making three
33:44
lakhs which is like um 3 and a half grand us. Not bad a
33:50
month. He's in India.
33:51
Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing.
33:52
Yeah. So he was three and a half grand a month, right?
33:54
Um and when you spend in India that's a lot of more money.
33:57
So like I went up to and he was just like working on his own like one man
34:00
team and I was like and like just typing away and making money and chilling and I
34:03
was like what the [ __ ] do you do? And he's like oh I do Amazon drop ship uh
34:06
FBA and I was like cool. I got interested because I didn't have money.
34:10
Then I couldn't afford to get Amazon stock because you need stock and I'm
34:14
like stock like you need to buy inventory.
34:16
So I was like okay what's the next best alternative and then I got introduced to
34:19
drop shipping because then I was like okay you don't need any product you can
34:21
just like um ship from here to here and that's how I started.
34:25
Wow. Just started watching some random ass
34:27
courses on YouTube like every like there were like problems that you will get an
34:32
answer from me in like a second. I wasted months on when I say months like
34:37
3 4 months I got wasted on uh on the same thing. Um but then again like it
34:42
was about like once I got it I was like just got obsessed with it and then yeah
34:46
that was that was that. Are you grateful you started with
34:47
apparel? I started with apparel but I got done
34:50
within like four five months because I understood an apparel company is a
34:53
nightmare because there's like one product five sizes five colors. So
34:59
the stock keeping unit for just one product is crazy because if I'm just
35:02
selling uh this then it's just this you know so I was like screw I'm going to go
35:07
into something different and then I just sold everything you can think of
35:09
gardening kids jewelry uh pregnancy I sold everything.
35:15
Do you believe you have a sustainable source of income right now?
35:17
Oh yeah of course. Yeah. Do you see yourself owning the
35:20
business that you are sustainably owning income from for like a long time? Yeah.
35:23
Yeah. That's the only way I can spend like 5 hours in a university giving
35:27
lectures while I have money sprinting at the back, you know? There's no way
35:30
business works like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The thing is like we
35:34
it's not one source of income. It's multiple sources now. So like I have
35:38
like six or seven sources of income. Of course, you got your primary ones.
35:42
Uh and then you got of course the other ones.
35:45
And looking at our business and what we're all doing right now, the dynamic
35:48
of our team because you spoke to us a few times.
35:50
Yeah. Sure.
35:54
I mean like what do we focus on?
36:00
What you want to focus on and this is what I covered in my first class when I
36:03
got in here is the art of selling online.
36:06
Okay. Once you master the art of selling
36:08
online, trust me, you won't even know where you're going to use this in the
36:12
rest of your life. I use the same thing to build my personal brand. I build the
36:15
same thing. I use the same thing to build my edtech company. Drop shipping.
36:18
Obviously, I'm building a D2C brand right now. It's just that you know how
36:22
people say if you can sell you can sell. Like we're not but we are like 21st
36:26
century salesmen. We're not going door tod door. We're selling out of this
36:30
which is even better. So the art of selling online is what drop shipping
36:34
teaches you. Now do you want to be drop shipping for the rest of your life? Of
36:36
course not. Am I? Of course not. But it's a great
36:40
lowrisk u less barrier to entry low barrier to
36:44
entry business. start with learn how to sell online and then take that skill set
36:47
of learning how to sell online and then you can go build SAS AI products
36:50
anything you want because the fundamentals don't change man it's
36:53
organic content it's Facebook ads it's how to build a website this is now used
36:58
everywhere you want so it's not about selling this sales sc
37:03
it's like okay if I can track this I can use the same fundamentals and use across
37:07
the board have you ever paid for like placed
37:11
Google ads like for some sort of liquor product
37:13
no no no so essentially Because think of it this way like we are into impulse
37:18
buying and Google is search traffic. When someone's searching for something
37:22
it's a very different kind of product versus when someone is the kind of stuff
37:25
we're selling is like quirky. It's like uh it's like impulse. You know what I
37:29
mean? Now am I saying that impulse cannot also
37:32
be search? Sure. But I'll give you u I have just started running Google ads
37:37
this year after like 6 years because now I'm like cool. I understand Meta. I
37:42
understand now we're going Amazon. We're going Google, but Meta is more than
37:46
enough, man. Like, you can do a million dollars a month in sales just through
37:50
this platform. Have you ever hit a million a month?
37:52
Yes, I have. Um, and it happens in Q4 during the November, October month.
37:59
We were doing over 40 grand a day. Yeah.
38:04
Yeah. By the way, I was creating a podcast

with Alan. I don't know if you know, not this Alan, the Alan. And then basically
38:13
we're inviting like the professors, the teachers that just wants to like talk.
38:16

38:27
just want to like have a Fair enough. Let me know when. Let me

40:11
Now, where are some of the craziest places you've gone to through like
40:15
a university? Yeah. One one second. I think these guys
40:17
have question. I'm generally confused on how to do
40:23
this. No. So, like if you go here, this is
40:31
this was for a skin product. Yeah. Now, whatever your product is, you
40:34
got to just put it into this format and just do it.
40:38
Yes. Yeah. So, yeah. Take a picture. No, no, I'm going to keep this on the
40:42
screen now. So, just you can go and have a look at it.
40:45
Yes. One line like hook one line problem one line it one line
40:49
and then tell like write the line. Yes. Yes. Yes. Cool. Awesome.
41:01
You need a payment.
41:22
Huh? I think you have to direct that to them
41:30
because I have no I have no oversight on this.
41:50
first quarter million is huge.
42:10
Yeah, it's huge. I agree. I agree. You aim try and aim high. So even if you
42:17
fall short, good luck.
42:26
Yeah, sorry. You were saying where are some of the craziest places
42:28
you've gone to like your life? China. I think China was crazy for me. I
42:34
stayed there for about 2 months. How did you do that? Uh I went for this
42:38
uh to meet my suppliers and I went for like this canton fair. It's like
42:42
essentially um the biggest trade fair in the world. So I just went there, met a
42:48
lot of suppliers. Just wanted to really understand what China is like because I
42:51
always heard it's a different world and it is like everything there from even
42:56
everything there from booking. So everything's banned. There's no Google,
42:59
there's no Uber, everything is banned. Uh everything is in Chinese. So unless
43:03
you know how to read that, which you don't. The food is a problem. I would
43:07
say I'm not not vegetarian, but I'm I eat pretty much everything, but quite a
43:12
few things over there questionable in terms of uh you couldn't tell. So, you
43:16
could see a broth and you could see rice. Now, you don't know what's inside
43:18
that. And it's written Chinese, so you had to go and go with Google Translate
43:22
and like so it was super challenging. Um,
43:26
and I would say it was crazy, but in a good way. I think it was a good
43:29
experience. Yeah. Yeah.
43:32
What are some like what were you like when you were younger? What were you
43:35
like? How old are you now?
43:38
How old do I look? 26 or 24?
43:41
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 26.
43:42
I'm 30. 30.
43:43
Yeah. I just I just turned 30 last month.
43:46
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
43:48
You're very accomplished. I mean, I'm I mean I I again if I if I
43:52
go into that chain of thought that I could do better, but I I think I
43:55
practice gratitude. So, I'm like cool. I'm I'm happy where I am. Uh but am I
43:59
content? No. So, of course, I have bigger dreams. Um and I'm going for it.
44:03
What are some of your biggest dreams right now?
44:07
Like uh in a in a financial way or like let's hear both.
44:12
I don't know man. I want to be by 40. Yeah, that's that's the plan. Um in
44:18
terms of like what what my dream has been professionally like I started drop
44:23
shipping five or six years back and very early on I understood that eventually to
44:27
build a really sustainable business you have to build a brand.
44:30
So now I'm I'm in that process where I'm trying to build a very large scale
44:35
brand. Um and everything that I've done in the last 5 years has prepared me to
44:39
come to this very moment to play the Olympics.
44:42
You know what I mean? Like Olympic Olympics.
44:44
No, come on man. Get the point. The Olympics
44:48
of business, right? So it's like the last four, five
44:50
years has been practice and where you fail, you do well, you go
44:54
back and there, you know, the times you want to quit and now it's Olympic time.
44:59
So I'm playing the Olympics literally. So I'm living the dream in some sense
45:02
because I'm building the brand I always wanted to. I have great co-founders. I
45:06
have great partners. I have great I have a great team. We almost like everything
45:10
combined we have like 100 people in the team. Um so it's a good place to be in.
45:15
Now it's all about um you know how they say if you if an
45:19
airplane is going a certain way and even if it changes 4°
45:23
it goes another it's it's going to another country alltogether. So now it's
45:26
just about getting the the hard work, the the hustle, the grind is done. I was
45:30
doing that for the last 5 6 years. It was like in a whole 12 14 hours a day.
45:36
Do I am I saying I don't work hard anymore? Of course I do. But it's more
45:39
of working smart and doing making the right calls.
45:42
Yeah. Cool. I think uh you've delegated the
45:49
time. Okay. Um,
45:59
nice. Where's the product page? So, most of your traffic is going to go
46:03
on the product page, which is this.
46:07
Yeah. I still clean.
46:10
Yeah. Yeah. So, like it looks clean. I like the whole minimalist vibe. Uh, I
46:13
want to go for more social proof like maybe the reviews in the end. And I want
46:17
to go for maybe a few more sections like how So, I spoke about discrediting the
46:21
competition. Like right.
46:23
So like essentially take a [ __ ] on the normal mouse
46:26
and say us versus them. You know what I mean? I want to have that section here
46:30
like you know the chart which says we have green takes and they have all
46:32
crosses like the comparison. That section over here. Um otherwise
46:37
yeah it looks good. It looks clean. Um air mouse maybe have your brand name on
46:43
top. Maybe like Aluna air mouse. Yeah but good guys. I like it. It's clean.
46:47
But now again this is one part of the journey and the second part I would say.
46:50
First part is getting this right which is the content.
46:53
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
46:55
Cool. Thanks. Okay guys, let's uh let's wrap up and I
47:11

So guys, uh, guys over there in the corner.
54:55
Good. Can we just start again? So I hope this kind of helped you get a
55:00
good understanding of how to write the a high converting creative. We're not
55:05
going to use or leave anything to guessing. We're going to be following
55:09
this. I will repeat this is this whole thing is like 30 seconds long. Okay. So
55:15
now again we've spoken about content creation but
55:21
how do we source this content? Where do we get it from? So let's talk about how
55:24
do we get this content from? Uh we're going to be talking about creating your
55:28
production toolbox, content outsourcing solutions and what is the outreach
55:33
strategy? How do you reach out to influencers if you want them to create
55:36
this content? Okay. Um so here's the production toolbox. You need your ad
55:40
types and building blocks. create a brief uh a reference library and you
55:45
need ad usage right elements. Now here's the problem with outsourcing solutions.
55:51
It's a hit or miss with quality. It's hard to rely on scale and you have no
55:56
control over flexibility. Right? Um so this is how you would this is the kind
56:00
of equipment you would need guys. It's just an iPhone, maybe a tripod and some
56:04
lighting. Uh that's all you need. Here are some uh product shots. You have
56:09
unboxing. You have a product closeup and this is how it would look.
56:15
Go back. Go back. Is the product just not at the door? Product door.
56:19
Yeah. The thing is actually once you click on it, it opens the ad. So I think
56:22
it's the black screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. So here are some solutions
56:28
you guys can use. Uh here are some tools. You can read them out yourself.
56:31
But I use these tools for different reasons for my outsourcing solution.
56:36
Okay. So, for example, you've got uh Constant Creative, you've got Launch
56:41
Ads, you've got Harmon Brothers. Uh excuse me, guys. Yeah. Can we be silent,
56:45
please? All right. So, we've also got platforms
56:53
like Below and Influy where you can go and hire influencers, pay for them, and
56:57
then they all you have to do is just send the product out and you get the
57:01
content. Now, here's the outreach strategy. What do you really say to your
57:05
influencer? Right? We want this to be simple but at the same time streamlined.
57:10
Um let's understand our main goal. Our main goal is to source content from them
57:16
so we can use it in Facebook ads. And our secondary goal is to get revenue
57:20
once they post. I'll repeat, the main goal is to get content. And the
57:25
secondary goal is sales. I honestly wouldn't care too much if I get no sales
57:30
after them posting, but as long as I can get the content, I can then use it for
57:33
ads and therefore I can make more money with the with the ads that I have. Right
57:37
now, here's the process plus automation. Find the right influencer by filtering
57:42
them through a KPI test. Um, you want to send them guidelines because you don't
57:46
want them to basically do things themselves. So, send them a guideline on
57:50
how your content should be. Uh, you also want to send them the script. So, for
57:53
example, you all made a script right now. uh you don't want the influencer to
57:57
basically just say whatever they want. You want to send them an exact script to
58:01
like literally memorize and read out of um because you understand the market way
58:05
better than they would. I could also do it two ways. Let's say if I source two
58:08
pieces of content, I will give them freedom for one. So I'll be like make
58:12
whatever you want, keep it original and the second one is my script which is
58:16
essentially something that I have um created after a lot of data that I had.
58:21
You also want to be creating SOPs for recording. So a lot of people don't have
58:25
the right like they'll record it with maybe bad lighting. We don't want that.
58:28
So we want standard operating procedures for this. Now let's do an example here.
58:33
Okay. Let's say it's a beauty hair brand. I would create an influencer
58:37
persona. So someone who is enthusiastic about her appearance. She has a very
58:41
loyal following. Um and here are some of the things which are dues. So the girl
58:46
must have nice straight hair. She must be 15 to 30 whatever active followers.
58:51
Um, okay. Um, okay, cool. So, here are some
58:56
of the dos, but let's talk about the don'ts. So, no fan page accounts, no
59:00
verified accounts, celebrities, public figures, because these guys are going to
59:03
charge you a bomb. So, don't even um yeah, waste your time messaging them. Uh
59:08
because they probably won't even reply to you, okay? Um and then no accounts
59:11
that are strictly of one type of post. So, like, no, I only eyebrows, only
59:15
fashion, only makeup. I don't want to be getting content from that person if I'm
59:19
doing this for a hair brand. Now, this would be a kids brand for an example.
59:23
So, it's basically a micro influencer mommy who has a cute kid. Uh, it's in
59:28
the US, has a US accent. They should be active on Instagram. They should have a
59:32
good video presence. And the age of the kid should be 1 to 3 years old. And the
59:38
the mom in this case should be a micro influencer. So, someone who has less
59:42
than 10,000 followers. And the reason for that is these people are usually
59:45
fine with just getting the product. They don't charge you any money. And I also
59:49
feel like someone who's just starting out is more passionate about creating
59:52
content. So you can really get some really good content out of them. And
59:55
then their engagement rate, followers don't mean anything. Engagement rate is
59:59
important. So more than 2%. How do you find that? There's a tool on top, not
1:00:03
just analytics.com. Go there, paste the Instagram profile of the influencer and
1:00:07
you will get an approximate of the engagement rate. Okay? So we care about
1:00:11
engagement. So let's filter bad versus uh good
1:00:16
profile. like this is a good profile because let's say u the girl has great
1:00:20
style and hair um the engagement is uh ideal and this is what a bad profile
1:00:27
would look like because let's say in this case low engagement only posts
1:00:31
product photos she's not posting anything with the face it's only like
1:00:34
POV shots um so I would exclude these kind of profiles this is so important
1:00:39
guys because if you do not source the right influencer you get the wrong
1:00:42
content you get the wrong content you burn money on ads which equals to no
1:00:45
sales So filtering the right influencer is
1:00:48
super important and this is how you do it. Now here are some guidelines. For
1:00:52
example, this is what the shoot should look like and this is a bad example. So
1:00:57
let's say the do is take the nice photo in soft lighting and don't shoot in
1:01:01
harsh lighting. This is part of your influencer guide. So you're going to be
1:01:05
sending them this one-page document which is a guideline. So basically
1:01:09
that's going to include the location, deliverables, requirements, video brief,
1:01:13
and video structure. So let's say the deliverables are we want two videos and
1:01:18
we want photos. Okay. And then we also give them example videos like we want
1:01:22
the shoot to be like this. Here are some of the requirements. It should be HD. It
1:01:27
should be shot in some well-lit location. And then again you can read
1:01:30
this out but this is going to be a document that you send your influencer.
1:01:33
You don't want to give it give the influencer too much freedom and you want
1:01:36
to make sure that you get the right quality.
1:01:39
Now here's the video structure. I've literally spelled out what she has to
1:01:43
say. Hey, I used to always struggle with creating waves, blah blah blah, and then
1:01:47
I use this product. I want to literally spell it out for the influencer and have
1:01:52
this script ready before uh I sell it. So, they can say stuff like, "I love it.
1:01:57
It's super quick and easy." Blah, blah, blah. This this is an entire script that
1:02:01
I send to the influencer before I start um sourcing content.
1:02:06
Can you go back? Yeah.
1:02:10
Cool. Now, how do you out do outreach to the influencer? Like, how do you reach
1:02:15
out to them? So, this is literally a screenshot that I've taken from one of
1:02:18
my brand accounts. So, let's say there's this influencer called Amanda, and we
1:02:21
just messaged her and said, "Hey, I hope you're doing well. We'd love to send you
1:02:24
one of our products." She's like, "Thank you so much." Um, then we're like,
1:02:28
"Here's the product. Uh, here's what you need, what we need from you. One IG
1:02:32
post, one IG story." Then she's like, "Perfect. Thank you." I'm like,
1:02:35
"Awesome. We'll send you some specific details. Uh, blah blah blah. we need a
1:02:39
video from a kido a kiddo. Uh and then again the whole chat I'm not going to
1:02:42
read the whole thing. Um but here we're trying to basically yeah talk to her
1:02:47
again. We're like for sure we don't want it looking like an ad either. So we were
1:02:50
like we want something more organic. We don't want you to create an ad. And
1:02:54
there was a time when she was again asking us for a certain uh fee or money
1:02:59
for it. So we were like we're trying to work with content creators on a monthly
1:03:02
basis. So if all goes well we would love to tie up with you for the next 3 to 6
1:03:06
months. So which basically means let's start and if it works well, if the
1:03:10
content does well with our audience, then we will get you on a monthly
1:03:12
retainer. But for now, all we can do is just send you the product. So basically
1:03:16
get it for free. Uh you guys can literally copy paste this message and
1:03:20
like send it to the person that you're trying to tie up with.
1:03:24
Now then I also get her into a revenue sharing model because I'm I'm like, "Oh,
1:03:29
almost forgot. Got an extra offer for you as well. Well, if you want to earn
1:03:32
some extra cash, put this discount code, Amanda 20, into the post so that people
1:03:36
could use it and check out and get 20% off. And she gets 50% of sales from that
1:03:42
discount code. So, if she does a $100,000, uh, sorry, okay, $1,000, then
1:03:46
she gets $500 as a proper profit share. Um, and then she's like, "Perfect.
1:03:52
You're welcome. Thank you." Um, and yeah, here's the deal structuring, guys.
1:03:55
So, most micro influencers like Amanda will be happy with a free product. they
1:04:00
won't ask for money. Try negotiating this by promising them monthly retainers
1:04:04
once um you do see a good fit. And yeah, that's pretty much it in terms of like
1:04:10
um what you want to do in the end is build relationships and talk about
1:04:14
future collaborations. So, she sent a video over here and then we were like,
1:04:17
"This video is super cute and thank you so much." And then we build
1:04:21
relationships and future collaborations. Right
1:04:26
now, this is important. Once she publishes the post, here are the things.
1:04:30
Uh, excuse me, guys. Yeah. Good. So, here's the things you want to analyze.
1:04:35
The CTR, which is the click-through rate, cost per click, number of sales
1:04:39
that you got, number of likes, comments, reposts, and numbers of new followers
1:04:43
you got in the first 24 hours after she made the post. You want to be tracking
1:04:47
this across all influencers on a sheet, right? Uh then what you want to do is
1:04:53
let's say you tie over 20 influencers. All 20 are not going to work. Maybe
1:04:57
three or five work. And then you want to identify the high performers. You want
1:05:01
to cut the low performers and you want to keep working with the high performers
1:05:05
on a weekly monthly basis. And that way your content is sorted for a long long
1:05:10
time because now you have people who I don't know like they just are uh your
1:05:14
audience likes them. And it's it's you'll see like uh there'll be times
1:05:18
when you'll see an influencer and you're going to be like this person's going to
1:05:21
do really well, but you'll be surprised and the other person does well. So you
1:05:23
really have to put it to the test. Um so you continue working with high
1:05:27
performing influencers and you even get them on a retainer. Let's say you pay
1:05:30
them $100 every month and they are now giving you content on a weekly basis and
1:05:34
this way it sorts you out in terms of content, right? Um so the conclusion the
1:05:38
problem is high cost per acquisition and the solution is you set up datadriven
1:05:44
systems to produce source test and it trade ad creatives on a weekly basis. Um
1:05:51
for everyone who's worried that you know my product will stop selling the only
1:05:55
way it doesn't stop selling is if you have new creatives in the engine coming
1:05:58
in every week because products don't get saturated. Sometimes it's the creative
1:06:03
which gets saturated so you just have to come up with new ones. So yeah guys,
1:06:06
that's it for today. I hope you guys liked it uh and enjoyed today's lesson.
1:06:10
And yeah, thank you.
Email Marketing
24/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM

0:00
Awesome. How's everyone doing? Good.
0:04
Awesome. So, today's um lesson is going to be how to write very high converting
0:12
emails for your business. I see a lot of people ignoring this because emails are
0:17
boring, but emails make you a lot of money if you do them right. And guess
0:21
what? The good thing about emails is, what's the good thing about emails?
0:26
They're free. So it doesn't cost you anything to send an email. Um
0:31
essentially like for example guys, guys over there, attention please.
0:38
So if you run ads for example, it's going to cost you money to run ads. But
0:41
in the case of emails, it's free. So I just want to show you some like results
0:46
that we were able to get with one of our drop shipping businesses. So in 3
0:51
months, we did about $800,000 in just 3 months. and $190,000 were just emails.
0:58
Okay? So all this money is free money because I did not pay for the customer.
1:04
I just sent the email and therefore we're going to be speaking about those
1:08
things right now. Um so what is that like more than 20% of the money made was
1:14
through emails, right? And again these were automated emails. I wasn't manually
1:18
sending these emails out. I was automating my flows, which I'm going to
1:22
teach you guys today on how to automate the flow and therefore get the email.
1:27
This was just December, by the way. So, two $290,000 in December. We made 65k
1:32
just sending emails. Um, so again, I'm just stressing on the fact that uh do
1:37
not ignore emails because uh you're going to be spending on ads, you're
1:40
going to be spending on multiple things, but if you get an email base and you can
1:43
really target these customer customers well, then you can make 22% or even all
1:48
the way up to 30% of your money um through emails. A lot of you right now
1:53
haven't got your payment processing, but you have your websites up, you're
1:57
creating content. So, what I would say is start collecting emails, right?
2:00
because when you do go live, you can send them an email saying, "Hey, we're
2:03
live. Let's go shop or come shop, whatever." So, let's get down to what
2:08
we're going to be using for emails, guys. So, the software we're going to be
2:12
using is called Clavio. Anyone heard of it?
2:15
Okay, one person. Cool. So, Clavio is what we're going to be using for uh our
2:20
emails, correct? And here's how we set it up. It's pretty simple. We sign up,
2:26
we connect to Shopify, we set up tracking, and then we import our
2:30
contacts if we have any. In this case, we won't have a lot of contacts because
2:34
you guys are just starting out. Um, but this is how it looks. Just for context,
2:38
this is how Clavio looks, guys. So, you have uh on the left you have your home,
2:42
then you have your campaigns, flows, signup forms. We're going to go through
2:46
each one of them today. U but I'm just showing you how the interface looks.
2:49
Once you log in and sign up, this is what you're going to be seeing as the
2:52
screen on Clavio. So next thing um yeah here are some of the flows and series
3:00
that you guys have to set up. Now the the the one on the top welcome series is
3:05
going to make you the most amount of money. Okay and then it's going to be
3:09
abandoned card. So welcome series is basically introducing new subscribers
3:13
with a discount and abandoned card is a series where you basically just um send
3:19
a bunch of emails to people who have left their product in their cart. So
3:22
abandoned card. Then you have post-purchase which is you thank
3:25
customers after they've bought from you and therefore it's a thank you to
3:29
customers and you again sell to them again or try to get them back. Win back
3:33
series is when you're basically trying to re-engage any inactive customers. So
3:37
let's say someone's not been engaging with us for the last 30 60 days. I want
3:41
to win them back. Therefore I send this series. And then there's a bunch of
3:45
other stuff which I'm going to be covering. Um but you just really have to
3:49
focus. So all that money that I showed you right now, 90% of it was made from
3:53
the welcome series and abandoned car. Just two flows, okay? So just focus on
3:56
the first two. Again, the others are also important, but if you get the two
3:59
right, I think that's pretty much enough. So here's how you set up your
4:04
campaigns, guys, and flows. So you see the flow on flows section on the the
4:08
third one from the top. And the moment you click on flows, you're going to see
4:11
all these flows over here. These are already made. So these are customuilt
4:15
templates. You just have to click on one and you can already set it up with your
4:19
Shopify. Um, and here's how you first set up the signup form. So, you guys see
4:24
this signup form, right? It's on every website you go on. It's this is how we
4:28
collect emails. So, the moment the customer lands on our website, this form
4:32
pops up and then we can design this form based on our brand palette or the way
4:36
you want it with your logo, etc. And then what you can do is get the email in
4:40
and then once the email is submitted, then the flow starts that I just showed
4:43
you, the welcome series flow. So a bunch of emails going out in an automated
4:47
manner. So in terms of setting it up, you want to be uh navigating to the
4:53
signup form which is um if you see the one the fourth one from uh the top on
4:58
the left. So you go on sign up forms and then you essentially create separate
5:03
forms for mobile and desktop because again you will Yeah.
5:07
So we've used private before but there's a small issue with it. Okay. I
5:11
personally seen is that it takes two load on you have any suggestions on how
5:16
to make faster uh to like with the form.
5:19
Yeah. Okay. So
5:23
I've seen it takes like 30 seconds. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to come to
5:25
that. So I'm going to I'm going to come to that. So how to basically decide when
5:30
you want the form to pop up. It's up to you. Okay. I'm going to show you that.
5:33
Next thing you do is you choose a template. You can choose a template for
5:36
your form and then you can also customize your form. Right? Right. So
5:40
you can essentially um have a 10% discount. You can add any images and
5:45
text also in the form. Now you can also choose the style and
5:51
branding. So you guys did make a brand palette for your business. So you want
5:54
to choose the same colors also in your form and create the form accordingly. Um
6:00
this is how the form looks. This is a very basic one by the way. Um you can
6:03
set it up yourself based on what you want to write. Um and here is when so
6:08
okay you were talking about the time delay right over here you can actually
6:11
decide how after how many seconds will the form pop up
6:14
even when it's zero time I don't know I mean maybe it's the
6:18
website then in your case so is there any difference
6:22
heavy what's your loading uh speed time
6:26
it's quite fast really fast
6:31
I can have a look at it after class but like I've been using clavio for the last
6:34
six years so this is the best automation tool for emails. We have omnisend also,
6:39
but I prefer Clavio because uh yeah, it just the features are pretty cool. But
6:42
anyway, let's go. So, once you set up the form, here are some of the options
6:46
that you get. For example, you can choose the style of the form. You can
6:49
choose how it looks on desktop, how it looks on mobile. You can also decide
6:54
after how much time do you want the form to pop up. Any guesses on how long we
6:59
should wait for the perform to pop up like in terms of seconds or minutes like
7:02
how long should the like we set this time delay to? Anyone? Yeah.
7:12
Okay. 5 10 seconds. Cool. Anyone else? How long do you think it should take for
7:17
the Sorry. 30 seconds. Okay. So, zero. Okay. So,
7:22
you do What type of form is like a discount
7:24
code? Yeah, this one. this form, how long
7:27
should it take for it to pop up into into the website? You know,
7:31
zero seconds. Zero seconds. Okay, so we have 0 30 and
7:34
over 10 over there. Again, there's no wrong answer here, but I personally
7:39
don't want the form to pop up too early because the guy's just landed on our
7:43
website. He's checking things out. Maybe he buys without the discount. So, I
7:47
don't want to give a discount to person who's buying with a discount. You know
7:50
what I mean? So, I usually like to keep at least I don't know two to three
7:55
minutes before the form pops because otherwise it's intrusive. Like he's on
7:58
my landing page, he's reading uh what the USPs are and then a form pops up and
8:04
he gets busy kind of like so any friction in the buying journey increases
8:08
or rather decreases the chance of him buying. So I want some time for him to
8:11
at least see what the offering is and then for the pop-up thing to happen.
8:15
Right. The next thing is you can do is you can also add blocks to your form. So
8:19
it's a drag and drop. You can add a countdown timer, a coupon, spin to win.
8:23
You can just drag it from here and drop it onto your form somewhere here. So you
8:26
can design your form the way you want. Right now, how do you maximize email
8:31
collection? You want to create an enticing offer. So
8:34
like instead of saying 10% off, you could just say something like unlock an
8:38
exclusive discount. So this creates curiosity because he doesn't know what
8:41
discount he's going to get. Um, you want to make users feel like they're getting
8:46
a unique offer to increase perceived value, like that offer is only for them
8:50
versus this is for everyone. Correct? And again, you want to be working on
8:54
your copywriting. So, use persuasive text like, "Congratulations, you've
8:57
unlocked a mystery discount. Ready to see what you've got." So, it should be
9:01
personalized. It should be and it should be persuasive, right? Um, you can also
9:06
split test your forms, guys. So again, you want to be tracking some key metrics
9:11
like what is your email submission rate? Let's say if 100 people land on your
9:14
website, what's the percentage of people who gave in your email? And based on
9:19
that, you want to split test different things like offers, copy, designs. Um,
9:23
and you want to optimize that that more people give you um their email, right?
9:29
And then you you want to refine this over time. You want to track the metrics
9:32
like conversion, open rates, sales. Um, again, these are metrics that you can
9:38
use to improve your email flow. Again, this is another kind of form
9:43
which says pretty basic stuff like unlock 10% off, sign up to receive this
9:48
discount, and then you have a thank you screen which is thanks for signing up.
9:53
So, this is pretty um yeah, standard. You can edit this based on your brand or
9:58
the way you want it to look like. It's super super like customizable, but
10:01
that's how you do it. Now let's get to like how do we set up our welcome series
10:06
because this is the most important flow. This is the flow which makes most of the
10:10
money. Um now the trigger is when someone basically enters their email
10:17
through the form that's when the welcome series starts. The first email should
10:21
have a discount code and should introduce the brand. The second email
10:25
should share a brand story and your values. The third email should highlight
10:29
your bestsellers and reviews and then so on and so forth. and you have close to
10:33
five to seven emails going out in a span of let's say seven days. So every day
10:38
you have an email going out trying to get that person back if he hasn't bought
10:42
from you. Okay. Now guys, this is super important. Let's say you have 10 minutes
10:47
to draft an email. I would spend 5 minutes just drafting the subject line
10:52
because if the person does not open your email, then everything inside it is
10:56
basically irrelevant. So you have to be very very careful on how you draft your
11:00
subject line. Uh, so you spend 50% of your time drafting the subject line and
11:04
then the other 50% writing the email. I see a lot of people focusing on what's
11:08
inside the email, but if the subject line isn't good, then they're not going
11:11
to open the email. Therefore, your email is basically junk, right? So, spend a
11:15
lot of the time drafting subject lines. And um, there's an art to do that,
11:20
right? On how do we draft very engaging subject lines. Now, here are some of the
11:25
best practices. Keep it short. So, aim for under 45 characters. Can someone
11:29
tell me why we should keep it short? Sorry.
11:39
Okay. Yeah. Because of attention of a person like if
11:43
you grab their attention and not just Yeah. Yeah. Also, when you see like on
11:48
your Gmail app, if it's a long subject line, it's like
11:51
dot dot dot. He can't read the whole thing.
11:53
So, that's why it's 45 characters. If it's 45 characters, you can read the
11:57
whole thing in just one glance rather than clicking on the email. You want to
12:03
be using something which is um yeah, you want to be uh very clear with it. You
12:08
want to use urgency and scarcity. So like ends tonight, only three left. And
12:13
you also want to add their name. So you can personalize and you can add the
12:16
person's name. Let me um show you how to do that in the next slide. And preview
12:21
text, you know, the line which is below the subject line is called the preview
12:24
text. And usually what people do is they just use the first line of their email
12:28
as preview text. But I can you can actually customize this. So it's like if
12:32
the email subject line says something and then I have another text below which
12:36
again makes them curious to click on the email, right? Um so how do we build an
12:41
engaging welcome flow? We have offer and urgency. We have brand introduction,
12:45
product highlights, social proof and clear call to actions. Pretty basic
12:49
stuff. What I have done u is okay this is how you build the welcome series
12:54
right so what you're going to see here is um if you look at the drop the
12:58
trigger is when someone is added to the newsletter there's a conditional split
13:02
which means if the customer did buy from us then this flow starts and if the
13:07
customer didn't buy from us then this flow starts so it's conditional based on
13:11
who that person is and then you can add time delay so let's say after the first
13:15
email you want to wait 3 days and then send the second email. So, you can set
13:20
up time delays. You could make that 2 days, 1 day. I personally like an email
13:24
every day because I feel like the more you space it out, uh the chances of that
13:27
person being more engaged with you are lesser. So, I like going uh wait one
13:31
day, email two, wait one day, email 3 4 5 6 7. And that's how it goes. And this
13:36
is what the flow looks like, guys. You can drag and drop things over here
13:40
yourself. This is what you're going to be see when you build your email flow.
13:44
Yeah. Um does the software initially get the email from the discount code and
13:49
then they then we email them through that.
13:51
Yeah. So one way is that and then one way is they abandon their card. So they
13:54
have to enter their email to get to the card page to check out and therefore
13:58
that flow starts from there. So there are two ways you get emails.
14:02
But then how does it send an abandoned email notification when it doesn't have
14:06
the email to start off with? It has the email to check out. You need
14:09
the email. And then where did it get the email
14:10
from? When the customer enters the email.
14:14
while checking out on Shopify. Oh, okay. Okay.
14:17
Yeah. Uh, yeah, we have someone over here too,
14:21
I think. No, you have a question. You raised your
14:25
hand. No. Yeah. No. Okay. Okay. Guys over there,
14:29
please. Attention. Thank you. Um, so what I've done guys for you is I've
14:33
already like drafted like five emails as a welcome series. And what I've done is
14:38
I've if you click on the link, you're going to get access to this. Let's look
14:42
at the first subject line. and it just says, "Hey, first name." So, let's say
14:45
if it's Jack, it says, "Hey, Jack." We get like a 60% open rate on this. By the
14:51
way, 60% open rate is crazy. Anything above 25% is good because imagine you
14:56
get an email saying, "Hey," and it's your name. You just are like, "Who's
15:00
this person? Like, why is he saying hey?" You know what I mean? So, the
15:02
whole point of the subject line is to get the person to open the email and I
15:06
think a high first name. So, it's going to pull the first name of the customer
15:10
automatically, right? So you can just draft that and then we go to welcome to
15:14
this brand. Uh and then this is the whole template you guys can pick out.
15:18
I've basically made five emails for you guys and you can just basically copy and
15:22
paste it the links over there. But I would expect you guys to of course add
15:25
your brand tone, add anything else that you feel is relevant to the series. Um
15:30
now the abandoned card structure again super important. People who were about
15:34
to buy our product but for whatever reason didn't buy our product they left
15:38
it in their cart. How do we get these people back? Right? So, like I said,
15:43
activated when someone abandons their card. Our goal is to remind and motivate
15:48
these customers to complete the purchase with urgency, incentives, and product
15:53
highlights. So, the first email is like, did you forget something? Second email,
15:56
your card is waiting plus a little something for you. Third email, you can
16:01
use a subject line like last chance to grab your favorites. And the fourth
16:04
email is like um items are selling out only 50 pieces left. So again, this is
16:09
how your band card looks like. Again, same thing over here, guys. You got to
16:12
personalize it. Clear call to action. It should be mobile optimized because 90%
16:17
of your customers are going to be using it from mobile. So make sure it's mobile
16:20
optimized. And then use social proof. Uh again, to set up your abandoned card,
16:25
what you want to do is go on uh the flows. Then you're going to see
16:29
abandoned cards set up already. And this is how it's going to look. So like let's
16:33
say we don't wait for one day to send the abandoned card. we want to send the
16:37
abandoned card in less than 1 hour because that person is already
16:40
interested in buying the product. So I just wait 1 hour, I send an email one,
16:44
then I wait one day and I send an email two and then I send five emails across 5
16:48
days um in terms of the abandoned card. Again, I've also made five emails for
16:54
you for abandoned cards. You guys can copy and paste it. It's in the link. But
16:58
this is how it would look in terms of how the email would structure itself.
17:02
Now this is the in-class engagement guys. So, I hope you're staying with
17:05
your teams. What I want you all to do is write five subject lines in sequence
17:09
from day one to day five for your abandoned card flow. Get creative. Only
17:14
subject lines. Okay, you have 10 minutes. Let's go.
17:21
What counts as nothing
17:26
marketing? Yeah. So with our domain uh when we
17:32
registered our domain they gave us three different email like we can register
17:37
three different emails and we don't know which are like the most professional
17:42
emails that we can do you know either contact us
17:45
uh for your domain but no one gets to see that so you can just use anything no
17:50
one gets to see your email that was registered for your domain customers
17:53
can't see it no one can see it only you know what the email is so you use
17:56
anything but we want to like leave uh
17:59
oh do oh domain for like your Oh okay okay okay so like that's your domain
18:03
like com.in in are you seeing that? Yeah, we have the uncommon store.
18:10
Uncommon store. Yeah, I would I would avoid using something like a store
18:14
because it's just like think about it like any brand doesn't have a Zara store
18:19
or let's say Apple store like it looks a bit unprofessional. The store I would
18:24
just like brand.co or brand.com or brand.org O RG or brand
18:30
dot, you know what I mean? Like I would I would focus on that because anything
18:33
which has store um sounds sounds a bit unprofessional.
18:37
Okay. But which which do you recommend because
18:41
we're like debating in between having contact support?
18:47
Oh yeah, support. Uh just have one man. Just have at you know like hello at like
18:53
and that hello is for everything like uh you could have support. I usually use
18:57
support, hello, hi at like let's say if my brand name is zappy, whatever. So
19:02
it's like hi@zappy.com or contact@zappy.com.
19:05
Contact, no, I would do hi or hello or support.
19:09
Okay. And I would just use one email. Let's
19:11
not complicate it. We're not that big a company that we need like different
19:14
emails right now. Okay. So one email for everything.
19:16
Yeah. Okay.
19:17
For your customers, right? Yeah. Yeah.
19:18
Yeah. So and for the for the automations, the
19:23
customers don't see the email that it came from. No, they do. So, you want to
19:27
be using an email like uh I usually like using an email like I I
19:32
like using a name because I don't want it to look like it's come from the
19:36
company. Like let's say if my name is uh Jack, then I like going jackzappy.com
19:43
and I act like and I act and I and I so it's more personalized. It's I make it
19:48
sound like a person is sending it to me. So for these emails, the outward ones,
19:53
make it like, "Oh, I'm Jack, marketing head of brand." You know what I mean?
19:58
I'm taking or even [ __ ] it. Like just make it like I'm the founder. Like, you
20:01
know, I'm I'm I'm the founder is emailing you and they're like, "Oh,
20:04
shit." You know? Okay. Okay. Good works.
20:08
So, we can have like one for everything like hello.com
20:12
and then one like Yes.
20:14
I don't know whether Ally or anyone anyone. And that guy's like the
20:17
founder and he's like, you know, I'm really excited. And even the customer
20:20
feels, oh [ __ ] the founder is emailing me. Like they don't know it's automated,
20:22
right? But like for them it's like, oh [ __ ] like he's paying attention to just
20:26
me. They feel special. Maybe they buy from you.
20:28
Okay. Yeah. Cool.
21:01
like not all but I'll see a few today and then I'll wrap it up tomorrow.
21:16
No, I just want to understand what did we communicate to her like when we I
21:19
remember when we was finalizing the deal, we told her like okay uh here are
21:23
the things we want. What was that communication? So maybe I can then get
21:26
an idea of what we told her that we not want in the beginning.
21:45
We need to watch.
22:15
Yeah. Hey every
22:20
time as in as
22:23
I mean I if it gets repetitive I would use it once. Yeah. Yeah. The first one
22:28
should usually be the hey. Yeah. And no emoji, nothing. Like, hey, that's it.
22:33
Like, hey, first name. Yeah. Anyone?
23:45
Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. Um,
23:59
okay. You're like calling the guy out with the
24:08
first thing. It's like It's like It's like it's time
24:13
for bed. It's like the first name. Um I mean fair enough.
24:24
Did this work? You never So the thing is like you can
24:27
actually even split test subject lines and you can see which which one has
24:30
messing around with this. I wasn't being serious. This is like half real. And
24:34
then the thing is like I it's like if I if
24:37
you get a name if I get an email saying hey Sean that's it. I'm like what the
24:40
[ __ ] Who's that? So did you forget something? Still gives you context. So I
24:44
would just delete. I would just be, "Hey, Sean." I'm like, "Who the [ __ ] is
24:48
this guy?" Then I open it and I'm like, "Oh, he's" But like, at least I get my
24:51
open rate. The whole point of this is to get get the email to open. And then then
24:54
it comes down to the copyrightiting inside the email, which is like, "How do
24:57
I get this bad guy to buy from the hospital?
25:15
friendly. I also like using this one. I also like
25:20
using this one. Hey, your product has been shipped.
25:22
Ah, and he's like, I don't order anything.
25:25
Tracking number just go.
25:30
You got to be smart, you know. How did you do it?
25:35
I I was just messing around. I didn't really write anything.
25:39
Okay. Okay. I was like, "Hey, hey." And then you said, "Hey, hospital.
25:45
Mom's in the hospital. Okay.
25:48
Just a friendly reminder that you have in your car.
25:50
What do you think of these? They're coming for you. Your time has
25:53
come. Time to say goodbye. Okay. So, my my feedback is like, okay,
25:58
I usually try avoiding having um product names in the email because if I change
26:05
my product then I can't change my like I can but it's like I want to keep it
26:08
generic so it works for all the products on my store. So avoid like like again
26:12
this period thing will only work for a period product, right? So like you won't
26:15
keep it super general like like for example I I'll go with the
26:19
subject line hi that's it. Boom. Then I'll have an I I like to [ __ ] around
26:24
also. I like Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I like to [ __ ]
26:29
around also. Uh and I say something like, "Hey, your product has been
26:34
shipped." The guy's like, "What the [ __ ] I I don't Yeah. Which product?" He
26:38
clicks on it and then Yeah.
26:42
Have you had any experience using 1688 to supply
26:46
uh Chinese? Yeah. Yeah. Uh I usually use 1688 for product research
26:53
and not for actual fulfillment because those guys have some products which are
26:56
maybe not available on other websites and 1688 is like the Chinese version of
27:01
AliExpress essentially. Okay. I found I found the iron man mask on team and I
27:08
contacted the supply and he said that we actually posted office 1688 but we can
27:11
sell it because of copyright laws or something.
27:14
Who said copyright laws? Yeah, the supplier. I don't know what he
27:17
meant by that but I asked him if he can connect me with the main supplier. I
27:20
haven't got a response yet. I contacted the Xiao supplier that he
27:26
told us about. Yeah.
27:27
So I sent him a message last night. So I'll see if if I get a reply from
27:30
him. Okay. The main issue we're having is finding a
27:32
supplier for the NBA. Uh you're on the team with the Saudi
27:40
guy, right? Yeah.
27:41
Okay. Yeah, man. That product is anyway like
27:44
it has copyright issues. It has it's even if you do end up selling it,
27:49
finding it selling it and then the the chance of getting banned from Facebook.
27:54
Yeah. Because Facebook again doesn't no platform is going to be very buzzing
28:01
about people selling counterfeits, you know.
28:04
Yeah. So, how do I do it in a way that
28:07
just got to take a chance, I guess. So, how's it going?
28:10
Good, good, good. So, where do I go for the suppliers?
28:14
Because you tried Zen Drop, Dean Drop. No, for this product, you're not finding
28:18
it, but for other products, you you definitely will find
28:21
that. That's true. But we're really trying to double down on this one. You
28:23
did uh put a few listings on uh sourcing box. Did you get a reply from them?
28:29
Yeah. No, no replies. Nothing. If I don't get replies, it means uh
28:33
Yeah, it's probably not there. It's probably not there because other guys
28:35
are sourcing products from Source Box. They're getting replies. They're getting
28:38
like their product sourced pretty easily. I think because of your whole
28:42
Iron Man, Marvel, whatever the [ __ ] like copyright BS, it's it's going to be
28:46
a problem. Yeah. How would you work out?
28:51
Just go for something else, man. Let's just go for something. You guys have
28:56
other products also on the list, right? So, just go for that.
28:58
We do. But I mean, this would be something like
29:01
I know like see I even though it's a bit of a sticky thing, I still gave a go
29:04
ahead. I was like cool, let's try it. But like if it's becoming a problem, we
29:07
can't like completely like not do anything till we find that product, you
29:11
know? We're doing like I mean we have we have
29:14
no state. We have thousand other things. Fair enough.
29:19
I feel like you can start off with something else. In the meantime, keep
29:22
trying and sourcing this product. If you find it, find it. If you don't, [ __ ] it.
29:25
Like, never get married to a product. Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. You can't
29:28
get married to Yeah.
29:29
Well, I mean, so no alternatives besides Yeah. Yeah. I was just telling him even
29:35
if you end up finding it, the chances of you facing issues with Facebook, even
29:38
with your payment processor, no one likes anyone selling counterfeits as a
29:43
policy, you know, counterfeits because
29:46
I mean, whatever. Like, you're not counterfeits, but you have my point.
29:49
Like it's like it's it's a it's a it's like you're not selling a Marvel
29:52
merchandise. You're selling something of China and using their uh franchise
29:57
copyright. Amazon.
30:00
Yeah. Amazon pay must be some [ __ ] Most of the people on
30:04
Amazon are Chinese [ __ ] Okay. And those guys don't give a [ __ ] Like they
30:08
just sell anything. Now if he gets banned also he'll go back and he'll just
30:11
like have a work around. But like Yeah.
30:14
What what's killing me is that I saw a very big Emirati gaming store selling
30:19
it. A high piece store selling it and Are you sure that those guys don't have
30:25
the license for this product? I don't know. How can we acquire the
30:28
license? That's how
30:29
they don't sell this. Acquiring a license is again a longterm
30:34
thing and also an relatively expensive thing I believe.
30:37
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
30:40
Cool. Just have your options open, guys. Yeah. open face.
30:47
Cool. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Hi.
30:50
I want to know what do you think about these possible things
30:56
for the mail. Are you selling Kortas?
31:00
Yeah. Which team are you?
31:02
Drop. Okay. City in the middle.
31:07
So I usually like going for like I said when you say, "Hey, you forgot
31:11
something. It gives me context that oh it's the
31:15
same guy who's trying to sell me something. But when if I if I say hey
31:17
hey Sean that's it I'm like what the [ __ ] What do you mean by hey Sean?
31:20
Who's this person? Then it makes me curious to want to click on it. Oh
31:23
so you want to like make it more like specific about the person.
31:27
Yeah. Like I want to make it about him because then it's broad because then he
31:30
could be like oh someone's trying to email me he knows me but then he finds
31:33
out it's you. Your main job is to make him open the email. You know everything
31:36
else is can happen in the copyrightiting once the email is open. And also I'm
31:41
doing two other projects myself. It's very quite hard but I'm also trying to
31:47
uh I also want to work with nails. But this company is going to be basically be
31:52
selling shower filters.
31:57
Okay. Yeah, that's another drop shipping
31:59
product that I want to work on. And if our product isn't a quote, what
32:06
should we go for? Like because right now we're going about we're talking about
32:10
Kas. Yeah. So let's do one thing. Let me just
32:12
wrap the lesson up and then I'll speak to you. Yeah. Because we just got to do
32:15
this. Okay. Okay.
32:15
Yeah. Cool. Okay guys, who's ready with their
32:22
subject lines? Okay. Can we be like,
32:31
"Okay, one second. Let me just tell everyone to
32:34
settle down. Okay guys, time is up. So we
32:42
Yeah. Can we get back to our seats, please?
32:51
Just waiting. Guys, can we can we have some silence,
32:55
please? We're going to have someone uh everyone over there. Thank you,
33:01
guys. Okay, cool. So, we're going to pass the
33:07
mic on and then you guys are going to tell me your subject lines. Okay, so
33:10
we'll start with you. Okay, so the first one is oops.
33:15
The second one is your card misses you. The third one is almost now. The fourth
33:21
one is last chance to play the card and the fifth one is still
33:28
okay. So I think yeah it's good but my feedback would be that all the subject
33:33
lines were creating like urgency whereas I could have maybe spoken about um the
33:38
company you know how the customers love us and stuff like that. So, yeah.
33:44
Um, that's the trick. That's the trick. Anyway, who's next? You guys ready? I
33:50
know. You ready? Okay, cool.
33:56
Guys, can we uh Joyce, can we have someone for the mic though?
34:00
Yeah. Yeah, I think right now it's over here.
34:04
Yeah. Why don't you We have so many.
34:08
Let's go. Let's go with five for now. Hey, we miss you. Don't leave your car
34:14
abandoned. We have another one that I just came up with. It's like you left
34:17
your car abandoned. I mean your cards, you know. So like
34:24
then we have like Hey, there's some problems with your
34:31
but but that one's that one's a little too long. You know, it's not going to
34:33
fit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What we were thinking
34:35
is that we have some problems with your order and you haven't placed it.
34:38
Okay, fair enough. And then don't worry, we save everything for you
34:44
and then the other
34:54
and then you like your order or something.
34:57
Okay. Cool. All right. Nice. Nice. Okay. Who's
35:03
next? Subject lines. We've got some Okay, we got one over here. Okay. After
35:08
that, we have
35:16
the best you will ever have as waiting for you. Find it in your car.
35:25
Run. This may be your last chance to have your favorite. Your card is gone,
35:30
but the deal isn't. Okay, cool. Nice. Uh, I think
35:38
Aren't you Aren't you in the same team? The first
36:07
It's going to be pretty much like your what's almost done.
36:18
I understand that. Sorry. Oh, your kas. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, for
36:24
everyone who's using the product in your subject line, I would say don't because
36:28
essentially you want your subject lines to be generic so it suits every product.
36:33
Okay. Okay. So let's say tomorrow if you don't sell a ka you sell something else
36:36
then you can't have a ka in the subject line. So keep it super generic.
36:42
Yeah. Yeah. Generic is good because then it works for all products and not just
36:46
one because your your flow is not just for one product. It's for multiple
36:49
products. Right. So that's the only thing.
36:52
Okay. Cool. Okay. Who is next? Sorry.
37:01
Are you sure you want to the solution for relief. Your discount dies at me.
37:07
Don't miss me. The name of the customer. Did you forget something? The
37:14
other one. Don't let my brain wing. Get yours now. And only a few left. Grab
37:20
yours now before it's too late. Okay. Cool.
37:29
All right. We've got one here and one here. Yeah.
37:40
So we did it not too generic focus on the product
37:46
watches. So the first one is still deciding your time piece is waiting for
37:50
you. Number two, don't let time run out with your cart. Number three, a watch
37:56
like this doesn't stay reserved for long. Four, your perfect watch is almost
38:01
gone. and five last complete your order before
38:05
it disappears. Okay, cool.
38:10
I usually also like using like uh more specific timelines like I'm like okay
38:14
you know your product is gone in like 24 hours or 12 hours like instead of just
38:18
saying it's gone soon I like using a more of a time filter because it creates
38:22
more like aggressive urgency you know I have a question we use discounts in
38:30
our subject um yes you can um but the problem with
38:34
discounts in the subject lines is a lot of the like Gmail for example has their
38:38
don't filter and they don't like promo emails. So the moment you have a
38:41
discount code in a subject line you see you you see how you have spam the spam
38:44
folder and even the promotion folder. I don't want to land up in the promotion
38:48
folder. I want to land up on the inbox because again open rates are more if
38:53
it's inbox versus even promotion. So the moment you have a discount code in the
38:56
subject line the filter on Gmail catches that throws you into spam worst case
39:00
scenario or throws you into the promotion folder which I also think is
39:04
not that great. I want to be in the inbox where he gets all his emails
39:06
basically. Yeah. Yeah. The first one is your girl.
39:13
Okay. The second one is no equals to no dates.
39:16
Math checks out. The third one is last chance save your
39:19
car in brackets and your dating life. Fourth one is even your mom says you
39:25
need these. Oh, okay.
39:27
Fifth one is your ex moved on your thought hasn't.
39:30
Okay, sweet. Okay, cool. I think um yeah, I think
39:36
that's pretty much it. We can sort of I have something to say.
39:40
You want to you want to go? Okay. Last last person.
39:46
We're going to pretend that the person's name is Jeff
39:50
versus Jeff. Jeff, are you forgetting something? Jeff, here's your tracking
39:55
link. Jeff, we're at the door. Jeff, come to the door. It's time to say
40:03
goodbye, Jeff. Goodbye. Okay.
40:10
Cool. All right. So, I think um again what I also Okay, you have one more.
40:14
Okay. Okay. So, can we just pass the mic first? I'm breaking up. If you miss the
40:27
chance how to buy half the car 5 minutes from the G after you check out the next
40:32
only five left and stock don't let the don't let the item pretty badly out of
40:38
stock. Check out now and your card is waiting 10% off just for sale
40:45
last for the items. Okay, cool. Uh, I couldn't tell which
40:50
one was the line, but it sounded a bit long. Like, was this like five or six
40:55
subject lines? How many were there? Five.
40:58
Five. Okay, cool. Cool. All right, that was your team. Cool. Uh,
41:03
if I can have the mic, please. All right. So, I think we've got a fair
41:12
understanding of how to write subject lines. Another one I will throw in and I
41:16
like using is like a subject line which says uh hey your order has been shipped.
41:22
That's the subject line. And he's like what do you mean the order has been
41:24
shipped? I didn't place an order. So he opens the email you know. Uh I think you
41:30
use something like here's your tracking link. Uh and then that also gets the guy
41:33
curious because you didn't place an order but you're saying here's my
41:35
tracking link. So makes him open again. So you have to get super creative with
41:38
your subject lines. And that's how you do it. Now the next thing is guys
41:42
segments. Anyone has an idea what segments are?
41:47
How do you divide exactly? So how do you divide all the
41:52
customers in the list? Because let's say a VIP customer list is someone who's
41:56
bought from me two to three times and I want to give him a different style of
42:02
messaging versus someone who's never bought from me. Okay. So here are some
42:05
of the lists. We have 30-day engaged. We have new subscribers. We have
42:09
non-purchasers. we have potential purchasers and what I can do is I can
42:12
segment these people into different lists and send them a different email
42:17
because I don't want the same email going out to people. So, for example, if
42:21
it's someone who's already bought from me, I don't want to send him a discount
42:24
because he already trusts us. He's bought from us. So, I want to send a
42:27
discount to someone who's a non-purchaser. So, you can actually
42:30
segment your list, right? You have 7-day purchases. So um you have spam traps,
42:36
unengaged users, bouncers, you have all these different lists that you can make
42:41
and segments so that you can put them into different categories. Um here's how
42:46
you can do it. On the left, you can see you go on audience and then you go on
42:50
list and segments. Okay? And then you can have different
42:54
segments for your uh for your email list. Now this is what you guys probably
42:59
get into your inbox every week. It's campaigns. uh looks something like this,
43:04
right? Like you guys can actually select from these pre-made templates. So let's
43:09
say you have Halloween sale, you have a new year sale, you have a new product
43:12
launch, you want to tell people that let's say your store is now live. This
43:16
is exactly what you can send as a campaign. Um you have your subject line,
43:21
you can add your preview text on the right, you can add your sender name, and
43:25
then of course your sender email, right? So pretty simple. Um now sorry
43:32
the name of the uh which
43:35
the one that you were showing it's just uh it's it's templates. So you
43:40
go on camp uh yeah so you go on campaigns you click on campaigns and
43:44
then you click on temp uh this template thing and then you're going to get bunch
43:48
of pre-made templates you can just pick from.
43:50
Okay. I thought it was a different website. No, no, no. It's it's it's like
43:53
okay. So on the top left campaigns and then you open and then you get this and
43:58
then you can literally select like for example for Black Friday you can select
44:01
a Black Friday template which is already made. For Halloween you can select a
44:05
Halloween template who's already made and then of course you can change the
44:08
logo. You can change everything else about um you know the campaign based on
44:12
your product. But this is how you sell uh send campaigns.
44:16
The whole point of a campaign is pretty simple, right? It's it's to tell people
44:20
about something about your product, a sale, whatever. Like it depends. Um so
44:24
yeah, here's campaigns. Here are some campaign ideas, guys. Um you can send
44:29
campaigns for annual holidays, product features, tips and tricks about your
44:34
product, any reviews that you've got about your product, which is obviously
44:38
positive reviews. Um any research to provide. So for example, if you're
44:42
selling a juicer and you are like, "Okay, cool. is you want to talk about
44:46
some health advantages it has. Then you have
44:49
listicles like five reasons you should buy a product. And then you have general
44:55
information which could be anything about the product, business or brand.
44:59
Now list cleaning. Anyone knows who what list cleaning is?
45:05
List cleaning. So let's say you have a list. So what happens? You are going to
45:08
be paying for every subscriber. Okay? This is not free. when you get the email
45:12
thing. So
45:13
per email it charges us 20. I know. So it's like till 10,000 emails
45:17
it charges you a certain amount. So the reason why we need to clean our
45:20
list is because we need to identify inactive subscribers who haven't engaged
45:24
in 90 days. And the reason we want to clean them is
45:27
because we want people to interact with us. And if they're not, why should we be
45:33
paying for them on a monthly basis? So we make them unsubscribe. So that that's
45:37
why we have something called the sunset campaign.
45:41
Okay. So, the whole point of a sunset campaign is to basically email the
45:45
person saying, "Hey, like you haven't engaged with us. You still interested.
45:48
If you're not, then either unsubscribe or like whatever. Engage. Bye." I don't
45:52
know. This is the most basic way to say it.
45:56
Okay guys over there, excuse me. Yeah. There
45:59
is no way to take them out. So, they have to understand.
46:02
I mean, you can you can delete them, but you don't know who to delete. So you
46:06
it's it's only fair to kind of email them and then get them to and it's it's
46:09
a good way to win them back. Like let's say you just want to like get their
46:11
attention back. Um so it's it's always good. So like you want to focus on
46:16
maintaining a smaller and more engaged list rather than a bigger list with like
46:20
more people that you're paying a lot for.
46:24
Um so here's how you create the sunset engagement unengaged subscribers. You
46:29
just go on flows, you click on sunset, and this way you can just um yeah have
46:34
your sunset campaign set up and then it keeps going out to people every 90 days.
46:40
Yeah. So that's it for today, guys. I hope you learned something new, got some
46:44
value, and let's make some money with emails.
46:47
All right, so now we by the way, we have the quiz. So let's get the quiz started.
46:55
It's quiz time. Okay. Yeah.
47:31
All right, guys. No.
47:34
Are you? No, no, no. I'm just you. Okay.
47:36
Yeah. Yeah. Good.
47:44
Hey guys, how's it going? Good, good, good. Okay, so yeah, I just
47:47
wanted to ask you guys what's any any kind of update on the
47:51
Yeah, so we're planning for tomorrow. Oh, we are?
47:54
Yeah. Okay.
47:55
The only thing is uh obviously production is
47:59
huh. We're trying to get the logistics in
48:01
place, but otherwise it's not going to give you a confirmation by end of the
48:05
day. And who's going to give that?
48:08
She has my number, right? Yeah.
48:12
Also, like I gave you my email like by when can you send me the the B- roll and
48:15
send? Okay, cool. So, you have my email,
48:17
right? Okay, cool. So, tomorrow but like any any like uh I mean not something
48:21
crazy early morning or some something, right?
48:23
No, no, I think it'll be after 4. We need the students and we can't get them
48:28
out of class. Aa and Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. And I
48:34
have to decide the hot take. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Any like sort of
48:39
direction you have any ideas or or just I just come up with does it have
48:44
to be about like entrepreneurship or does it could be anything in
48:47
it could be about anything but it should idly be an intersection
48:50
between should be related to you so that you can
48:53
defend myself. Okay, cool.
49:02
Cool. Excited. Full
49:08
schedule by
49:11
trying to figure out all the logistics. It's so hard to get things here. We're
49:15
not able to get a big enough table for example, you know.
49:19
Trying to get all of that. Oh, big enough. But I I think we we'll
49:27
manage like something or the other, right? Like eventually. Yeah. Yeah.
49:30
Cool. All right.
49:37
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you got the approval.
49:39
Yeah. Approval. Okay. Perfect.
49:41
Yesterday. Okay.
49:44
Justice. Heat. Heat.
50:25
Happy birthday, Dad. Happy birthday, Dad.
51:35
Ooh, it's so much different from back here,
51:47
man. This is the
51:54
Yeah, I swear I'm like so much nicer. Hallelujah.
52:47
Hallelujah. I don't think
54:12
That's one. Welcome.


Ads & Scaling
30/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
Mr. Ishan Suri
0:01
Let's settle down. Okay, guys in the back.
0:13
Good, good, good. Okay, awesome, guys. So, um,
0:20
yeah, let's settle down, please. Excuse me, guys. Over there, please.
0:34
All right. So, I think today's lesson is going to be probably the most important
0:38
one out of the lot. We're going to be talking about how to run ads. Um,
0:45
I think 50 to 60% of drop shipping success is basically based on the kind
0:51
of ads you run. Do you know how to run them? So, I think please pay attention
0:55
to today's lesson. Um, there's going to be a lot of things thrown at you in
0:59
terms of numbers, guys. Guys, guys, please. Okay, so there
1:04
going to be a lot of things thrown at you in terms of numbers and how to run
1:07
ads. So, just ask questions in the middle if you don't understand something
1:11
because there's going to be a lot of complex stuff going on today. Uh, but at
1:14
the same time, I hope uh we understand each and every concept. So, just to show
1:19
show you how the whole ad situation works. um you know here's what your uh
1:25
Facebook ad lesson is going to be called. So I I made this up man. It's
1:28
called the Zuck method. This is how I run ads. It's called the Zuck method.
1:32
And this is what it does. Okay. So if you look at this, this is how your
1:36
Facebook ad manager would look. Uh we're going to be going through each and every
1:42
one. I know this looks like a bunch of numbers. It's like a it's like, you
1:45
know, a cockpit inside a plane. It's it's so much data you have to look at.
1:49
So we're going to be going through each and every one of them. Um, but ask
1:53
questions if you don't get it. Um, but here's one of our dashboards. As you can
1:57
see over here, we spent about 330 3 $383,000. We made back about close to
2:04
$600,000. Actually, a lot more because it's not recorded um in terms of u you
2:10
know, realized sales. Here's another one where we spent about close to half a
2:14
million, made back about 2 million um just through ads. So just showing this
2:20
over here because the whole importance of ads is super important. Um organic
2:26
content might fail, everything might fail, but if you crack how to run ads,
2:30
everything is really really scalable. You could scale to millions of dollars
2:35
eventually if you get things right. Okay. So, now today we're going to be
2:40
talking about when to use Facebook ads, how to sign up to Facebook uh and create
2:45
your ad account, a clear step-by-step process of how to set up your ads, how
2:49
to read data in the ad account, the best kind of ads you should use, and most
2:55
importantly, how to not get banned on Facebook because I told you guys that
2:59
getting banned on Facebook basically means that you can't run ads anymore,
3:02
and that is a problem. And then lastly, how do we start running ads profitably?
3:08
Because we don't just want to run ads. We want to be profitable when we run our
3:10
ads. Okay. So, first thing is how do we set up our Facebook business manager?
3:19
You want to be going to business.f FA uh facebook.com and this is the screen you
3:24
want to be you can see uh you want to be logging in with your Facebook ID and
3:28
then the next thing you see is you will have to enter multiple things. Okay. So
3:34
here's the screen you're going to see when you log to facebookus.com
3:38
um what you can do on the top right if you see you can add people. So you can
3:42
go click on people and add and invite people. So basically invite your
3:46
teammates and invite anyone else that you think um is important to kind of
3:53
like have access to this. Why is this very important that if you have just one
3:57
person in your business manager for example in your ad account and your ad
4:01
account gets banned then you're locked out. Does that make sense? If you have
4:05
three people and if one guy gets banned you have two people to kind of open the
4:09
door and let that guy in. Yeah. But if your ad account is banned, everybody
4:13
cannot access your ad account. Sorry.
4:15
But if your ad account is banned, isn't it that everyone even
4:20
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm I'm This is the business manager. So if you have
4:22
multiple ad accounts in the same BM, one gets banned, you can use the other ad
4:26
accounts, but it won't be under your company.
4:29
No, it will. It will. Look at this. So over there I have uh all these ad
4:34
accounts. As you can see, the two which are red, those are the ones which are
4:37
banned. But I can still access the other ones. That's how it works.
4:42
So anyway, you want to be adding multiple people and you want to be
4:46
giving them uh admin control. Okay. So this is how you add people into your ad
4:50
account so that you don't get banned. The next thing is I hope everyone knows.
4:54
Yeah. Should I create the business account
4:58
since the first create the website the the profile page on Facebook?
5:03
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So here's how you create the page, right? You go on page,
5:07
you can create your page from here. And there are other ways of creating pages
5:10
also, but you're going to you have to connect your Facebook page to your
5:13
business manager and start from day one. Yes.
5:16
Yeah, I know that. But it has happened to me that when I do that, they get they
5:22
ban me when I do it the first day. So I wait a couple of days.
5:28
If they're banning you, what you could do is you can warm up. They ban you when
5:32
you attach your page. you're saying um I think what you have to do is identify
5:36
your uh like upload your ID. So they usually want like a identity
5:40
confirmation and if you do that then that solves the problem and you can show
5:44
it to me after class. I can help you out. But okay over here you can
5:48
basically connect your page. You can you can add your Facebook page. You go on
5:51
add over here and you connect your Facebook page.
5:56
And guys here's how you create your ad account. If you see on the top left we
6:00
have ad accounts. Okay. So, you click on add accounts and then you click on add
6:06
and then it's going to ask you information like this like what is your
6:09
ad account name. So, I for example I've named it Teta and then you want to be
6:14
selecting your time zone and currency. You always want to be selecting the time
6:18
zone based on the audience that you're targeting. So, for example, if I'm
6:22
targeting people in the US, I want to be selecting an American LA time zone. If
6:27
I'm targeting people in Dubai, then it's a Dubai time zone and vice versa. Even
6:32
the currency over here, by the way, has to be USD if I'm doing American
6:37
customers. If it's European, I want to be selecting whatever the currency is.
6:40
So, long story short, which whoever your customer is, the time zone and the
6:45
currency needs to be the same, okay? Not from your domestic country and stuff
6:50
like that. Now, some payment method tips. You want to be using credit cards.
6:55
Oops. Oh, okay. You want to be using credit cards over PayPal. Um, and then
7:02
you want to be researching the credit card that gives you the best points um
7:07
in your reg region, right? Like so for example, in my case, I haven't really
7:12
paid for a flight since the last five or 6 years because all the ad spin that
7:15
I've had has been through um, you know, these credit cards. So, just make sure
7:21
that the credit cards you're using. Does every team over here have a credit card?
7:24
At least one person Okay. So, as long as everyone has a
7:29
credit card, then um you want to be using your credit card. The last thing
7:34
is very important. Do not keep entering your credit card details if they are not
7:38
if the credit card is not working. If you keep entering the credit card detail
7:42
and it doesn't work, then the chances of you being banned are a lot because
7:46
Facebook just bans you. If you try and enter the same credit card details and
7:49
it's not accepting it and if you do it multiple times, um then you get banned.
7:54
Now even before we kind of understand how to run ads, we want to understand
7:58
how to avoid Facebook bans because it's super important in the beginning to
8:02
avoid Facebook bands because if you can't run ads, what's the whole point?
8:05
So the first thing is read the guidelines. Okay, I mentioned this
8:08
before. Facebook has guidelines or ad policies that you want to be running.
8:13
This screen over here which you see is basically doomsday scenario. The moment
8:17
you see this, you're done. Okay? You're restrict you're basically restricted
8:21
from advertising. You can't run ads. The moment you see the screen, it's game
8:25
over in terms of at least for that for that moment. So, make sure that you um
8:30
check the advertising policies and standards so you know exactly what you
8:33
can't do. How many of you are running a beauty product over here?
8:38
Okay. 1 2 um Okay. So, for example, if you're
8:43
running a beauty product, you can't show too much skin in your ad. That's a
8:48
policy. If you show too much skin, then you get banned. Now, it could even be
8:52
your hand. It doesn't matter. It doesn't mean like provocative skin. It just
8:56
means skin. So, that's a policy. So, you you need to know exactly what your
9:01
product is allowed to show or not to show. Correct?
9:06
Now, here are some best practices to avoid bans, avoid using a VPN, don't log
9:11
into multiple accounts, and refrain from creating multiple person profiles. So,
9:17
for example, on your um desktop or on your laptop, don't have
9:22
like five Facebook profiles logged in because that's suspicious. Any
9:26
suspicious activity from Facebook? Yeah. What if it's like different?
9:32
Yeah. Okay, fine. This different browsers you can uh that's still fine, I
9:36
would say. But definitely not the same browser.
9:39
Yeah, not the same browser and not multiple profiles.
9:43
Okay, guys. Make sense? Cool. Okay. So, don't create multiple profiles because
9:49
any suspicious activity will get you banned. Um, the next thing is limit
9:54
logging into Facebook from various locations. There was a time that I was
9:58
in a certain place, then I was in Bali like 6 hours later and I got banned
10:01
because the IP got flagged and basically suspicious. Facebook doesn't even
10:06
understand if you take a flight and go somewhere else. It's as stupid as that,
10:09
but that's the truth. So, limit logging into Facebook from various locations.
10:13
Avoid multiple Facebook pages. So only have one and be cautious with payment
10:19
methods. You don't want to be changing your payment methods too frequently
10:22
because then again very suspicious like Facebook feels like you're basically
10:25
you've stole someone's card and you're using it. So only use maybe one or two
10:29
payment methods in the beginning. Okay. Now let's talk about Facebook
10:35
pixels. Who knows what a Facebook pixel is?
10:40
Okay. What what what is a Facebook pixel?
10:45
It's basically that Facebook
10:54
that it has. Yeah. Cool.
11:00
Yeah. I mean, right answer. I think you guys know it anyway. Um, so yeah, for
11:03
the ones who don't, a Facebook pixel is a small piece of tracking code you
11:07
install on your website to measure, optimize, and build audiences. Think of
11:11
it as a code which tells you what's happening on your website. So for
11:15
example, if someone viewed your page, if someone added to cart, if someone
11:18
initiated checkout, if someone bought your product, this code will tell you
11:22
exactly what's happening. And based on these sets of information is when we are
11:28
going to make our decisions. Right now, let's talk about how do we actually set
11:33
up our pixel. So if you see on the left, bottom left over there, we go on data
11:37
sources. Okay. And then we click on data sets and
11:43
pixels over there. And then after that, this is what the pixel page looks like.
11:48
Um, you go on the top right and you click on add. So that's you adding a
11:52
pixel. And then it's going to ask you which ad account do you want to connect
11:57
your pixel to. So as you guys just saw, we created an ad account and we
12:01
connected the pixel, right? So we connect our ad account to the pixel from
12:06
there. And then boom, you're done. your pixel is created and you've connected it
12:10
to the ad account which is going to be running your ads. So pretty basic stuff
12:13
over there here too. Now why is it important? It's important because it's
12:18
essential for optimization. You cannot improve what you don't measure, right?
12:23
So it tracks campaign effectiveness, crucial for optimization and it also
12:28
helps you improve your results with your ads. So super important and that's why
12:32
you need it. Um now what you have to understand is we have to integrate.
12:39
Okay guys over there excuse me. Yeah. So the way you have to understand
12:46
this is you have to integrate your Shopify with your Facebook pixel. You
12:50
got to connect Facebook and you're going to you have to connect Shopify because
12:53
otherwise how are they going to know what's happening on the website? So
12:56
here's one way to do it. Okay, I'm sure you guys have seen this screen by now.
13:00
So over there on the on the left you see Facebook and Instagram. That is a app
13:04
you can download from the Shopify app store. Go on Shopify app store. Click
13:09
Facebook and Instagram and download the app. And then all you have to do is
13:14
follow these settings and then your Facebook pixel is connected. That is
13:18
step one. The next step is you go on vitals and
13:22
you take your pixel ID. So you see this code over here. Every pixel has an ID.
13:26
So you you take this, you copy it and then you paste it over there on your
13:30
vitals app and then your pixel is done. How many of you have downloaded vitals
13:35
are using vitals? Vital the apples.
13:41
Okay, cool. So I mean for the ones who aren't, you could follow step one. For
13:45
the ones who are this is a lot easier. Just copy paste. It's like five minute
13:49
job. Copy paste your pixel ID and paste it on vitals.
13:55
Now if you guys can see we have these
13:59
columns right so we have campaign we have amount spent purchases what's the
14:04
value of the purchases what's the budget these are all called columns
14:10
and you have to set up these columns on your Facebook ads manager it's not going
14:13
to come looking like this okay you have to set it up so the way you do that is
14:17
you go on the top you see columns over there right you click on columns and the
14:21
next thing you see is this and then you want to go all the way down
14:26
and click on customize columns. And now what you can do is you can basically
14:31
drag and drop things and customize your own columns. So here's how your column
14:35
should look like. Okay, essential guys. This is so important. If you don't know
14:40
this, you don't know what's happening with your ads. All of these metrics are
14:44
something that you have to kind of put into your um column section so that it
14:49
looks like the screen that I just showed you. So I think let's go one by one and
14:52
understand which one's what. So okay let's go from the top. I want answers
14:56
from you. Okay. What campaign what is that?
15:01
Campaign. The campaign you're running right pretty basic. Next thing delivery.
15:05
Delivery is basically like is the campaign on or off. Amount spent. Again
15:10
very basic. The amount I'm spending on this. Budget. What is the budget? Date
15:14
created. What date did I create this campaign? Date last edited. When did I
15:19
edit it last? Okay, anyone for CPM? What's CPM?
15:23
Cost per thousand impression. What does that mean?
15:25
That's how much you pay for,000 people to see your ad.
15:28
Okay, so what is the difference between cost per thousand impressions? So what
15:32
is the difference between an impression and a click?
15:35
How many people click your ads versus how many people were showing
15:40
Exactly. So cost per,000 impressions is thou the cost of showing a rat a,000
15:45
people versus let me give an example. Okay, if you go to a shopping mall and
15:49
if you see uh let's say the shop from outside and you just pass the shop and
15:54
don't go inside, that is an impression. You do not go inside, you just passed
15:57
it. But if you go inside the shop, that means that's a click. So the difference
16:02
between an impression and a click is for someone to see the ad versus someone
16:06
clicking on the ad. Okay, cost per unique link click also very
16:11
simple. How much does it cost for each customer to click on it? But I'll ask
16:14
you a question. What is the difference between cost per unique link click and a
16:18
cost per click? Uh cost per click can be like one person
16:23
click five 10 times. Cost per unit is basically one person
16:29
that one person consider no matter how many times you click is considered as
16:33
one. Correct. Absolutely correct. Click
16:36
through rate. This is the percentage of people who click on your ad. So let's
16:40
say if it's 2% that means 2% of people clicked on your ad. Therefore, your CTR
16:44
is 2%. Again, the rest are pretty simple. Add
16:47
to card, uh checkouts initiated, purchases, cost per purchase, uh what is
16:53
the value of your purchases, return on ad spend. Okay, who doesn't know what
16:58
return on ad spend is? Anyone? Or like, let's just put it this way. If I spent
17:04
$5 on ads and I made back 35, what's my ras or return on ad spend?
17:13
If I spend five bucks on ads and I made bad $35, what's my return on ad spend?
17:17
Seven. Cool. So, purchase robas. Then you have
17:21
engagement rate ranking, conversion rate ranking. Anyone knows these two? What's
17:26
engagement rate ranking and conversion rate ranking?
17:30
What? Those two on top. Engagement rate
17:32
ranking and conversion rate ranking. Conversion is about the purchase you
17:36
have received. Okay. like engagement like view, likes,
17:41
comments. Engagement ranking is basically the
17:45
interactions on your post. It can be like comments, likes or how long they
17:51
spend on the ad and conversion. It depends on your campaign. If it's a
17:56
purchase or lead campaign, it can depends depending on your result.
18:02
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So conversions is
18:04
essentially the amount of conversions it's getting from that campaign which is
18:07
the sales. Engagement is against likes, share, comments. It basically judges
18:10
that. Um then you have video average play time which is also a very important
18:14
metric. Um and then you have video plays 25% 50 75 95. Let's understand how these
18:22
metrics are important. If how will these metrics help me in my ad if I know how
18:27
many people played my video 25 times, 50 times, 75 times. What do you guys think?
18:34
like video plays 25, 50, 75. How will this help me understand how well my ad
18:38
is doing? If my video is having a good engagement,
18:41
a good book, good script, that's that is what basically the percentage of that is
18:50
telling you. Yeah. But like for example, what I'm
18:52
trying to say is like let's say my video plays at 25% or higher, but my video
18:57
plays at 50% or lower. That means that my hook is good, but everything after my
19:00
hook is bad. Or let's say if my hook is good and after my hook stuff is good. So
19:04
these two are high but this is low. So everything which happens after 50% of
19:08
the video is bad. So this helps me kind of understand how my ad is doing.
19:12
Correct? So you have to set up these columns. Um they're super important. And
19:17
again the next thing is video average play time. Guys, you can actually see
19:20
this data and you can see at which seconds. So let's say if my ad was 1
19:24
minute and 28 seconds long, I can literally see where my audience lost
19:28
their attention like second by second. So clearly it's been losing attention
19:33
since let's say the 15 second and all the way down the graph is on the low. We
19:38
want something which goes the other way around. Right? So this is something also
19:41
you can view inside um your ads. Now again utilizing your custom
19:49
dashboard you want to sort and filter um you know your dashboard so you have the
19:54
best return on ad spend and the amount spend. make informed decisions and you
19:58
monitor your video engagement like you track average play time like I just
20:02
showed you guys. So again important metrics. Now here's the cool part like
20:06
let's set up our first Facebook campaign. So what you first have to do
20:10
is understand the ads manager. What are ads? What are adsets? Um and what are
20:15
campaigns? So there are three levels okay and this is how it looks. So here's
20:19
how it looks guys. So first thing is the campaign on top. So the campaign is
20:23
essentially for your product. Then you have the ads set. An ads set holds a
20:27
group of ads and then you have the ad. So this is how your campaign would
20:31
basically look. You would have a campaign. You would have a ad set. So an
20:35
adset is basically just used to target your customer. So let's say if I want to
20:40
target someone in the beauty niche, my interest would be beauty and therefore
20:43
that interest is equal to adset. That's it. So think of the adset as something
20:47
which is used to target your actual customer. And then again you have your
20:51
ads which is what we decided uh discussed last week on how to create
20:55
engaging ads. Now how do we set up our adsets? We
21:00
could go broad targeting which is basically telling Facebook to find our
21:03
customer for us. The next thing is we want to be using performance goals to
21:07
maximize and test multiple uh optimized audiences. And then we can also exclude
21:14
audiences. Let's say I don't want to target some people. I can also exclude
21:18
them in my Facebook ads um to get the best performance possible. Now here's
21:23
how we scale our creatives. Okay, horizontal scale is let's say if I have
21:28
a certain creative working and it's working in the audience beauty. Now I
21:33
want to use that same creative in a new audience which is essentially I want to
21:37
use it for cosmetics. And over here vertical scale means that let's say a
21:42
certain creative is working. Now I just want another creative to replace that
21:46
creative so it starts working. So this these are the two ways of um doing
21:50
creatives. Now okay guys let's pay attention to this.
21:55
This is super important. This is your testing framework. Okay. How do we test
21:58
our product? So the first thing is we start with $50 per campaign. We have 10
22:04
adsets at $5 each. We filter the adsets which are not getting sales and then we
22:10
run this for three to four days. I had a lot of people asking me this question.
22:14
How long should we run our campaign? So, we're running our campaigns for 3 to 4
22:17
days. We're going to be spending about 200 bucks. If it doesn't get a sale, we
22:21
move on. We kill it. We move on. Okay. And this is how it's going to look.
22:26
Cool. So, again, I'll take it from the top. We have a sales campaign. We have
22:30
10 adsets, okay, at $5 each. and each adset which will have a single interest.
22:36
So let's take the beauty example again. Let's say this is an adset and I have
22:41
three interests in this. Beauty, cosmetics, makeup. Okay. But then
22:46
there's another situation where I have beauty, cosmetics and makeup in three
22:50
different adsets. Which one should I pick and why?
22:56
Like should I go multiple stacked interests in one adset or should I go
23:00
single interest in multiple adsets? depends on.
23:07
No, there's one answer to this. So you you said the right answer, but
23:11
I'm asking you why. So single interest, but why
23:16
we don't know which one is going to go best?
23:19
Um because because it will keep showing
23:22
that audience that specific app and you can tailor your app your different ads
23:30
um to that ad set or audience. Yeah. Yeah. So the simple answer to this
23:33
is see if I have makeup, cosmetics and beauty in one adset and let's say this
23:37
ads set gets a sale. How do I know which one got the sale? Was it makeup? Was it
23:41
cosmetics? Yeah. But you also can do that. You can
23:43
have one adset and then ads and you you your can also track the individual ads.
23:50
No I I I get that
23:53
like um you mentioned no no you can track the ad but you can't
23:57
track the audience. The only way you can track the audience is let's say it's
24:01
makeup, cosmetics, and beauty. If this gets the sale, then I know cosmetic got
24:05
the sale. So, I kill these two and I scale this. And that is why you need
24:09
single interest targeting, right? Because you know exactly which one gets
24:11
the sale. So, what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to set up a sales
24:15
campaign. I'm going to have 10 adsets. So, each box will be a single interest.
24:20
And on day one, I will spend 50 bucks. Day 250, day 350, day 450. And in total,
24:26
I'm going to be spending Yeah. Why would you spend less per adset than
24:31
the budget of the product and the cost of the product? So assuming that it has
24:37
to be better than it may be. So that's what I said you're going to be
24:41
spending um so for example each adset is spending let's say five bucks right so
24:46
in a span of 4 days it's going to be spending about 25
24:50
right and you need to understand is what is your cost per purchase. So if you're
24:55
selling a product about 60 to 50 bucks, your cost of purchase has to be lower
24:59
than 25. So eventually you will be ending up spending the whole thing.
25:04
You're not going to be spending the $5 throughout the rest of the time. You
25:07
will scale the ones which do well. And I'm going to get to that. So how do we
25:11
scale the adsets which do well? So this is not forever. It's just for the start
25:15
because let's put it this way. If you spend too much and it doesn't work, then
25:19
you spend too much on a product which wasn't going to work. You understand?
25:22
So, we're trying to space the budget out because essentially we're not just
25:24
testing one product. We're testing 2 3 4 5 6 7 10. It could be any depending on
25:29
how long it's going to take you. Okay? So, we we'll get to the scaling part.
25:36
Now, if you guys remember this is the video structure that we used uh on
25:40
Monday. You guys remember this? So, what we have to do is make three to
25:45
four creatives per product test. So we're going to be using this which I
25:50
showed you last time and have three to four creatives. And coming back to this
25:55
each ad set will have those four creatives as you can see over there in
25:59
the adset. So again campaign ads set and then four creatives per adset. The
26:05
creatives are going to be the same. They don't change because we're going to be
26:08
showing the creative to different audiences. Okay? So every creative or
26:13
the four over there will go onto a different adset. So, adset one, four
26:17
creatives. Adset two, four creatives. The same thing. It could be video,
26:20
image, depending on what you're going to start, but this is how it's going to
26:23
look. Yeah. Now, you're spending nothing per ad.
26:27
That's like how how you supposed to get a winning app when you're not spending
26:30
that much per ad. Even though the algorithm is going to quickly find out
26:34
which one is best enough if you split it that
26:40
it will spend per ad. Who says it won't? Huh? So the algo is going to decide
26:43
which ads the best out of the four and it's going to allot the budget to that.
26:47
Yeah. But there's not much budget. So it doesn't have much data to work with.
26:52
Um depending on which Okay. What's your AOV? What's your product price?
26:56
Uh it's 50. Yeah. Easily he's going to spend that
26:58
money, man. Come on. I' I've used the same budget for selling products for
27:01
$150. It will spend the budget across the days. Okay. Okay. Let me let me let
27:06
me come to this sheet and you understand now.
27:09
So this is what I gave you guys. Correct.
27:13
If you're spell if you're selling a like you said you're selling a a product for
27:16
$47 which is around your price then your break even CAC for example
27:23
your customer acquisition cost to have a net profit of 21% is 20 bucks. So that
27:28
means that to be 20% net profitable you can only spend $20. Correct. And if you
27:34
spend $5 a day in 4 days you spend how much?
27:37
25 20
27:39
20. Exactly. Exactly. Now you're splitting
27:42
it across four ads. You're not splitting it. The algo
27:44
decides where it goes. So when you test the four ads, you will not see an equal
27:48
split between ads. You will see Yeah. But like if you put four bits,
27:58
for example, they can only show one. They can
28:03
Yeah. They what they're going to do is they're going to all lot the budget more
28:07
than 90% on one ad mainly. So, your best ad is going to get most of your budget
28:12
essentially. So, it's not going to be, okay, let's say you're spending 20
28:15
bucks. It's not like every ad's going to be spending five55 if you have four ads.
28:18
It's going to be like $18 for one ad and the rest three will spend two. You know
28:23
what I mean? That's that's the split how it works usually. You'll see.
28:29
So, okay. So, I kind of went through this
28:32
which is three to four creatives. Um, now here's how we can actually target
28:39
our adsets. So, one, we have open targeting, which is basically telling
28:43
Facebook what to do and they can just go find our product for us. Or we have
28:48
interest targeting, where we tell Facebook, use interest group to direct
28:52
ads towards uh potential buyers. So guys, now what I've done is I've
28:56
basically created like a like a quick demo for you guys. So just pay attention
29:00
to this. It's a screen recording. Uh we're going to set up a campaign live
29:04
over here so you guys uh get an idea of how it looks. So let me just make it
29:08
full screen. Okay. So this is essentially what your ad account is
29:12
going to look in the beginning. Okay. It's going to be like this essentially.
29:16
Of course I haven't set up all the columns right now as you can see, but
29:19
you would have to do that. So the first thing we're going to do
29:26
is click on create. So once we click on create
29:31
and if you can see over here okay uh we have campaigns over here we have adsets
29:36
and then we have ads just the way I showed you guys these are three things
29:39
so first what we're going to do is we're going to select create now it's asking
29:42
us okay which campaign objective should I choose awareness traffic engagement we
29:48
don't give a [ __ ] about that we care only about one thing sales okay because
29:51
that's what we want to do so we click on sales
29:58
and then we press continue. Is there any circumstance that you try
30:04
other campaigns? The only time I try engagement or let's
30:08
say uh page likes or anything is when I want to warm up my ad account, which is
30:13
a way of saying that sometimes Facebook bans you if you just start off with
30:18
sales campaigns from day zero. So warming up my ad account is just getting
30:22
some traffic on the website. I warm it up and then I run sales campaigns. So
30:26
that's the only time I do that. Otherwise, I I I don't. But anyway,
30:30
right now what we're doing is we're setting up our sales campaign. Okay. So,
30:34
I'm going to name my sales campaign like product one, but you would name it uh
30:38
whatever your product is. So, let's say if you're selling whatever beauty
30:41
product. So, now we're going to go down. We're going to select our budget. So,
30:46
usually when we test, we never go campaign budget. We al always go adset
30:50
budget or [ __ ] Now I'm going uh way down and I think
30:57
the campaign setup now is basically done. Okay, that's it. The campaign's
31:01
done. Now let's move on to our adset. Okay, so conversion location. I don't
31:07
want it to go to an app or a website. I want to go straight to my website. So
31:10
I'm going to select website. And here is the pixel setup. If you guys
31:15
remember, we created a pixel called Teta. And that's what we're selecting
31:19
over here. So we need to select the exact pixel. So we're going to select
31:23
the pixel over here which is terra for example. You guys will have your own.
31:28
And the next thing we want to select is our conversion campaign. So do we want
31:32
it to check out? Do we want it to like start a free trial? No, we want a
31:36
purchase conversion event. So we always go purchase. Um the next thing we want
31:41
to do is we want to select the budget. Okay. So what was the budget per adset,
31:46
guys? How much are we going to be selecting per adset?
31:49
$5. $5. Exactly. Again, this is I think a Philippine account or something, so I
31:53
can't select $5. Um, but again, this is like you you got to put $5 over here
31:58
because yours will be USD. So, select $5 over here. Then, let's go to start date.
32:04
I always, let's say I'm sitting on the 29th of September. I always launch the
32:09
next day 4:00 a.m. The reason for that is usually people launch at 12:00 a.m.
32:14
But the reason I launch at 4:00 a.m. is because the traffic from 12:00 a.m. to
32:17
4:00 a.m. is usually really bad. And the real traffic, the good traffic starts
32:21
from 4:00 a.m. in the morning. So I want to show my ads when the traffic is in
32:25
the best possible buyer intent behavior, right? So, I would select the next day
32:31
and I would go 4:00 a.m. This is basically me scheduling the
32:38
adset like when should it launch? Now, here's the part where we select our
32:42
interest. Okay, first let's select our location. Uh, I want to go United States
32:46
because again that's my target market. So, I'm going to select United States
32:49
and I'm going to remove Philippines obviously because that's not what we're
32:52
targeting. The next thing you want to do is uh you know the age. So 18 to 65 is
32:57
the target audience age which is fine. And now I want to select the interest
33:03
like what interest should I target my customer with. So I'm going to click on
33:08
this uh then click on switch setup and then I go on detail targeting. This
33:17
is where I actually can select the interest that I want to use. Um so for
33:21
example right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select let's say if it's
33:24
a beauty product there is an interest called beauty. So I'm going to literally
33:27
select beauty right and there multiple other interests
33:31
as you can see beauty salons lot of things but I'm going to select
33:36
beauty right now because that that's what makes sense for my product
33:42
and the cool thing over here is you can actually see the audience size.
33:47
So if you see here everyone who is interested in beauty in the United
33:52
States the estimated audience size for that is about 112 million to 132 million
33:59
which is again something which is important like I need to know what my
34:02
audience size is right. So now now that the audience size is
34:09
defined uh the next thing I want to do is
34:16
yeah that part is done. So here are just some of the other
34:22
interests I can use like facial personal care spas. These are other interests I
34:27
can use to target my customers. Um but right now I'm just showing it to you.
34:31
Let's move on. Let's move on to like setting up our ad now. So we've set up
34:34
our campaign. Uh here I'm basically naming my adset. So I want to name this
34:38
as beauty because I'm targeting people who are only interested in beauty,
34:41
right? So beauty people who are aged 18 to 65,
34:47
right? And then I'm going to be targeting all genders, male and female.
34:51
So I'm going to name it as that. And now the next thing is u this is the
34:57
part where we set up our ads. So I'm going to call it ad one. And then I'm
35:01
going to select my Facebook page. So again you will select your Facebook page
35:03
and your Instagram account. Here it's asking me how do I create an ad. Um so
35:07
I'm going to make it flexible the format. I don't want only image or
35:11
video. I want to make it flexible. So that's making it flexible. Now here it's
35:15
asking me to add a video or an image. So this is the ad you've already created.
35:19
You would upload it over here. And this way you can add it um onto the Facebook
35:23
ads manager. The next thing is primary text. You know the text which comes on
35:27
top of your ad is what you would do here. So your primary text, you could
35:31
use chat GPD, you could use cloud AI to kind of figure out what to kind of write
35:35
here. This this stuff is pretty simple. Um
35:41
I could write something like are you ready for your flawless skin? This is
35:44
basic. So now the next thing I've done guys is
35:48
like like I've uploaded this product, right? Like it's okay. Hold on.
36:01
So I've uploaded this picture of this product again and I've written the
36:04
primary text. Um this is again just one product. You could upload your product
36:08
here and you could see the preview of your ad. Like how is your ad going to be
36:11
looking? You got to be changing your description and your headline. And then
36:16
over here you add your website URL. Where do you want to send your traffic?
36:19
So let's say you want to send your traffic to your product page. And then
36:23
you select shop now. That's your pixel ID.
36:31
And here's how you can see your ad will look on reals on your explore page feed.
36:36
So basically all the ways you can look at your ad which is a preview section
36:44
and that's basically it. This is your ad which is set up. But if you remember we
36:48
only have I'm going to be testing it with three ads if you remember. We don't
36:52
want one ad. We want three ads to test our products. So essentially, I've
36:55
duplicated the ad and I've made it add two and add three because we want we
36:59
want to be running three ads. Okay guys, guys at the back, let's pay
37:04
attention please. Thank you. So yeah, add one, add two, and add three. So now
37:08
I have one adset and I have three ads. All I have to do for ad two and add
37:14
three is just change the creative. Okay? Because I'm not going to be running the
37:18
same creative. So I'm just going to change the creative. In this case, I've
37:20
used the same creative, but in add 2, you would change the creative. you you
37:24
would use a different ad and for ad three also you would just go remove that
37:28
ad and choose a different creative pretty simple. So you would have
37:31
different ads for ad one, ad two and ad three.
37:36
So now what we've done is we've set up our campaign. We have one ad set live
37:40
and we also have three ads. Excuse me guys.
37:45
Attention please. So we've set up our adsets. We've set up our ads. Um, and
37:50
now what we're going to do, if you guys remember, how many adsets did we need to
37:54
launch a campaign? 10.
37:57
Okay, so we need 10 adsets, but we only have one. So, what I'm going to do is
38:01
I'm going to duplicate this adset nine more times, and therefore I will have
38:05
10. So, I'm just going to do this over here in the existing campaign. I'm going
38:09
to duplicate this nine more times. The same adset.
38:14
Yes, the same adset for now. We'll make the changes now. Right now. So right now
38:18
what we've done is we've duplicated the same adset but all the adsets are
38:21
targeting beauty. Correct? So we don't we have to not change that. We have to
38:25
use newer interests. So that's what I'm doing over here. I'm basically adding
38:29
new interest for each adset. So like for example now I'm going to the new adset
38:34
and let me let me select a different interest group that I want to target.
38:37
Right? So let's first remove beauty and let's say I want to target people who
38:41
are interested in cosmetics. So here you go cosmetics. I remove beauty and then
38:46
now I'm targeting people who are interested in cosmetics. So I name it
38:49
cosmetics. Okay. Then I go to the next one and like I'm like cool now let's
38:53
target someone else. So I'm going to be using a different target audience. So
38:57
over here we have so many of them but I'm going to target people who are
39:00
interested in spas. Okay. So I'm going to go here again and name
39:05
it spars. So this way what I've done is guys if
39:09
you can see this is how it's going to look. You're
39:12
going to have one campaign. You're going to have 10 adsets. And then you're going
39:16
to have these 10 adsets. And each adset will have a different interest. Now
39:20
again, I have not used I've only done it twice, but you would have to do it 10
39:25
times for different adsets. So what I'm going to do is I'm just
39:29
going to name this um like interest one, interest 2, interest 3, which is
39:34
basically the interest that you guys are going to be using.
39:39
Each interest again guys is a different audience that you're targeting based on
39:43
their interest, right? Pretty simple. And then I'm going to save this. And
39:47
eventually this is how your campaign is going to be looking.
39:52
So you're going to have these 10 interests. Okay? So interest one could
39:57
be anything. Um all of these adsets will have a different interest. Your budget
40:01
would be $5. Again, it looks 500 over here, but it's $5. And then you will
40:07
have one campaign like I said you will have 10 interests
40:12
and then you will have three ads for each interest which makes it a total of
40:17
um if you see in the next in the next bit you will have 30 ads because 10 into
40:23
three is 30 ads. So you're going to have 30 ads and then you're going to go and
40:27
review and publish and just basically publish the campaign and bas that's it
40:32
guys. That's how you launch the first campaign. But like now we're going to
40:35
get into like okay even after we launch the first campaign, what do we really do
40:39
after that? Right. Okay.
40:46
So now that we launched our first campaign, what do we do after that?
40:51
So here's the media buying SOP. Super important. What do you do on day one?
40:55
You cut any adsets above the ideal cost per click CTR or CTM. On day two, you do
41:02
the same thing, but you're looking for add to cart or initiate checkouts, which
41:05
basically means that you're looking for people who are interested. So, anyone
41:08
who adds to card or initiates checkout are people who are interested. And in
41:12
day three, you're looking for sales. And whichever interest get us gets us the
41:16
sales, we start duplicating that. So, I want you guys to like really make note
41:22
of this. This is the ideal metric. How do you know what is a good CPC, what is
41:26
a good CPM, what is a good CTR? So in the big four markets which is I think
41:31
most of you lot are in this group right so the ideal cost per click should be
41:35
below a dollar a half ideal CPM is below $35 and the ideal CTR is greater than
41:42
one ideally above 2%. And your ideal cost per purchase is again calculated
41:48
based on the profit sheet that I just showed you and also your ideal return on
41:53
ad spend. So you need to know these metrics to really know if something is
41:56
doing well or not otherwise you're in the blind right. So just make a note of
42:00
these. I've also made this guy made this for
42:03
you guys. So again uh you can have this as a SOP for your media buying. So you
42:08
have a single uh campaign for each product. You have 10 adsets and then you
42:13
only let the adsets run which are doing well.
42:20
Now let's get into low budget testing. Okay. I I think I went over this before,
42:24
but you have the return on ad spend, which I
42:28
know you you guys know what return on ad spend is. What is a break even return on
42:31
ad spend? Anyone, which is probably the most important
42:35
metric when it comes to uh understanding if your ad when to kill your ad or when
42:39
to Yeah. What's the break even return on ad spend?
42:48
Sorry. No, no. I'm saying what is a break even
42:52
return on an ad spend? What does it mean?
42:54
It means that you like the amount of money it cost you to acquire times the
42:58
amount of money cost like cost you. So basically you lose money.
43:06
Exactly. So break even rewards is essentially the number in which you
43:09
don't lose money or you don't gain any money. Um so for example for this
43:14
product at 2.35 return on ad spend I am 21% net profitable but at 1.6 67 I'm
43:21
break even. This is so important because this tells me that I'm breaking even.
43:25
Anything below this I start losing money. Anything above this I start
43:28
making money. So before you test any product you need to know what your break
43:33
even draws is so that when you see it on your ads manager you know exactly what
43:36
to do. So any adset which is falling below this number or your break even ras
43:41
you kill it. Any adset which is essentially above it is something that
43:46
you scale. It's basically as simple as that.
43:50
Now, here are the key components for ad success. You want to have a great offer.
43:54
Your ad creative should be bang on, which is essentially what you guys are
43:57
making. We covered this last week. And your landing page should be clear and
44:01
compelling. This is part of the Shopify pages you've built. So, we've already
44:04
been through that. I'm not going to repeat that. Um, you want to be
44:06
launching with four ads. You want a single campaign structure. And you want
44:11
to be iterating and optimizing your campaigns every uh every 4 to 7 days.
44:15
Okay? So analyzing your ROS and then kind of seeing what's working and what's
44:20
not working. So guys in a nutshell what you have to understand is whatever is
44:23
working I scale it. Whatever is not working I basically kill it and move on.
44:28
And the metrics that I've given you will tell you to how to decide if something's
44:33
working or not. Right? So here's how it it would look. So on
44:38
day one you launch your campaign for example. you have one interest uh you
44:42
know over there and then you have multiple ads and on day four and seven
44:46
you will kill the worst performing adset. So let's say if this one doesn't
44:50
do well I kill it which means I switch it off and then I scale the ones which
44:54
work and we're going to get to the scaling part now.
44:58
So um yeah this part is analyzing your data. So you review overall performance.
45:03
There's a tool called triple whale that you guys can use to um you know manage
45:07
your performance but it's a bit expensive. I would recommend just have a
45:10
Google sheet. So for every day you have sales minus ad spend minus product cost
45:15
equal to profit or loss. So you maintain that every day to know where you stand.
45:20
Um and okay, we've been through the return
45:25
on ad spend part. So I'm going to skip this. Um
45:29
now let's get to the scaling method. Again I've created a short demo and this
45:33
is how you scale your campaigns guys. So there's vertical scaling and horizontal
45:37
scaling. Okay. So vertical scaling is when you increase the budget of your
45:41
adset by 20%. And horizontal scaling is when you duplicate the winning adset
45:46
three times. I'm going to show you how this works. So let's come to the demo
45:51
part again. So please pay attention here. I'm just going to play the
45:54
recording now. So the last screen that you guys saw was
45:58
we launched a campaign and we had like 10 interests in it. Okay. Now let's for
46:03
example guys over there, excuse me. Can we have Yeah,
46:09
let's just pay attention to this guys. This is how you scale your adsets. So,
46:12
if you don't know how to scale your campaigns, you're not going to make any
46:15
money. So, let's just pay attention here. Okay. So, let's say we had 10
46:18
adsets that we launched with and let's say cosmetics does well and then spars
46:22
gets a sale and then interest 2 gets a sale and then beauty also gets a sale
46:26
and all the other six don't get a sale. So, they don't work. Now, what do I do?
46:31
So what I do right now is firstly I increase the budget by 20%. So
46:38
I'm going to increase the budget of 500 by 20%. In your case it's $5 but
46:41
whatever. So 20% of that is about 100 bucks more. So I'm going to increase it
46:45
to 600. So I scale it 20%. That's one. And the next thing I do is I
46:51
duplicate the adset which worked three times. Okay? And I double the budget. So
46:57
I've duplicated it three times. I'm just going to name it differently so
47:02
I know exactly which adset it is. So I usually name it like 29 A 29 BC
47:10
which is basically the date that I launched it on. So I know the exact date
47:13
of the adset. So let's say it's 29 ABC. And now I will increase the budget. So
47:18
the budget was 500. I'm doubling the budget now. And I'm going to make it
47:22
a,000. And that's how I'm scaling by duplicating the adset. Okay. So I'm
47:28
going to make this a,000 because it was 500 before. Again, this is the not the
47:32
scale. So yeah, it's 1,000 now. And this is all good. The start date and
47:36
everything. And now I'm just going to hit publish.
47:43
So now it's just publishing my adsets essentially. And as you can see over
47:47
here, uh what we have is we have these three duplicates with double the budget
47:54
of the original adset. And the original adset essentially has um we've scaled it
48:00
20%. So this is how you scale your adsets by either increasing the budget
48:05
and also duplicating the adset multiple times. And you keep doing this till it
48:10
keeps working till it keeps matching your ideal metrics. And just this method
48:14
alone will easily help you scale to 100K a month in sales. Okay. Now in terms of
48:20
creative ad testing, uh I think we've been through this. You can use images,
48:24
you can use videos. Um, you can use unboxing videos, memes,
48:32
influencer photo. I'm not going to go through the creatives too much because
48:34
we covered this last week. Uh, what are principles of a good ad? It's explaining
48:39
unique selling propositions. Educate or entertain the customer. Have a great
48:43
offer and urgency. Uh, make sure they're not pixelated and are HD and they are
48:47
not boring. Um, you can also go on tools like Trend Rocket and go on the ads
48:52
section and find what exact ads work for you.
48:56
Um, and then again multiple times of launching your ads. So, what are the ad
49:00
types? What are the choosing formats? What are the how do you craft your ads?
49:03
Again, I covered this in detail last week, but I just put it out there over
49:07
here today too. Um, and whenever I do find a good ad, guys, this is what I
49:11
like doing. I like creating a sheet and I like to understand, okay, what was the
49:15
bold statement on the ad? What was the benefit and I hype? what was the pain
49:18
point? What was the objection? And I like writing this down so that when I
49:23
start creating my ad, I can use these same principles for creating my ad. And
49:29
that's it guys. That's uh basically it. You launch your ads, right? Um you you
49:34
take inspiration, you launch, you research, and you have a mix of three to
49:38
five ads, images or videos to launch your ads. And yeah, I think that's it.
49:43
We are at the end of the lesson. I hope you guys liked it. Uh, thank you so
49:46
much. And yeah, let's keep it running. So, now we have the quiz. Let's go.
