Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:04
Everyone's marked their attendance, right?
0:07
Has everyone marked their attendance? No.
0:49
Can we begin? Could
1:14
you finish the sentence? Hallelujah.
1:47
Can you begin? Can I get a slight ginger?
2:07
Yeah. Okay, everybody good to begin?
2:12
All right. I understand. Wow. What an energy in the room. Uh I understand that
2:17
I am standing between you and your lunch break. So you know I better be quick and
2:21
efficient. Um a very very exciting welcome to the sessions on business
2:27
accounting. Did anybody get a chance to look at the course outline?
2:34
Just anybody like not like point by point but cursorily maybe the heading
2:40
the title of the course financial accounting. Very good. What do
2:46
I have here? What do I have here?
2:50
Business accounting. How do you think the two are different from each other?
2:55
The course is financial accounting. I am not in for it.
3:01
Business accounting is what we're going to do. How is financial accounting
3:04
different than business accounting? Come on. Are you clued on to your internets?
3:10
Can you ask chat giidity Google how is business accounting different than we
3:16
are going to use AI a lot in these classes we cannot avoid you know avoid
3:22
AI it's like 20 years 30 years ago you can't avoid emails you can't avoid
3:26
calculators you can't avoid excel these are new innovations every day
3:30
everybody's in the workplace they're using it so as a student we are going to
3:34
use them a lot but we have to learn how and when to use it Okay. So, what is the
3:40
answer that is coming up? Business accounting versus financial accounting.
3:51
Come on. Business accounting versus
3:56
Thank you. Yeah. What is GNI telling you?
4:08
Go ahead. Go ahead. It's a very safe space. Everybody don't unnecessarily
4:11
make an effort to sound right. No, you know, it's it's um of course as a
4:16
trainer we would love if you give the right answers. We absolutely welcome
4:20
even the answers which may not be like picture perfect. So safe space. Yes.
4:27
Okay. Um
4:31
go ahead. Go ahead. So
4:34
finance is external.
4:46
performance whereas businesses. Okay. Okay. Solid. The purpose the
4:52
purpose is different. Uh by the way where are you carrying your name tags?
4:56
Can you please bring them up? It'll be easier for us to communicate interact.
5:05
I'll introduce. Don't worry. introduce. Hang on.
5:16
As in, you're right. You're quite
5:24
Okay. Okay. Financial accounting is part of business
5:28
accounting. Okay. All right. Go ahead.
5:31
Financial accounting for like outsiders.
5:36
This one is for yourself. Okay. So I think the answer lies
5:41
somewhere in between. Let me collectively you know answer what we
5:45
have heard here. Financial accounting is very rule oriented. Business accounting
5:50
on the other hand is very logic oriented. Well both are accounting after
5:54
all and we are going to talk about what accounting is but financial reporting or
5:58
financial accounting or financial by different words called it is under the
6:03
set accounting standards. How do you present the performance of your business
6:07
to report to like many of you rightly said external stakeholders but the whole
6:12
exercise you lose the spirit of the game. The spirit of the game means why
6:16
are you doing the recording for who is the hero of the show? What is the unit
6:21
of analysis? The business. The business is the center point. So in these you
6:27
know 20 hours that we have with each other almost 70 80% times we will be
6:33
dedicating ourselves to understand the business who is doing what on the ground
6:39
because then once you know A is doing that B is doing this it is very easy to
6:42
write what A is doing and what B is so that's pretty much the focus of business
6:47
accounting is very different it is to understand the business first and then
6:51
just record few things what is happening financial reporting financial accounting
6:55
is too rule oriented. No. How many people here want to get a job of an
7:00
accountant after this course? Exactly. That's why there's no point on um you
7:05
know kind of teaching you rules etc etc. Well, let me tell you the connect
7:09
between the two when you drive at a fast pace. Let's say you are on a superbike.
7:15
Should you wear a helmet? Is it because of the logic or is it
7:19
because there is a rule? But there is a rule also. Do you see
7:23
that there is a logic of the rule as well? So point is when we say oh yeah I
7:29
have two choices I have to wear a helmet because somebody is telling me to or
7:33
somebody is logically telling me to and I see the merit in it. That's the latter
7:38
part is the business accounting really. So we are going to talk about a lot of
7:42
things which accountants do but we will talk about a lot of other stuff as well.
7:46
So financial accounting or business accounting is my favorite word is going
7:50
to further into a business planning module maybe next term going to get
7:54
further into uh management accounting in your third term in Singapore and will
7:58
further into corporate finance. So it's like the entire finance track. Okay. Um
8:04
my name is Ankur Kustra. I am a professionally trained chartered
8:07
accountant and uh charter financial analyst CFA you know um typically part
8:11
of capital markets. out of 100 units of my time uh about 40 spent in training
8:18
the young firms to become funding ready. Okay. What it means essentially is that
8:22
as entrepreneurs you guys are so much and absolutely you know that's the right
8:27
thing to do perhaps you are so much centered around your product that you
8:31
forget that there is a business that you're running. There is a difference
8:34
between running a successful product versus running a successful business. So
8:39
people like me will bring your focus out of the product back to business that
8:44
it's the business that should be successful not just one product it's
8:49
okay if one product works the other doesn't but as a business you should
8:52
know flounder so that's the business perspective that you know so about 40%
8:56
of my time goes there uh remaining 60% is into training investment banks like
9:01
Goldman Sachs standard charted and stuff like that uh into modules of capital
9:05
markets derivatives and stuff like that and uh I'm very excited about you know
9:10
the the portion of my time that come makes me travel to uh Dubai and
9:14
Singapore and stuff like that to meet very young entrepreneurs like you. Uh I
9:18
see so much energy I see so fundamental questions I see so amazing questions in
9:23
uh you know from each one of you. Uh so thank you very much for bringing that
9:27
youth and that excitement into our life. Otherwise you see the workplaces are
9:31
generally boring. So the moment you enter a tetar or or a master's union you
9:34
know where also I attend to uh there is so much excitement that you know get so
9:38
and um you know so it's it's a pros and cons a person who has one leg in
9:43
consulting in academics will bring a lot of real data into the classroom the
9:50
moment that happens advantage you don't get bored but it becomes very intense
9:56
the cases the textbook cases are very simple no a sold this thing to that with
10:01
a round number 850 but reality is very very unstructured very intense so
10:07
something happened in open AI and Oracle do you know what happened between the
10:12
two firms you have 60 seconds go to Google internet chatgity and make
10:17
yourself wiser what happened between these two open AI and Oracle something
10:21
happened very recently let's see how well can you use your chat
10:26
GBDs open AI organiz
10:59
Okay, so That's a good starting point. Thank you. Um, who is paying to whom
11:06
in the deal? Who is paying to whom? People don't look at my body language.
11:19
We are trained to confuse you so that you are fundamentally strong.
11:24
Who is paying to whom? Open AI is paying to Oracle. Okay. All
11:30
money at once. No. Then
11:34
over five years that means systematically if one has to reduce it
11:38
300 divided by five is 60 uh billion per year is what you know
11:45
and that means this much is the income for Oracle every year. My next question
11:51
is have Oracle started to deliver on the project or is it just the deal that has
11:56
been signed? Has Oracle started to work on the
12:00
project already? No, it's just the deal. It's just the
12:03
agreement that has been signed. Okay, fine. Let's better calling me and say
12:06
you know uh you and I get into the agreement that you come into. Today is
12:09
where the teaching begins. You know a month ago it was just an agreement on
12:14
the email. So this is the agreement that you have seen as a news item. Oracle has
12:18
not started to work. But then if actual on the ground there is no work
12:23
whatsoever, what has happened to the share price of Oracle?
12:27
It has skyrocketed. It has gone up by like 35%. Like even startups don't
12:33
increase their value by 30 you know 35% like that. So how do you think who are
12:37
those people? Are those people the same as the business people? No. The first
12:43
learning outcome everybody for an entrepreneur is what happens on the
12:46
ground is the business. But there is another room we call it stock exchange
12:51
capital markets etc. where people draw their perceptions about something that
12:56
perception has become positive and therefore in that room 35% valuation has
13:02
gone up on the ground not even an inch of work has happened so far it's just
13:06
two people coming together and say hey why don't you do it for me fine fine
13:09
I'll take so much okay fine agre agreement but the people in the room
13:13
sometimes create so much noise people in this room tend to get confused 35%
13:18
growth is not in the business it is only in the share
13:22
Sometimes people in that room we call it capital market. I'll also give you a
13:25
capital market. It will have a blue color. People unnecessarily make
13:29
conjectures and therefore when they make conjectures there is always a risk of
13:32
falling flat. So have you seen have you have you heard about a company called as
13:36
um as as as uh check okay um as by
13:45
online at tech one the know poster boys of a particular country. Wonderful
13:51
product, wonderful product for very bad business.
13:55
Okay. But you know people in that room and they were like oh my god you know
13:59
they can do this they can do this and suddenly from $1 billion to $2 billion
14:03
to $22 billion within a span of 18 months. Perception has no logic. It's
14:07
like writing a poem. That's what valuation is all about. You know how are
14:11
you feeling? I'm feeling very nice today. V valuation of by juice goes up.
14:14
But you see in that room $22 billion can become zero also at the same time.
14:18
Businesses don't move. They are like elephants. So people, you and I are not
14:22
going to talk about that capital market in this course. That is a separate
14:26
course on capital market which may happen in trimester 2, 3, 4, whatever.
14:29
This course is about what Oracle does for OpenAI on the ground. People on the
14:35
ground don't move like women fancies. It have to be a rock solid. It's like an
14:40
elephant. Elephants don't dance that way. So the business is something which
14:44
you and I have to be really focused on. If you understand business, who is doing
14:48
what? Accounting, I can tell you in half an hour. That's it. It's not more than
14:51
that. Are we together on that? All right. Um
14:57
working here. Uh very quickly everybody, I know
15:02
it's lunchtime. Uh what are your expectations? Not from this session, but
15:06
like overall 20 hours. What do you want to learn?
15:11
I swear we are taking four sections, but we can customize it according to your
15:14
section. Absolutely. If there is a unanimous conclusion that
15:19
you know we don't want to do this but want to do that we happy to modify it
15:22
for you. What do you want to learn? Go ahead.
15:26
Bookkeeping. Okay. How like how to read it and you know
15:30
like how to read it. You see this is
15:32
different. Bookkeeping means doing making the books. Reading means somebody
15:36
else has done it. I want to make and create an opinion out of that. Okay. So
15:39
these are two very different things. Okay. Fine. So reading of financial
15:41
statement. Absolutely.
15:46
So basic accounting functions have been completely outsourced to AI. Well, let
15:50
me correct myself. Even 10 years ago, it was outsourced to technology. In my
15:54
personal view, we are unnecessarily wanting to sound impressive and
15:58
therefore we are using AI to substitute for technology. Technology has been
16:01
there for last 30 35 years. Unnecessary every technology is not AI. So basic
16:07
functions have anyway been outsourced to a lot of technology fun. Okay. But with
16:10
AI the basic marketing function basic designing basic accounting basic HR
16:17
basic of everything has been outsourced to a machine it's very sad you know the
16:21
population of the planet is increasing but the work that they have to do is
16:25
decreasing okay so we will bring in a lot of AI uh but not really from the
16:30
point of view of technology but from the point of view of how it can make your
16:33
job easier while you're reading somebody's and so we'll do something
16:36
called as sentiment mapping we'll do something like you know if you're
16:39
reading an MD speech what are the key things that you have to figure out so
16:43
humans can also do that but it's just they take more time machines can do
16:46
those things faster so that we will do okay yeah more things
16:52
okay all right uh well that is going to be like a mix of strategy and marketing
16:57
and stuff like that but we will take a lot of examples using that we may not be
17:01
able to give you growth strategies how to hack growth and so on so forth um
17:06
yeah more like invest
17:09
sure sure All of that discussion will happen here. All of that. But you see,
17:12
you have to appreciate everybody. This is only 20 hours. So we can start a few
17:16
conversations. We may not be able to end every conversation is what I'm trying to
17:19
say. So success of a short course like this should not be measured in terms of
17:23
how many conversations are we able to end. But how many doubts or curiosities
17:27
have your mind started to generate now? That's a good good course you know to my
17:31
mind. Yes.
17:32
Thanks. Um um like government I'll also you uh we
17:39
may not be able to you know discuss much about taxes
17:45
fantastic that's exactly what Enso was also making a point how to read though
17:55
valuation of business again is going to come in one of the second courses but a
17:59
lot of fundamentals we will do here will help you do that 100%. % 100. This is
18:04
such a foundational course for anybody who wants to do like you know valuation
18:08
of a business wants to do VC term sheets and P and all that. Yes sir.
18:11
Are we going to learn about like errors and numbers?
18:14
Uh we do but that's really like the advanced level. I hope that the output
18:18
of the class is such that we can you get onto that level. Brilliant you know. So
18:22
uh I am very excited in case we are able to get to that level. So
18:26
maybe also I would be interested to learn how to use
18:32
100%. That's exactly what Yeah. Right. Enzo's point and I think that was
18:37
was um Pusha's point and Anun's point also was everybody I tell you my
18:40
expectations. It's not very fancy. It's not very impressive. It is very simple.
18:45
I want you to be very comfortable in talking about a business using numbers.
18:50
you know how CEOs, how entrepreneurs, uh, you know, how these, you know, big
18:55
daddies of those financial world talk about, they don't really talk about, um,
19:01
obviously they do talk about Trump all the time these days. Uh, but they in
19:04
addition to that they also talk about a lot of businesses and businesses while
19:09
you communicate you need a language. The language is accounting. So have you
19:13
heard about a word called as profit ever before? Which discipline gave you the
19:17
word profit? It was not economics. Economics gave utility. It was not
19:22
finance. Finance gave return. But the word profit came from another discipline
19:26
called as accounting. So that's the role of accounting in every business person's
19:30
life. It is the vocabulary using which that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. I
19:35
don't want to sound that you know accounting is the best course that can
19:39
happen to you ever. No, it's one of the thousand courses that will happen to
19:43
you. But it is a critical course because it will give you the very very you know
19:46
basic thing to talk about. All right everybody um
19:51
uh why is this missing sometimes? Okay. Um in the process uh I'm told by
19:58
the other two sections uh in the morning and I can I should I should be asking
20:02
how many people are actually seriously into their drop shipping
20:07
ventures. Very good. I think the hand raises are
20:11
the highest here. Congratulations. While you are in the venture as an
20:16
entrepreneur, I can guarantee some of these questions will come to your mind.
20:21
There's only one course in the world that can answer these questions. That is
20:25
accounting. These are not very hi-fi questions. These are very basic
20:30
fundamental question. But that's what accounting does fundamental job. It's
20:35
like watering the plant. Okay. The roots become stronger. That's about it. So
20:39
sometimes you know like man uh how is the work man we are selling like hot
20:43
cakes what are you saying you're always short on the cash and then you're
20:46
thinking how is it possible that on one hand my sales are so much but on the
20:51
other I'm always short on cash where is the reconciliation between the two and
20:55
accounting understanding can help you bridge the gap sometimes you're like you
21:00
know last year I raised money from my family this year I raised put in so much
21:03
of my money how much money has gone into the business so far is there a Okay. Uh
21:09
yeah, there is something in accounting that can help you figure out the owner's
21:12
money in the business. Am I using that money? Oh, basically you're talking
21:16
about how much profit you're generating for yourself. Ah, we have a ratio called
21:19
as return on equity. Okay, so on so forth. So there is there are a lot of
21:23
questions that you might come through answers you will find you know in this
21:28
course and like I say that this is not a course which is absolutely free of uh
21:34
it's not going to be a cakewalk. We bring a lot of realism into the class.
21:38
Makes the class more irritating. Makes the class more unstructured. Makes the
21:42
class more unsistatic but makes the class very relevant. This is not going
21:47
to be a textbook. I don't think there is even one example that I have out of a
21:51
textbook. In fact, this is the second time that I am at Teta. Last year also
21:55
the drop shipping ventures. So some of the examples that I have are actually
21:59
after speaking to the groups. So like can I just take some information and the
22:04
group happily volunteered all that information what does have been put as a
22:10
question and will be given to you. So now you know that actually how does the
22:13
journey of a drop shipping and so on so forth you know happens but yeah I have
22:17
to have to confess there are sometimes the reputation precedes you. A lot of
22:22
people think accounting is like ulcer over an you know a pimple. It has too
22:27
you know too many bad things in it. Some people think, "Oh my god, too many
22:30
numbers. I've always been a, you know, uh, qualitative guy. I can describe
22:35
things, but numbers I hate." And so on and so forth. So in that case, uh, let
22:40
me kind of clear this doubt. Are we ready for a quick rapid fire?
22:46
15 into * * 7 is equal to
22:54
105 into 7
22:59
is equal to now 105 is the right answer. Question is
23:05
not if you know the ear and you can recall it. The question is if you don't
23:09
know how can you train your mind to work towards that. So the question was 15
23:16
into 7 correct answer is 105 very few people will recall it very frankly you
23:22
know but can you train your mind how best can you do it how best can you
23:27
multiply the two numbers train your mind people that's how the more adult you
23:31
become the more blunt your mind is going to be thanks to social media it is
23:35
depleting at an increasing rate okay and then when you're 40 it'll become all so
23:40
cloudy so you have to train your mind to handle that cloudiness.
23:44
Let's see how what is the best way to arrive at this. One is obviously by
23:47
memory like many people did. Good job done. But I'm interested in the adult
23:51
way of thinking. 15 * 7. What how would you do?
23:54
Uh so 15 * 10 is 150. 15 * 10
24:01
then and then the half of it is 75.
24:07
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I get it. Um, is there a duster that I can get? Uh, is
24:13
this cloth okay? Uh, it's very dirty. Can you get a proper duster?
24:23
Uh, but I'll have to use it maybe. Can you see if you can arrange it
24:28
from here? Okay. Uh, okay. All right. So, what you did is 15 * 10 divided by
24:34
2. This will be 15 * 5 75 plus 15 * 2 uh is going to be 30.
24:44
That's one way. What is the other way? 150 - 15.
24:50
Very good. 15 * 10 - 15 * 3. So 10 - 3 that's also 7.
24:56
What else? 7 * 5
24:59
35. Very good. Absolutely wonderful. So 7 * 5 is 35 and
25:06
7 * 10 is 70. 70 + 35 is also 105. 7 * 5 is 35.
25:16
There are multiple ways is what I'm trying to say everybody. This is what is
25:20
training your mind. Nobody wants to make you a mathematician and uh this is not a
25:25
program you know really to become but that's the level of mathematics and we
25:29
will use a lot of excel and all those stuff you know whenever we have to uh
25:32
worry about these things so here is what you have to do and you can do especially
25:36
how many people are from non-commerce background like humanities science stem
25:40
and all of that okay uh quite a lot the content has been prepared and curated
25:44
for you guys so there are some pre-watch videos mapped in your course outline
25:49
please make sure that you go through them. Tomorrow we are going to talk
25:53
about something called as legal forms of business. How many commercees have uh
25:58
heard about sole proprietorship partnerships? You see hand raises now
26:04
non-commerce people in case you want to have confident discussion with these
26:09
people. Those videos have very small introduction of those topics. So it will
26:15
not really discuss too many things. It's a short video 7 minutes 12 minutes
26:20
YouTube into two times you can watch save time but it will give you a lot of
26:24
confidence to enter the classroom and so that the discussion can be case- wise.
26:27
Are we together on that? Okay. All right.
26:31
80/20 is my favorite ratio. You know what does 8020 means? 80% of times you
26:35
guys work only 20% time is my effort your work. Why don't you explain?
26:42
Anybody volunteer? Just read it, summarize it, volunteer to
26:51
explain. Thank you.
27:09
Who's going to volunteer? So is when you learn a language, you
27:12
don't have to memorize the whole entire Very good. Uh that's what I do like I
27:17
just memorize the things I use the most and actually like start combining.
27:22
Fantastic. Fantastic. So 20% of the effort makes 80% of the
27:26
results. That's exactly the peritor rule. Very
27:28
good. But which 20% are most important ones? Is the identification of that is
27:33
most important. Yes sir. Complex ideas can be broken down from
27:37
two. Wonderful.
27:39
Wonderful. That you see imagine I'm just going to give you some broad numbers. I
27:43
have 20 slides today. This is just one of the se sessions into 13 250 slides in
27:49
the course just one of the course in one of the terms over 3 and a half years
27:54
minimum you will see minimum 100 courses. So imagine 250 slides into 100.
28:00
Oh my god those are the slides that will be shown to you. Impossible is to kind
28:05
of memorize everything. You have to identify those 5% 1% 2% important
28:12
concepts which you can't afford to miss. I have two such concepts today. Two such
28:16
concepts which you cannot afford to miss. I will identify that this is a
28:19
slide that you can't afford to miss. Are we together? Should we move on? Um
28:25
the first task that I have for all of you go to chat GBTS Google wherever you
28:30
can. You have 5 minutes. Speak to the person sitting next to you. What do you
28:33
have to do? A lay person, somebody who is not from accounting and finance
28:38
background tend to use these fives interchangeably.
28:42
Your task is you have to identify how are these different from each other. Is
28:49
a task clear? Sometimes when a lay person sometimes an entrepreneur also
28:54
wanting to say business, they use the word finance. They want to say finance,
28:58
they use the word accounting. How are these five different from each other?
29:02
That's what the task is. You can use chat GPD but the point is what they say
29:09
you need to understand. Okay.
29:14
One more question. Are we going to learn how to invest investors like imagine how
29:19
many short time they make questions? Correct. Lot of fundamentals that you
29:23
have to use there you will learn from here like EITA like profit margins like
29:28
return on all of that is going to come here.
29:33
Everybody, four and a half minutes. You want Okay.
30:05
4 minutes. Yeah,
30:19
maybe you should speak to the person sitting next. But unless you give your
30:23
output, you would not know how wrong or right
30:26
you are. business.
30:53
Thank you. Two and a half more minutes.
31:40
They can also business
32:09
Okay. production.
32:38
60 seconds. Definitely accounting.
32:52
Certainly not accounting. Really?
32:53
No. Your favorite and my favorite is going
33:02
to be same. We'll figure out
33:08
30 seconds. You can take a seat. Yeah.
33:26
Are we ready everybody? Okay. Um, allow me to begin by a question.
33:34
Which of these five has the largest scope?
33:43
Which out of these five has the largest scope?
33:48
Like scope. You understand, right? Like the overall size, the overall umbrella
33:52
is the largest economy or business.
34:00
You see that's a very good news for me that the debate is only between two out
34:04
of five. That means everybody understand accounting is not the largest. Everybody
34:08
understand finance is not the largest. It's a very good start. Congratulations.
34:13
Okay. Economy
34:16
is the first option. Let's debate on that. What is economy? Give me the key
34:20
word. And we are not in for any theoretical definition. What is economy?
34:25
Give me the key word. System. Very good.
34:28
Markets. Markets. And
34:32
in a global global region.
34:36
Very good. So that means it is region agnostic. Agnostic as in irrelevant. So
34:41
it could be an economy of just Dubai. It could be economy of UAE. It could be of
34:46
Middle East. It could be Asia pack and so on so forth.
34:49
Micro and macroeconomy. Micro and macro are the different
34:52
bifurcations. And is it now understand uh this
34:56
question carefully. Is it microeconomy and macroeconomy versus microeconomics
35:05
and macroeconomics? Economics.
35:08
This micro macro is division of economy or economics?
35:13
Economics. Economics.
35:16
What is economics? Very good. So while studying you said it
35:21
there are too many things to study. Let me divide it into two parts. micro,
35:26
individuals and macro everybody put together aggregates while studying.
35:32
Okay, I'm still here. Who are the players on in in economy?
35:36
Who are the players? Very good.
35:41
Business. Can I use a better word within economics? We call them
35:45
producers. Producers or we can also call them
35:47
firms. Okay.
35:51
And households. Very good. consumers and government.
35:56
Very good. Fantastic. Each of them is doing what?
36:00
There is an answer on the board. Each of them is doing what?
36:02
Business. Very good. That's the point. That means
36:04
what is business? Activity of making
36:11
activity. Activity in which what are you doing?
36:18
Goods or service? No. But there is a household also.
36:21
Household don't sell. They buy. What is business?
36:27
Transaction. Somebody said, Somebody said trade. Wonderful. What is a trade?
36:32
Simple meaning. Give and take. Give and take.
36:37
Maybe a money. Maybe something else. Now practical examples application. In this
36:41
very room, there are four businesses who are engaged in a trade. First of
36:48
all, identify four businesses in this very room.
36:54
Tet number one. Number two, all right, good job. Actually, there are
37:01
five now. Okay. So, professor,
37:06
professor, the trainer, students, very good.
37:10
And technical employee.
37:14
There are five key stakeholders engaged in a trade transaction. Trade means give
37:20
and take. And it's very simple. A trade is beneficial when what you give is dash
37:27
than what you receive. Less than what you should get.
37:32
Absolutely. The value of what you give has to be less than what you receive.
37:36
Now think about it everybody. What are you giving? You are the business. What
37:39
are you giving and what are you getting? You are giving money. They call it fees.
37:45
You call it money. Correct? So time. Brilliant. And one more thing, effort.
37:52
You're trying. You see yourself, you're putting so much effort. Good job. This
37:56
is what you give. What you get? Knowledge.
37:59
Knowledge. You are going to continue to be in these classes, in this term, in
38:02
this course, in this program. Only when you think what you get is more than what
38:07
you give. Do you see the Mark Zuckerberg dropped
38:10
out of his his education? Why do you think somebody chose not to be in the
38:15
class when he thought what I give is more valuable than what I am receiving?
38:22
It's a lossmaking trade for me. Let me not do it. Are we together on that?
38:27
Okay. All right. Uh what am I getting and giving?
38:30
No, you're giving knowledge. No, no, you're very kind that you think
38:33
what I'm giving is knowledgeable. I'm only very good. I'm giving time
38:37
number one. Number two, effort.
38:38
Effort. Brilliant. Okay, that's it. Experience.
38:42
Oh, experience is translating through the time and effort. Okay, all that
38:46
stuff. And what am I getting? Money and some gratification. Just to
38:52
make it look more rosy. But in terms of trade, it is the money. Okay, show me
38:56
the money kind of a thing. That's what uh what is she giving?
39:02
Time services. What is she getting? Money. Some people move jobs. Why do
39:07
they move job? Because what they think is what they're getting salary,
39:10
compensation, whatever you may call it, that's not important. Is less valuable
39:14
than what they give. Let's say time and effort. So on so forth. A what are they
39:18
getting? Money. They call it rent. And what are
39:22
they giving? Classrooms. What is the opportunity
39:25
cost? So on so forth. They are going to continue. So all of them are businesses.
39:29
Are we together on that? Is it necessary? Because you guys are doing
39:33
fabulous job. Okay. Better than the previous two sections. Uh I am
39:37
volunteering for this question. Is it necessary that every business ends up
39:41
making a profit? No.
39:43
No. It's a reality of the game. Is it therefore
39:48
an obvious thing? The first lossm transaction you should back out.
39:51
No. That's also no. Now again that's a
39:53
decision-m thing. Where do you see decision making of the business
39:58
happening? There is a word written there.
40:00
That's it. What is finance? Finance is decision making related to obviously the
40:08
business. How many people have seen Mission
40:13
Impossible the latest of the franchisee? Okay. How did you find it? Sorry, I
40:17
missed your name. Uh uh can I copy this expression? Okay. Now you know she said
40:23
uh now can you read this? Uh
40:30
now if somebody has to take a decision that you know I have an evening free and
40:33
therefore 3 hours I can go and watch Mission Impossible. Uh hey how did you
40:37
like it? She said uh is that communicating the emotion objectively?
40:43
No. How uh is her for us is not imagine if her answers would have been I didn't
40:50
like it. I think it is 4 on 10. Now four on 10 for the world means four on 10.
40:57
That's the power of numbers. That's where finance comes in. That's actually
41:02
why finance was invented by economics. Finance is the baby of economics is the
41:07
mother. Marketing was also the baby of the economics as a mother. The
41:11
difference is marketing may we look at everything from consumer's lens. In
41:16
finance we look at everything from money monetary lens. So monetary lens it's
41:20
easy to communicate. Are we together on that? Okay, so far we have missed out
41:24
the hero of the show and uh Priscilla. Yes. Uh she was hoping
41:30
that I'll say she asked me a question which is which one is your favorite? I
41:33
said certainly not accounting. What is accounting?
41:39
What is accounting? Record. Okay.
41:45
Summarizing. Ah don't give me that definition.
41:48
Summarizing, analyzing, classifying blah blah blah. It is such a pathetic
41:51
definition. It's right on the one hand. Record. Record what?
41:56
Record what? The answer is there on the board.
41:59
Record not finance. Finance.
42:02
Business. People finance tells business what to
42:08
do. Business does that thing. And then account record it. You don't record your
42:14
plan. You record your actions. There's a difference in it. Which phone should I
42:19
buy? part of finance you're deciding fine let's buy let's say iPhone 17 you
42:26
go to the shop and actually buy iPhone 17 that's business that's where trade
42:31
happens you come home write it in your diary I paid so many dollars paid so
42:36
many dollars through credit card so blah blah blah that's accounting are we
42:40
together which according to you to answer the question my favorite
42:45
certainly is here people because especially for this
42:49
class. There is no purpose of being a good accountant unless what you can make
42:54
sense who is doing what that business is going to hold the key for you all the
42:59
time. Focus on business accounting will come naturally.
43:04
Have you seen this guy in news for right and wrong reasons
43:09
both? Good businessman
43:14
and there is a lot of podcast culture these days.
43:19
Right. a podcast. Has anybody
43:23
been on a podcast or have interviewed somebody? lot of you know like 10 years
43:27
ago nobody really thought of you know that as a way of communicating one of
43:32
the podcast somebody says you are such a great guy you know and this happened
43:35
before the Oracle open when he was he used to be the richest person and you
43:39
have such you know terrific businesses you've built look at Tesla Motors uh
43:43
look at your uh SpaceX so on and so forth and how do you look at businesses
43:50
how do you kind of transform an idea into like something so big he said well
43:55
I am very lucky. Number one, he said it. I'm very lucky. For a good business to
43:59
prosper, one has to be very lucky. Okay, we can't undermine the impact of it. But
44:03
because that's uncontrollable, no point of discussing that in the class. That's
44:07
why not many people just kind of discuss about being good businessmen is being
44:11
lucky. But it's super important. Imagine the government that you have paid so
44:15
much money to open up a plant suddenly changes because of something. You know,
44:19
a lot of political oppress global geopolitical confusions everywhere. So
44:23
luck is important. But other than luck, he said, I look at my businesses into
44:28
six different components.
44:32
Each of these six components have stakeholders.
44:36
There are multiple people I interact with. And by I he meant business.
44:42
We are not asking this is not the component of Elon Musk.
44:48
These are of a business. Let's say Tesla Teta.
44:54
Just you have 60 seconds to quickly read through A B CDE E and then we start with
44:59
the application. This is no textbook. This is Elon Musk.
45:12
First A has to happen, then B happens, then C happens, and then followed by D.
45:16
If at all you're successful, then E and F will happen.
45:33
so fundamental so simple so basic is that I look at all the time and I have
45:37
stakeholders appointed in each of them have you read it through okay I'm not
45:42
going to go and explain I'm going to pick up a business called as tr
45:48
is a business, right? M is a business. You as a business, I am a business. For
45:53
Tetar as a business, where do you see me in this framework?
46:08
A trainer, a professor. Where do you see me?
46:14
It's a safe space. Whatever comes to your mind, just speak up.
46:19
B for Bombay. Okay.
46:22
And some people also initially said D for Delhi.
46:29
Okay. Confusion. Next. Where do you see yourself?
46:33
What would be you know remember during the orientation
46:38
we said uh we will invest so much in you blah blah etc.
46:45
So where do you see people? This is no stage show. This is no pepup talk. This
46:51
is hardcore business. Where do you see yourself a teta?
46:57
You guys are here. Has they might say that they invest in
47:03
you blah blah blah etc. Have they bought you? No. The yellow box are full of
47:09
those items which they have purchased, they have bought, they have spent their
47:14
money on. So think about it. Have they bought me?
47:18
No. They have hired me for my jobs. So that's where I am.
47:26
Where do you see this marker for Teta?
47:34
Is this marker from where Tetar raises money?
47:37
No. Is this the marker the place where Tetar spends money?
47:42
Yes. And they make their the marker own. So these are all legally owned stuff.
47:49
And great that you raised Emity's example. Where do you see this building?
47:56
Where do you see this building in context? People application is
48:00
everything. I can give you thousand frameworks. No meaning.
48:06
Is the building legally owned? No. Can't come in yellow box. As simple
48:10
as that. Only the legally owned things can come in the yellow box. But then
48:15
even if you don't own something, it has a cost of usage. What is the cost of
48:20
usage called of things that you don't own?
48:22
Rent. So rent is a name given for fundamentally cost of using some asset
48:28
which you don't own. So can I say that emit is here
48:35
and ma'am what would be a good name? Joanna.
48:38
Joanna. Where do you see Joanna? Here D
48:44
for Delhi. Absolutely. All employees are here.
48:49
Sorted. Do you see Pratam Mittal? What is Pratam Mittal in context to
48:55
Teta? Founder.
48:57
Founder. Founder means what? But founder does what?
49:02
Founder brings in the initial money. Founder brings in the in obviously he's
49:07
working hard and everything. But he is the person from whom the money is
49:11
raised. This is the blue box. You know what you and I call it as capital
49:14
markets. Have you heard about investment banks, hedge funds, commercial banks
49:19
like Wells Fargo, Qatar National Bank and stuff like that? All those places
49:23
where you can raise money is that blue box. Financial market, stock exchange,
49:27
mutual funds, everybody is here. It's a clutter full of it. People who do MBA
49:32
finance spend their life in the blue box. So this is where you will find
49:37
Pratam Mittal also. Tetar is funded through private equity.
49:43
Where do you find that private equity? Tetar is funded through private equity.
49:50
Where do you find private equity's name? Yellow box, blue box.
49:56
Blue, blue, blue,
49:59
blue box. Anywhere where the money is raised is blue box. So if you have a
50:06
business idea, how do you start? You raise the money first. Welcome to the
50:10
blue box. You go to anybody to raise money. That's part of the blue box. Now
50:15
money is with you. The business tet where will tetar spend the money?
50:20
They will buy the markers. They will buy let's say are these chairs
50:24
emmets or yours? Emmites. Therefore, will where will you
50:28
see the chair? Can the chair come in the yellow box?
50:32
No. The rent for the chair is going to come in D for Delhi. Are you with me on
50:38
that? The bifurcation between B for Bombay versus D for Delhi. All right.
50:41
Good. Um commercial bank who has given money on loan to Teta
50:47
Bluebox. Again you see every time you talk about raising funding you are going
50:52
to blue box a tetar bought a camera the camera B for Bombay uh Tetar have
51:01
bought some water bottles to be supplied to trainers
51:06
B for Bombay that also is a legal you know legally owned resources fantastic
51:11
I'm going to put some numbers okay you are doing much much better
51:15
don't ask me compared to what it'll unnecessary create friction. $100
51:21
you gave to Teta. $80 everybody of us took. What should you
51:29
call this 20? Number one, it is called as profit. What
51:34
else can a lay person call it? What else can this 20 be called as
51:40
returns? What else can be called as utility?
51:46
Now whether it's gross or net or but it is a profit profit can also be called as
51:52
people why are you so accounting oriented you have to be business
51:55
oriented in business sometimes we use the word sometimes we use the word
51:59
surplus fantastic we use the word surplus
52:03
surplus very good what else earnings
52:08
wins um win is more like a transaction to the deal in of amount
52:13
earnings earnings brilliant
52:17
Can I call it surplus? Can I call it gains? Can I call it returns? Anything
52:22
mean the same? Is this 20? Have you already paid me?
52:26
Yes. Have you already paid to emit? Have you already paid to uh young lady
52:32
sitting? Everybody has been paid except
52:37
except the initial people from whom you have
52:41
raised the money. Where are they? The blue box. So the question is $20 the
52:47
surplus that you have, what should a business do? Two things business can do.
52:52
Number one, they can always go and return the money back to them. Thank you
52:55
very much, Pratamita. You gave us some $500 initially. Hypothetically, let's
52:59
say $500 initially. Here is some extra, you know, that we generated that belongs
53:05
to you. What if uh teter had a point? Let's say hypothetical examples. Uh
53:11
where do you see this marker? I'm writing the word marker here. Okay.
53:16
I'm putting $5 as the price. Fair point.
53:22
After the first year, that means for the second year, Teter realized that I want
53:28
more markers. That means they have to go to the market to spend money. $5. First
53:33
option, they go back to the blue box. Pratam, can I borrow more $500 uh and
53:39
buy marker? That's what they did a year ago as well. going to the blue box and
53:43
raising money. That's called as external funding. Okay. But you see how much
53:48
money has Tetra generated last year through their own extra good efforts?
53:53
100. $20.
53:55
80 has already been spent. 20 is what is lying on the table. If Tetar uses this
54:01
20, goes to the shop, buys one marker of $5,
54:08
which one of these two markers was funded externally and which one is
54:11
internally? The first one was externally second one.
54:15
No, I have the marker in my hand. Which one is externally funded versus
54:20
which one is internally funded? By looking at the yellow box, can you
54:24
figure out the blue one? By looking at the bottle,
54:30
this is the yellow box for Teta. Okay. Uh, has this been $5. Have this been
54:35
purchased using external promat funding or was it purchased out of the own
54:39
resources by looking at it?
54:42
We cannot. We cannot tell. That's the point. The
54:45
yellow box, that's what Elon Musk is saying. My asset side is independent of
54:50
my funding side. It is so difficult for businessmen to delineate the two. This
54:57
is what you have to learn. What you raise the money from is the blue box.
55:00
It's a separate dimension. It's very active, very romantic, very busy. But
55:04
your yellow box have nothing to do with it. You during the break you'll some
55:09
people will go and buy something you know for lunch. Will the shopkeeper ever
55:13
ask you is it your money or is it private equity's money or is it credit
55:16
card? No. For them it's just a sale. You can buy anything this $5 using anybody's
55:22
money and by looking at the resource you can never tell. Are you with me on that?
55:26
Okay. All right. Step number F. Step number F is a
55:34
perfect substitute of which step. Either I do F or I do that. Fantastic.
55:43
There's $20 of surplus. Either I can reinvest in the business and buy more of
55:48
the assets or I can give it back for gratification. Are we together on that?
55:52
Okay. You're doing a good job. and practical application. Just read the
55:57
first two columns people. This is what I meant when you
56:14
bring the real news. Sometimes it is unstructured, sometimes it is sketchy.
56:23
Let me just read the first two columns. A lay person after looking at the
57:02
headline will say, "Oh, the project has been closed. The project has been
57:05
shelved." Has the project been sheld off?
57:10
Person with the business and finance understanding will know the difference.
57:13
What is the name of the business? What is the name of the business?
57:21
You see the framework is applied on a business. We applied it on Teta. What is
57:25
the name of the business in this news? Very good.
57:32
Adani ports and special economic zone. Gotamadani is not the business. He's
57:36
just the founder of the business. You're always creating framework for the
57:39
business, not business person. Okay. So here Adani ports and special economic
57:47
zone is your business. Okay. What is the blue
57:53
box of this business? Where were they raising money from?
57:57
Very how much money were they raising?
58:03
53 553. Let's say 550.
58:08
And were they keeping it all with them or were they utilizing it? Obviously no
58:12
business will like to keep it with them. They will like to spend where what is
58:16
the yellow box for them. Where what is the yellow box in the Elon
58:23
Musk framework? That is the place where business will spend the money. Where is
58:28
this business spending the money? West.
58:32
Colbo West International Terminal. Columbbo West International Terminal. Uh
58:38
are they using the word Or are they using some other word?
58:44
Project. Fantastic. The yellow box can also be referred to as project people.
58:50
You will meet as teter tribe. You will meet minimum say minimum 500 speakers.
58:57
CXOs, CIOS, CTO's, founders, trainers, professors,
59:03
influencers, everybody will follow a different vocabulary.
59:08
That's why as a student, as a learner, it becomes so hodgepodge and confusing.
59:12
Only one thing can you know bring peace in your in your mind is your strength of
59:16
fundamentals. The fundamentals the stronger you are. So some CX will say
59:21
you know that project that we were investing in you must know oh the
59:24
project means oh that's the yellow box that they must be spending some money.
59:28
It should automatically trigger a question in your brain that if they're
59:30
spending so much money where will they raise the money? Connect open AI and
59:35
Oracle. How much money is OpenAI paying? 600 $300 billion dollar uh into some
59:43
infrastructure. That's their yellow box. But for a business to spend so much
59:47
money in the yellow box before the yellow box has to be another blue box.
59:51
So it should automatically trigger a question if is OpenI making huge profits
59:55
or they still into losses as a startup. Initial stages they still into losses.
1:00:01
In case committing to pay 300, they must raise 300. That's the comfort with which
1:00:08
you should start reading the news. Every news will not capture everything. But
1:00:12
you should as a business reader have those open-ended points. Though
1:00:18
the key point, what change has happened? Uh they don't have the funding anymore.
1:00:24
So that external funding, you are half right. They don't have the
1:00:29
funding anymore. Good. But that means if IDFC says sorry I can't give you the
1:00:35
money that means the project is closed but you
1:00:39
just said the project is not closed. Where is the money coming from?
1:00:42
External funding. Read it. Read it. Where is
1:00:49
internal funding? Where do you say where do you see
1:00:52
internal funding? Adani port said that means the business the project will now
1:00:57
be funded. My yellow box will now be funded through internal resources. What
1:01:01
do you mean by internal resources? What do you mean by internal resources?
1:01:10
Step number E,
1:01:14
that surplus of $20 is being poured back into the business and buy new assets. So
1:01:21
that means external blue box is out, internal funding is in.
1:01:29
So far so good. It came as a question in the previous session.
1:01:34
Does that mean therefore a company which is in the business in the first year
1:01:39
cannot have reinvestment? Because for the reinvestment to happen
1:01:44
there must be some kind of a profits of the previous years.
1:01:48
So let's say you guys start your venture. Okay. Have you started your
1:01:51
venture? External funding or previous year's
1:01:54
profit. trying to get
1:01:58
Can you have previous year's profit? No. Because there was no previous year.
1:02:04
Okay. Such firms will not have E in their life. E for elephant. Similarly,
1:02:08
have you know there's a company called as Uber.
1:02:11
In multiple countries they are and in most often they're not their operations
1:02:15
are into losses. If they are into losses out of these
1:02:20
five out of these six which steps are not possible? E F
1:02:25
E and F are not possible then. So therefore if Adani is saying that I'm
1:02:31
going to fund the project using my internal approval. It is telling you two
1:02:34
things. Number one they have a past and not only they have a past they have a
1:02:41
very profitable past. Think about it. If it was the first year
1:02:45
of Adani there was no last year. The internal approval will not be there.
1:02:49
Correct? Plus if they had a past but it was a lossmaking past like Flipkart in
1:02:53
India like Amazon in most of the countries even in Dubai it is grossly
1:02:57
lossmaking they pay so much salary so much you know what is a loss essentially
1:03:02
when D is more than C that's what a loss is most startups and I'm sure when you
1:03:08
will be you know let's say neck deep into your ventures you will also realize
1:03:12
that yeah I am able to sell but I can't control my expenses which is my pink box
1:03:16
out there. So expense control also becomes you know one of the activities
1:03:20
so on so forth. So this news item does not say that the project has been
1:03:25
closed. It only says that your new source of funding has come in.
1:03:30
That's it. So far so good everybody. Okay up for last 5 minutes. Do you like
1:03:39
need a 1 minute break? You want to check your phones?
1:03:43
Do you want to find out if there is an emergency in the world? Donald Trump has
1:03:48
said something and the world needs you to fix it. This is the time. This is the
1:03:53
time you quickly go and check your Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn. Some
1:03:58
major thing would have happened. We have five more minutes of class left. That's
1:04:02
it. Five more minutes. This is a 30-second WhatsApp break.
1:04:11
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Um, can I also get some water?
1:04:15
Uh maybe you can bring another bottle. Is that a possibility?
1:04:18
Do you want me to fill it? Is that a possibility? Thank
1:04:21
you very much. 20 seconds.
1:04:59
10 seconds. airport.
1:06:02
Okay, everybody, let's begin because we are hitting on the closing time.
1:06:10
And um what time is your lunch break going to begin? 1:15. 130
1:06:15
130 130
1:06:17
It's already half over I have 18 more minutes, right?
1:06:22
Yeah. It is more than enough.
1:06:25
But I want you to have the next level of peace in your mind because this slide
1:06:31
again is going to be that 3 to 12 core principles that you cannot afford to
1:06:35
miss. So far you have done Elon Musk sixstep framework.
1:06:39
People don't mind if I bore you to death by reminding you even in the 13th
1:06:44
session what was the framework's yellow box. The colors have been put
1:06:49
deliberately so that you can recall. Okay, this slide resonate with which box
1:06:57
of Elon Musk framework. Blue or yellow or pink?
1:07:02
Blue. Blue.
1:07:02
How do you know blue? Capital
1:07:04
because this is where the capital coming in. This is where the funding is. So a
1:07:08
business wants to raise money. A business wants to raise money. Two
1:07:14
broad options. First option is outsiders money. We call it debt. What
1:07:21
is debt? Can somebody explain? What is debt?
1:07:24
When you owe somebody money. When you owe somebody.
1:07:31
Very good. Brilliant point. When you have to give back. So here is what Myra
1:07:36
has mentioned and imagine I am Teta okay the business you all are part of the
1:07:42
blue box. You all are part of the blue box. One of
1:07:49
you is a private equity firm. One of you is a venture capital. One of you is a
1:07:52
commercial bank. All of you have money and you are looking for good investment
1:07:56
opportunity. A candidate walks in like a shark tank and I am the business called
1:08:00
a statter. Myra and on on her right are people who are interested to give money
1:08:06
only against commitment. Meaning if I have to raise if I have to raise money
1:08:12
let's say $200 they are happy to give me some money provided I make a promise of
1:08:18
repayment. They need a commitment. So I said okay
1:08:22
fine terms and conditions. We have terms and conditions in everything. So I said,
1:08:25
"So um can I just take $200 and here is my terms and condition? You
1:08:32
will give me $200 today." Signed. I will repay after 20 years. Signed till the
1:08:38
time I am using your $200. I will continue to pay 7%.
1:08:43
I will want to use the word interest. You all understand interest. But I want
1:08:48
to use the word rent on capital. Think about it. What is interest? Isn't
1:08:54
it rent on capital is is this entire infrastructure um
1:09:01
tettors? No, it is ems. Somebody whenever they use somebody else's money,
1:09:05
they have to pay some rent. That interest is nothing but rent on capital.
1:09:08
So coming back to the agreement, I will uh you will pay give me $200 today. I
1:09:13
will pay after 20 years till then I will pay 7%. So $200 time 7% is equal to
1:09:22
7% of 200 is easy. You don't have to rush. $200
1:09:28
times 7%. How much is 1% of 200?
1:09:36
Two multiplied by 7. 14.
1:09:39
14. Okay. That's how you train your mind. $14 is what I have to pay to her
1:09:44
with what frequency annually. She says, "No, not acceptable. You have to pay me
1:09:48
every quarter." I says, "Okay, now $14 divided by four is how much?"
1:09:56
$14ide by two is 7. 7 divided by 2 is
1:10:00
3.5. That means this is the term written. Annual rent is 7%.
1:10:07
Comma paid quarterly. Is this the term clear? And then I signed it and I gave
1:10:13
it to Myra. Now that is an obligation on my head.
1:10:18
Welcome to debt. So Myra is here. Sorry. M Y M M
1:10:27
A Y R A. I went out of the room thinking that I
1:10:33
have enough and then I looked at my project and like no no the money fell
1:10:36
short. I entered the room again. this time this side has already gone home.
1:10:42
There are other people and this time they appeared more flexible. I said,
1:10:46
"Hey, I'm here to raise some money." They're like, "Yeah, yeah, of course, of
1:10:48
course." Uh, but and how much money? I I want some $100
1:10:54
and what are the terms and conditions on which you know the trading will happen,
1:10:57
the money will be lent. Uh, I said, "I have already given so much commitment to
1:11:01
them. I can't give you any commitment." So, just imagine um let's say Enzo. Enzo
1:11:08
is the person, the second person I'm dealing with. Enzo gives me $100 of his
1:11:11
own. And Enzo is looking for terms and conditions. So Enzo, I am taking a paper
1:11:16
and I'm going to write a terms and conditions. You are going to give me
1:11:19
$100 to me today. Fine. Sign. I will repay. I don't know when. Full
1:11:25
stop. Sign. No commitment. Till the time I'm using your money, Enzo, I will pay
1:11:31
how much rent on capital? Not committed. Sign. And here is the agreement. Now
1:11:37
imagine Enzo said what is this? You have taken my $100 and given me what?
1:11:42
Nothing. At least Myra has some commitment coming from me. And remember
1:11:47
trade was always give and take. You give some, you you know you lose some. Here
1:11:51
Enzo has got nothing. I have given no commitment whatsoever. Enzo says no
1:11:56
deal. I was like no no no I need the money. I need the money. I have to give
1:11:58
Enzo something. Uh Enzo let's do something. You become my owner. I give
1:12:03
you my ownership. Ownership means what? What? Equity is how you measure it in.
1:12:10
But ownership gives you access to what? Number one, the profits. If at all I
1:12:16
generate any surplus tomorrow, that will become, you know, will come to Enzo.
1:12:19
What else? The control, the right to take
1:12:22
decisions. These are the two things that Myra does not have. But what Myra has is
1:12:26
my commitment to pay 14 divided by 4, $3.5 every quarter.
1:12:35
What Enzo has is no commitment but the control over the firm. These are the two
1:12:40
broad sources of raising money. Okay. Today the blue box is very cluttered.
1:12:45
This equity and debt is of the time where Apple and Blackberry were just
1:12:49
fruits. You know, today they do a lot of other things. Today you have equity
1:12:54
product that smells like debt. Today you have a debt product that behaves like
1:12:57
equity. But if one has to be pure white and pure black, these were the two
1:13:02
funding sources. So can I just ask you a question about Myra and Enzo? Which one
1:13:06
of the two are taking more risk? Enzo,
1:13:10
of course. What is the rate at which I was raising money from Myra?
1:13:13
Seven. Seven. That means seven is what for her
1:13:17
return. That's her return. He has given the money and therefore she's earning
1:13:21
7%. If Myra is earning 7%. What do you think Enzo's expected return
1:13:27
from me will be? Higher or lower? Higher.
1:13:30
Why higher? Because he's taking more.
1:13:31
Because he's taking more risk. Fair point. Is it fair to say that return
1:13:34
from equity is higher than return from debt?
1:13:37
How much more is Enzo going to expect is the valuations question. We are not
1:13:41
going to debate here today. Let me give you a thumb rule as entrepreneurs. Three
1:13:45
times. If a business can raise money from debt at 7%.
1:13:51
It the same business at the same point in time can raise the money from equity
1:13:54
roughly at 20. 7A is 21 roughly 20. It's a ballpark. It will vary country to
1:14:00
country. It will vary month to month macroeconomic situation wise. But
1:14:05
generally we need some ballparks right you know we need some thumb rules to
1:14:08
begin with three times. Can I therefore summarize this Myra versus Enzo debate?
1:14:15
Myra is a source of fund which is very inexpensive
1:14:19
but it is very rigid, very inflexible. I need to honor $3.5 anyhow every quarter
1:14:28
but it is very inexpensive good source. Enzo on the other hand is superbly
1:14:34
flexible. He cannot file a case against me in case
1:14:38
I don't pay the money, in case I don't pay any periodic returns. But he has an
1:14:42
expectation that I will pay 20% to him. He's taking so much risk after all. So
1:14:47
think about it. The next time I enter the room, there is a Myra and an Enzo.
1:14:53
On what basis should I decide? Should I raise money from debt or equity? Case
1:14:59
number one. Should this business raise money from debt or should this business
1:15:03
raise money from equity? Equity. Should this business raise money from
1:15:14
debt? No.
1:15:16
Or equity? Equity.
1:15:18
Why not debt? Everybody. Yeah. Go ahead.
1:15:22
All right. Because it's a like during certain seasons.
1:15:25
Very good. So, so they won't be able to pay quarterly.
1:15:29
Fantastic. Imagine 6 months I will be out of business and every 3 months Myra
1:15:33
is going to knock at the door and say where is my $3.5 if I don't generate
1:15:37
anything from the yellow box. How can I pay anything to the blue box? People are
1:15:41
you with me on that? I am as a business not producing money.
1:15:44
I'm not a central bank who can print the currency. I will generate from my yellow
1:15:48
box and we'll pay to the blue box. In between try and keep something for
1:15:53
myself. In this case 6 months I am out of work.
1:15:57
I can't you know make a commitment to my in that case. Therefore by choice I have
1:16:02
to by compulsion I have to go to equity. Second
1:16:07
another company walks in there is a debt and an equity both ready to give the
1:16:10
money. Whom should this company raise the money for?
1:16:13
Not equity because he wants to
1:16:16
because you see the existing owners have already said that you know I don't want
1:16:19
any further interference. The moment I raise equity you have to give some kind
1:16:23
of a uh you know shares to them. So somebody use the word equity and shares.
1:16:28
Can I say a kilometer to a distance? What isation kilometer versus a
1:16:33
distance? What does kilometer help do?
1:16:37
Measure. That's the relationship between shares and ownership.
1:16:42
The shares help us quantify this the amount of ownership. A slice to a pizza,
1:16:50
you know, it's a it's a 8 in pizza. It's a six slice pizza. So on so forth. So
1:16:53
that's the measure of it. So number of shares is like a you know common
1:16:56
denominator that way. Here clearly the answer is
1:17:00
debt. Okay. Third third business walks in.
1:17:07
There is a debt and equity both ready to give the money. Whom should this
1:17:10
business raise the money from? So what is the you see profitability is
1:17:20
what I do in my yellow box. The returns from the yellow box have two
1:17:28
characteristics. Number one, they are consistent. Every
1:17:32
month, every quarter, I generate something. Good news, but bad news is
1:17:37
not high. Which source of funding do you think
1:17:43
this business? Your answer is not important. The logic
1:17:51
which drives you to those answers are important.
1:17:55
This business should raise money as debt or equity. You have seen the pattern of
1:17:58
the profitability. It is consistent but it is very low.
1:18:05
With debt you're not going to be able to pay the interest.
1:18:08
So think about it. Uh what does what does Myra needs? Myra needs regular
1:18:14
payment $3.5 a quarter. And that's not a very high payment. Can this bank honor
1:18:20
Myra's commitment? Is this bank generating regular cash flows? Yes. And
1:18:24
even if they're not generating too high anyway, she's not asking for too high.
1:18:29
Therefore, debt is possible. Let's speak to Enzo. Equity guy. Equity. Uh, do you
1:18:35
need every quarter return? Not really. Equity is flexible. But
1:18:40
anyway, we have something extra here. We can't give you extra. But Enzo wants
1:18:45
20%. He's not going to be happy with 7%. Is
1:18:50
the bank going to generate 20% from the yellow box? No.
1:18:55
Where does what does the bank do with the money that they have raised? They
1:18:59
will give loans. What kind of loans will they give? Name some loans given by
1:19:04
banks. Mortgages.
1:19:04
Mortgages. What's the rate of interest in mortgages?
1:19:08
Three. Three, five, maybe in the US. Here it
1:19:11
will go a little higher. Emerging markets even higher. But not more than
1:19:14
10. Not more. and mortgages are the chunkiest loans which means the yellow
1:19:20
box return for Qatar National Bank is itself just 10. How can a 10% earning
1:19:26
person give 20 to Enzo but a 10% earning can give 7% to Myra?
1:19:33
You see how the choice between debt to equity has to look at according to the
1:19:37
sustainability of the profitability that I itself will make are we together?
1:19:42
Nextity. Equity or debt?
1:19:53
I'm going to write both. You have to tell me the reason why. Yes. Why? No.
1:19:57
Can this fellow raise debt? Can they raise debt?
1:20:04
No. No. Why? No.
1:20:09
Very good. If I myself am not sure about the returns, how can I promise anything
1:20:13
to Myra? Okay. And therefore debt has been ruled
1:20:17
out. Equity. Can this person raise money from
1:20:21
equity? What's the deal with Enzo? Enzo, I don't
1:20:24
promise how much will I pay. But whatever I make, it belongs to you. And
1:20:28
by looking at my exciting project, you can you have a probability of turning a
1:20:32
$1 into $1,000. It's that kind of a risk-taking project. In case Enzo as an
1:20:37
equity provider has that kind of risk, he can very well give the money.
1:20:43
Just to see if I universal like I thought that is when you take money from
1:20:48
someone and equity is the money that you make but someone can give you equity.
1:20:52
No no no no no in both cases a business was coming money was being raised from
1:20:57
Myra and Enzo in both both of them are part of the blue box both of them will
1:21:02
generate some cash inflow for me which I can deploy in the yellow box which I
1:21:07
can. So this marker needs $5, right? This $5 money can funding can come from
1:21:11
debt as well as from equity. Both of them are external fundings that you're
1:21:15
raising. Okay. Last Mitsubishi
1:21:23
a Japanese company. This is not strategic. This is tactical.
1:21:29
You always wanted to do something but you see sometimes you when you're out in
1:21:33
the market, you find something at like dirt cheap price. You end up buying more
1:21:36
of it. you happen to go to a car for 4 or or a metro or or you know a Dubai
1:21:40
mall you see a 50% sale in order to buy one t-shirt you are lured and you end up
1:21:45
buying two that's exactly what is the situation with you know the developed
1:21:49
markets here the developed market like America's
1:21:52
Europe Japan have rate of interest which are like asmtotically close to zero
1:21:57
Japan is a classic case why else people should not buy you know borrow then 1%
1:22:05
interest you know means But you utilize somebody's money for full year 365 days
1:22:11
and you just end up paying an extra one. It is dirt cheap. It is actually an
1:22:17
insult to the lenders. You know it is so low. So therefore this
1:22:22
is actually the situation for Japan where debt to GDP ratio in economics you
1:22:26
would do these parameters. Debt to GDP ratio is one of the highest. But the
1:22:30
logic is why would not it be? The debt is available so so cheap. Are we
1:22:35
together on that? Okay everybody, so we pause here and you guys were absolutely
1:22:39
terrific. I had a very very peaceful and a very productive class. I must thank
1:22:43
all of you. Thank you very much. Melanie.

What are the different legal forms that can be adopted to explore a business idea?
16/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha

0:10
I was in an internship yesterday. Everybody what are the two main
0:23
frameworks that we learned yesterday? The second one was debt versus equity.
0:27
Okay. The first one was Elon Musk six steps.
0:33
So the sixst step framework was very critical to understand and decompose
0:38
business into six different functions. First function was to raise money. Blue
0:43
box. Second invest that money which color
0:47
yellow box. Fantastic. Now the shop is step what? Who walks into my store now?
0:52
Customer. Step C. C for customer. Step D some expenses I'll have to incur. Hiring
0:58
employees. hiring consultants, paying rents, etc. C minus D is your profit
1:04
and the profits can be either reinvested or it can be given back to the the blue
1:09
box. Okay. So, we have Krishna, we have Ang
1:13
and Stella. You should
1:54
know. all logged in. Okay. So, we have a
2:04
smiling lobster as well. What would a 68
2:09
mean? I'm not so automatically correct.
2:16
Oh. Everyone loved it.
2:31
People don't take pressure, but please be logical. We want this group to
2:35
perform the best. Okay, I'll tell you so far how the how the other two sections
2:39
are. The morning section was like okay. Okay, they were not bad, but they were
2:43
okay. Okay, the immediately preceding section was pretty good. But my hopes
2:49
with all of you is the best considering your feedback yesterday. You know, the
2:53
way you performed, the things that we could achieve together. So, or maybe
2:57
it's just the good room that you guys have got.
3:01
Are you all ready? How many people have not been able to log in?
3:06
Everybody's in. All right. Ungraded. No cheatings, please. What's
3:13
the point? It's a self-reflection thing. A, B, C, or D. Hiring an employee. 5
3:39
seconds. Come on. Get it right. Get it right. Get it right.
3:46
Very good. Very good. I I was I was sure that you're going to perform better than
3:51
others. Um so this is the tallest tower. Good idea. But I'm a little surprised.
3:56
See at step C, we will think about it. Customer walks in. C stands for
4:00
customers. C stands for you know the letter C. Of course, bad idea. Um what
4:05
is the key activity that the business is doing here?
4:08
Hiring an employee. Is employee the customer? No. The employee is part of
4:13
your costs. You have to pay salary to that employee. Therefore, that's D for
4:17
Delhi. Are we together? Where do you see this activity being
4:23
done? This question talks.
4:29
I am maybe a consultant but yeah pseudo employee but it just talks about Jonah.
4:34
So Jonah for Teta is a cost. Obviously she will render the services etc. But
4:40
you are at step C. Me and Jonah are at step D and M is step D. D for Delhi. Are
4:48
we together? That's called as collectively called as cost expenses. C
4:52
is your incomes. You give income to TA. All right. Let's see next.
5:07
Okay. Let's see. Identify the transaction first.
5:16
And so that was very quick. Very good. I told you this group is
5:36
doing is going to kill it. Um step C again step C everybody you guys
5:44
are business persons you are entrepreneurs. How can you ignore your
5:47
customers? Step C is reserved for customers and incomes. Buying an office
5:53
printer is not your income. Are you with me on that? Selling an
5:58
office printer is an income for the shop from where you bought it. Okay. This is
6:04
you are spending the money. This is your yellow box. This is step B for Bombay.
6:09
Okay. All right. But nonetheless, the correct uh towers are the highest in
6:14
this room so far. So uh this is the third section and they have done the
6:18
best till now. But let's see. that.
6:43
Oh no.
6:54
And again the correct tower is the tallest. But step E. Now people now this
7:01
is exactly why we had put in this question. What is the difference between
7:05
E and F? Think from a business person's point of view. In step E, the business
7:10
is buying something again. That means the money remains in the business. It
7:16
doesn't go out of the business. In step F, the business actually pays back to
7:22
the original investors. That means the size of the business becomes smaller and
7:27
business pays out something to those investors either a debt or an equity or
7:31
whomsoever. Okay, that means step E for elephant will make sure that the size of
7:37
the business remains where it is. Business is just buying more assets.
7:41
Here the business is actually not buying an asset. Business is repaying the loan.
7:46
So therefore the cash from the business is going to go out. Business becomes
7:49
smaller. This is clearly step F. Are we together?
7:54
Okay. Read these options carefully. Only
8:21
neither. Either. Read these options carefully.
8:27
This is a trick question. little cash flows coming.
8:44
Correct. But you see the cash flow the cash flows this time are uncertain.
8:48
Ah so you have high you have low. Correct. So in that case I can't raise
8:52
money from debt because during the times of low cash flows I will not be able to
8:55
honor the payment. Whenever there is volatility avoid debt.
9:01
So the difference was that equity is also like it's interest.
9:06
So equity is flexible. Equity doesn't want fixed amount every month, every
9:10
quarter, every 6 months. So they're like uh I I can pay you more today. Will that
9:14
be okay? You can.
9:16
Correct. That's it. Flexible form of funding. Brilliant. Okay everybody. So
9:21
you're maintaining your record that the correct tower is the tallest. But the
9:25
next question is really tricky. It is not accounting and finance. It's more on
9:29
the cognitive abilities. Let's see if you can get this one right. Don't read
9:33
the question well. Just read the options also carefully. Question number five.
9:47
Read either neither. people. This is logical reasoning. This
10:05
is not accounting and finance. Come on.
10:10
Very good. So, one record you guys were able to maintain that always the correct
10:15
uh option was the highest tower uh and full I mean not full but yeah almost
10:22
full marks to people who answered only debt. They read the concept well.
10:26
Whenever the cash flows are consistent, you should raise debt. But what they
10:30
missed analytically is what is the question saying about the quantum of
10:35
cash flows? Is the quantum of the cash flow high or low? Read the question
10:39
again. It it just says about the consistency.
10:43
Does it say anything about how much? No. That means you can't rule out equity
10:47
either. You can rule out equity only when the
10:52
amount of profits are low. So that it will not suffice to pay equity which
10:57
will charge huge amount. So remember yesterday the fundamental was debt was a
11:01
fixed rate of cost but I have to pay it every time but it was very low. It's a
11:08
cheap source of funding but it is a very rigid source of funding. They don't
11:12
understand if I make losses I'll have to pay them nonetheless. Equity on the
11:16
other hand is a flexible source of funding. They understand. They say
11:20
whenever the business can pay they pay but when you pay pay more because that's
11:24
the flexibility that we are giving. So simple rates that we with the 7% is a
11:29
cost of debt 20% is cost for equity 7% is fixed thing in my life 20% is
11:34
flexible cost in my life. Nonetheless 20 is I have to pay someday. So the
11:39
question does not say anything about the quantum of the profit. So I can't rule
11:42
out equity in this case. That's why answer is either debt or equity.
11:48
Those who answered this also got the concept right. Maybe a little bit of
11:53
pick was there. But let's see who is the overall winner.
12:00
Who is the overall winner? Okay. Who comes on the podium?
12:09
K. Where is K? Good job. K. Very good.
12:13
Anzel. Where is Anzel? Good job and Krishna.
12:21
Whoa. So this is what we get in case we win
12:25
this. Okay. This is this is not an Oscar in any case. You want like a trophy for
12:30
every cohort. Okay. That brings us to our second
12:41
session. Yeah. I've used it.
12:52
Thank you everybody. I want to begin today with a simple question. I know
12:58
it's me who is standing between you and your lunch. Now I think yesterday also
13:01
was the same thing. Why have they put me always that you
13:06
have to look at me with so much hate? I know you are hungry so you don't have to
13:09
make faces unnecessarily. I understand. Um, how much is 2 plus two?
13:15
Come on. I wouldn't have wasted your time if it was that simple an answer.
13:20
Mhm. How creatively can you answer 2 + 2?
13:23
22. 22. Okay. People think of synergy. They
13:27
say that 2+ 2 is like a four. What else can a 2+ 2 be?
13:34
2+ 2 could be five. Okay.
13:41
Well actually the answer depends on who you are. You know there's an adage which
13:45
says you stand where you sit. So your perspective matters.
13:50
Logician says the problem is solvable. Physicist says the magnitude of so on so
13:54
forth. Uh I love social worker. I don't know the answer but I'm glad that we are
13:59
discussing this problem. Okay. But you see my favorite is the accountants.
14:06
How much is 2+ 2? What would you like it to be? I can make
14:11
it that much. People welcome to an course which is not ruledriven.
14:18
This is what the application. It's an art to do accounting. It's not a
14:22
science. I'll have some rules that you know there is an income, there is an
14:26
expense. But how should I read something and income? Will it be same for Oracle
14:31
versus let's say Yahoo all the time? No. Oracle might look at it differently.
14:35
Yahoo might look at it differently. So you here are not coming to learn the
14:39
templates. You are coming here to learn the logics. You apply the logics out in
14:43
the world. Whatever you think is right, you can do that. It's your Maggie. You
14:46
make it the way you want it to be. It's 2 plus 2 is how much? What you want it
14:50
to be. I'm not saying do fraudulent accounting. I'm not saying be
14:54
manipulative. But I'm saying be you. Be unique. Okay. All right. And I will
14:59
explain. I will bore you to death by always asking how much is 2 plus 2? So
15:03
what your answer has to be from tomorrow? What would you like it to be?
15:06
You're not into a rule-driven thing that I will always have a laundry list of
15:10
rules. Obviously, no. Okay. So, yesterday we stressed a lot upon
15:15
understanding business. We said that if you understand business, accounting will
15:19
be a cakewalk. I want to give you a business transaction and let's see how
15:22
good are you on understanding. I want to know how observant you are.
16:15
Yeah. Can we please mute these notifications? Laptops, phones, tabs.
16:20
Let me check mine as well. 20 more seconds.
16:29
People, you can't be a good accountant unless you read the business well.
16:50
None. Okay. Question. Who is doing what in the
16:55
transaction? Incorrect.
17:01
Don't feel bad. Unless I say incorrect. It's only to kind of correct and make
17:04
you better. Yeah. But so far incorrect. So
17:07
propose giving you 40% equity. Incorrect.
17:13
Incorrect. Investment in Coca-Cola.
17:16
Sorry. Sorry. One more time. Investment in Coca-Cola.
17:19
Incorrect. You you you just spoke. Yes.
17:25
Beverages is acquiring 40% equity. Very good. Very good. Okay. Say more
17:31
about it. Who is doing what? Who is the buyer?
17:37
Party group. No jubilant group. No jubilant beverages.
17:42
Very good. The buyer is jubilant
17:49
beverage limited.
17:53
What is the difference between jubilant beverage limited versus jubilant bhartya
17:57
group? Bhartya group jubilant family. It's the actual legal entity out in the
18:04
world who can make a transaction. people when Tetar gave you admission.
18:09
Oh, such a wrong English. Tetar can't give you admission. Tetar is a brand.
18:14
iPhones can't hire anybody. Model S of Tesla can't have a sale. It's always the
18:19
legal entities which are out in the field to do the transactions. My
18:24
engagement letter had a Tetar logo in it. But Tetar did not sign it. It was
18:29
signed by some PM MU. You know, that's the name of the legal entity and the CEO
18:34
of that. Tet is just a brand for example. Jubilant is just a brand. It's
18:38
just a family name. They don't do any business. For doing business, you need
18:42
legal entities. Good answer. Jubilant Beverage Limited. Who is the seller?
18:49
Incorrect. Incorrect.
18:55
H. Incorrect.
19:00
Who is the seller? Let me ask another question and then it will become clear.
19:04
What is being bought and sold? What is being bought and sold?
19:14
40% equity.
19:16
Equity is being bought
19:19
of no.
19:23
What is being bought and sold? Equity. Very good. 40%. Very good. Of
19:29
which company? HCC.
19:32
Very good. H C C H Okay. When I buy chair, is chair the
19:42
seller? No.
19:44
My question to you was who is the seller?
19:47
HCCB. HCCB. Incorrect.
19:50
FCC. Incorrect. HCC is the company which is
19:54
being sold. When I buy chair, I don't pay to chair. I pay four chair. You see
20:02
the difference? Paying to tatter
20:07
paying for fees. These are two different things.
20:12
Very good. When I buy the chair, whom do I pay to?
20:17
The owner of the chair, right? So the question is I am buying 40% equity of
20:21
FCC. The question is who has been holding it so far? I have to go to that
20:25
person. Then I have to buy the chair. I don't go to the chair. I go to the owner
20:29
of the chair and say, "Hey, you have one thing that I want. Here is my money.
20:33
Here is I'm taking the chair." That's what so the buyer will have to go to not
20:37
HCC but to somebody else. HCC.
20:41
HCCB. Now think about what is the relationship between FCC and HCCB.
20:45
FCC is a parent company. HCC
20:49
owns HCCB, not the other way around. Parents own children, right?
20:58
So the HCC the holding company is what I am buying. Automatically the entire clan
21:04
will come indirectly. So therefore it's incorrect to write
21:08
HCCB's name here because HCCB is not being contacted by JBL.
21:13
You have to go to the parent of HCC. Quickly Google who is the parent of
21:20
HCC. Just write Hindustan Coca-Cola because
21:23
there's another company in France somewhere with the name HCC.
21:27
So, so they're owning all of FCC, correct? So far, yeah.
21:37
Who is the parent company of Hindustan Coca-Cola Holdings?
21:41
Coca-Cola. Very good.
21:45
Situated in. Where is the Coca-Cola Company situated
21:49
in US?
21:52
US. So, the seller is in US. The buyer is in
21:57
another country. How much is the transaction value?
22:02
10,000 cr. 10,000 crores which is 1.2 let's say
22:06
billion dollars. Are we together
22:11
people? This is how you start looking at a business transaction because what is
22:16
accounting? Accounting means looking at a particular particular
22:20
business. So you can't say can you do the accounting for this? I can do
22:25
accounting for this entity. I can do accounting for this entity, this entity,
22:29
that entity. But I can't do a joint common accounting for everybody.
22:33
Everybody has to manage their own kitchen. Right? So
22:38
yesterday we spoke about business being a trade, give and take.
22:43
And we said a business is profitable when what we give is less than what no
22:51
wrong actions. A business is profitable when what we give is less than what we
22:57
get. We must get more, right? What is this entity letting go?
23:07
40% of equity of HCC. What is this entity getting?
23:14
10,000 10,000 cr $1.2 billion. What this TCC
23:18
must be thinking? When will TCC get into a transaction like that? When they think
23:24
the 40% of FCC is not as worth as $1.2 billion. 1.2 billion is what they are
23:30
receiving is more than the 40% of one of the companies that how many people have
23:36
ever uh bought shares and stocks and bonds ever any stocks and bond anything.
23:42
Um so let's say um which company did you sell or buy? Uh, Nvidia.
23:49
Nvidia. Okay. What happened when you sold Nvidia?
23:54
What do you mean? I mean, let's say one share you sold for
23:56
Nvidia. Okay. What transaction really happened? What did you give? What did
24:00
you get? Uh, I sold my shares and someone bought
24:03
them. Very good. And
24:06
did they not give you anything? Well, they gave money.
24:08
They give the money. That's exactly. So, you are here right now. You are selling
24:12
the shares that you own so far. Now, you will no longer be the owner. Somebody
24:15
else will be. and that somebody else has given you the cash. That's what it is.
24:19
Okay. What is give and take for Jubilant Beverage Limited?
24:25
What are they paying? $10,000.
24:28
$1.2 billion. And what are they getting?
24:31
40%. 40% of HCC control. When will the buyer
24:38
get into a transaction like that? Give and take. When they think that 40% of
24:42
this equity is worth more than 1.2 2 billion. People think about it. The
24:48
chair seller who let's say the price of this is
24:52
100 dhams. The chair seller is happy to sell it for 100 dirham because the
24:58
seller thinks this is not as much worth. 100 dirhams are better. So he would be
25:04
happy in the market to take 100 dirhams and give away the chair. But the chair
25:08
buyer thinks exactly opposite. He thinks that $100 or 100 dirhams are not as
25:13
worth as uh this chair. Trade always happens when between people who think
25:19
opposite. If both the people imagine, what's your good name?
25:23
Brendon. Brendan. Brendan and I both go in the
25:26
market thinking Nvidia is a good company. Both of us will come back
25:29
empty-handed. One has to think it's a good company, the other has to think
25:32
it's a bad company. Only then the bad company thinker will sell, the good
25:36
company thinker will buy, and that's why the trade will happen. Are we together
25:39
on that? All right. Okay. What is the buy and sell for HCC?
25:49
What did HCC receive? What did HCCF pay out? That's what I'll have to account
25:54
for. Accounting means recording a business transaction. For that, I need
25:57
to know what the business transaction is. What is the business transaction?
26:03
What is HCC receiving? Oh, you thought I thought you said TCC
26:10
is receiving 1.2. How can two companies receive the same amount? My question is
26:15
HCC, what are they receiving? 40%.
26:26
Nothing. When I buy this chair, who becomes rich?
26:31
Who receives my money? The chair or the chair seller?
26:34
The chair never becomes rich. Chair is a commodity which just have now a new
26:39
owner. They don't receive anything. So in the books of CCH maybe a new owner
26:44
will come in. TCC's name will get cancelled out and a new owner jubilant
26:49
beverage will come in. They don't receive anything. They don't pay
26:52
anything. So this transaction will not be recorded in the books of HCC because
26:56
they didn't do anything about it. And what does HCCB receive or pay?
27:04
Nothing again nothing.
27:08
Accounting does not mean to involve everybody whose name has been taken.
27:11
Accounting means you have to very categorically zoom into the transaction
27:16
and figure out who is doing what. Once now you know everybody if how would
27:21
you do accounting for TCC? It's very simple. Now you know what are they
27:25
receiving, what are they paying. So their bank balance I will increase by
27:28
1.2 to and there the balance of investment I will reduce by 40% of ETS
27:33
that's it accounting complete over so tell me which was more difficult to
27:37
analyze a business transaction or do the accounting
27:41
accounting is never difficult it is always a business transaction which is
27:45
more complicated for an entrepreneur like you you have to channelize your
27:50
energy into understanding what businesses are you understand it do a
27:54
transaction like this who does what pays whom to what then accounting is simple
27:58
Well, you know, anybody look at jubilant beverage. How would I do the accounting?
28:02
I will reduce their bank balance by 1.2 because they're paying out. And in their
28:07
demand accounts, their share account, I will increase 40%. FCC at accounting
28:10
complete. Nothing more, nothing less. Accounting is so simple. Whatever you
28:16
receive goes up in value. Whatever you give out reduces in value. That's it.
28:21
It's board mass. Simple addition, subtraction. Are we together on that?
28:25
Okay. Uh there was a question.
28:28
Yes. So you said HCC is like subset of HCC
28:33
and it's being sold. Yeah.
28:35
So we can write 40% of it to HCC is going out because
28:42
now owns HCC. No no think about it.
28:48
Whosoever owns HCC indirectly gets control of HCCB also.
28:56
Earlier FCC was controlled by TCC. So therefore FCCB also has a grandparent
29:04
in form of TCC. TCC never had put in money in FCCB. They
29:11
had put in money in the child. The child has a grandchild.
29:15
There is no direct link between these two. Now what happened in this
29:19
transaction is this child now has a different parent.
29:26
Which means this grandchild will have a different
29:31
grandparent. That's it.
29:36
Think about it. That's how you structure your business. Think about it. For Dubai
29:41
operation, there is a separate legal entity that Masters Union has opened up.
29:46
your fees is not going into the same account according to your let's say the
29:52
uh there are a lot of programs in Delhi that they run in Gura their entity is
29:56
different your entity is different when you guys go to Singapore it's a new
30:01
entity every entity needs to be done and that's exactly what is our topic of
30:08
discussion legal forms of doing business people doing business
30:14
whenever an entrepreneur comes up shares their journey etc. They are so much on
30:18
the product side that you forget that there has to be a legal entity that I
30:22
have to open. The legal entity is what we discussed here. Legal entity number
30:26
one, two, three, four.
30:32
So many legal entities are involved into this whole thing. Okay, I am sure that
30:37
the non-commerce have already gone through the some of these slides in the
30:43
video. So I want to cut to chase four basic forms of doing business.
30:54
Yesterday we were talking about which example $300 billion
30:58
oracle. Oracle and
30:59
open open. Can you figure out what is the
31:01
legal form of Oracle out of these four? Oracle is what?
31:10
Let's figure out let's figure out. Go to Google.
31:13
It's a public or is here
31:20
wasn't it a sole proprietorship for like its entire duration up until very very
31:24
recently. Which one?
31:26
It was Oracle was singly owned by one person.
31:28
No, no, no. Their majority shares may be held with one person. It's like a normal
31:34
investor like you know Elon Musk would hold um majority in Tesla Motors but
31:39
even the Norwegians over in wealth fund will hold a 1% in Tesla Motors. It's
31:43
these are all public corporations while the promoter continues to hold the
31:46
maximum it's public is also involved. Okay. And
31:50
what is open AI's legal form? Very good. You see both of them are
31:56
involved in a transaction huge value but their legal forms are different. Happily
32:00
no problem. Are we together on that? Okay, let's understand quickly. What is
32:05
a sole proprietor? One person putting all his money going
32:11
to office daily going managing his whole thing. Okay. And this person has not
32:15
been registered under the portal of the government as recognized form of doing
32:20
business. Recognized form of doing business does not mean uh illegal or
32:25
whatever. What I'm trying to get to is have you utilized uh these drivers uh
32:30
let's say from here to the airport or from wherever or Kharim, Uber etc. Those
32:35
taxis are not always owned by the companies. They're sometimes owned by
32:39
the drivers. So the driver with the taxi gets impanled with Uber or Karim and
32:45
then there is a commission model. Focus on the driver who has put in the money
32:50
to buy the car driver. driver does has the driver told the government about the
32:56
head office the source of funding does the driver report its quarterly earnings
33:01
no the driver is actually behaving like a sole proprietor
33:06
I'm not saying driver is doing anything illegal I'm not saying driver is
33:10
avoiding taxes nothing at all sle proprietors are simply those equity
33:15
investors where there's only one person investing that's it partnerships what is
33:22
What is partnership form? Two people coming together still not registered
33:26
with the government. So imagine driver and his brother both contributed half of
33:34
money. They bought a car and now the car is added to Uber or Kharim. This
33:40
business now becomes a partnership form because there are two people who are
33:43
contributing money but still it is not registered under the portal of the
33:46
government. meaning they don't have to tell anything about their financials and
33:49
anything to the government and government also is okay with that. You
33:52
know why government has a span you know management span government say I can't
33:56
handle every Tom Dig and Harry who is doing something I want to handle only
33:59
big businesses again the paral rule you manage you know 20% who accounts for
34:04
80%. So I'm not interested really to look at everyone who is doing business.
34:08
Yes, I will collect taxes and all of that. That's what government is saying.
34:10
But I don't care whether the taxi vala is making money not money etc etc.
34:15
That's your sole proprietor and partnership. Welcome to formal ways of
34:19
doing business. The risk in the first second I'm going to just write one and
34:24
two 1 2 3 and four. Imagine the driver meets with an
34:29
accident. Okay. A person gets killed. Hypothetically there is a huge civil law
34:34
you know a case in the court the court rules out that driver was drunk and
34:38
there was a huge liability let us say um 5 million dirhams the driver has to pay
34:45
to the family of this driver is such a small business his
34:50
entire business capital is so small that it will fall short of the amount that he
34:55
has to pay the courts can sell his personal house personal jewelry personal
35:01
wealth in order to honor some kind of a business loss. Which means the driver's
35:06
personal life is exposed to the business losses should they happen. That's the
35:11
problem in one and two. What is the advantage in one and two? They're very
35:15
simple to operate. You don't have to report to the government. You don't have
35:18
to hire a charted accountant or a CPA to file your you know unnecessary returns.
35:23
So when do you do one and two? When you are not sure about the business when
35:27
you're just testing the waters. When you are like I don't know whether I will do
35:30
it. Why I spend so much money on legal cost etc. Then you do one and two. But
35:34
the moment you think now I have to do something serious in life I can open AI.
35:39
Open AI is at three. Most businesses in the world you see are at three. Three is
35:45
like a sweet spot. It is not as much under public scrutiny as public
35:49
corporations but it has still given you the protection to the investors. So I'll
35:54
give you an example of why one and two went out of favor very quickly. There
35:58
was a consultant. Typically consulting firms are group of intelligent people.
36:02
They were giving some advice to a telecom company. The telecom company I
36:06
think it was a French case. They gave some idea to them that you know telecom
36:11
does not have so much demand. You should not invest. But telecom in France then
36:15
kind of just went up 10 times over the next 3 years. So that firm missed out on
36:20
that growth opportunity because their consultants gave them a wrong idea. That
36:25
firm filed a case against the consultants and the court of law it was
36:29
proven that the consultant did not do adequate research and therefore
36:32
consultants have to give uh a lot of money to that firm who could not
36:37
capitalize on the telecom growth. The consultants were operating as
36:41
partnership firm. The consulting business anyway had very little capital
36:45
invested. Their house got sold, their cars got sold, their jewelry of the wife
36:49
got sold. And then all those businessmen thought that you know doing one and two
36:54
is very risky. We need some kind of a legal protection. Business may lost can
36:59
happen any point in time. But that doesn't mean that my house can be sold.
37:03
That's why three and four came in. So the moment you are registered with the
37:08
government, two things happen in your life. One good, one bad. Good thing is
37:12
that now the government says your liabilities are protected. Don't worry.
37:16
But the bad thing is government nothing gives you for free. Government says you
37:20
got to pay me some annual fees. You got to give me your annual performance
37:23
profits and balance sheets and all of it. You got to whenever you hire a CEO,
37:27
inform me. Whenever you do a merger acquisition, inform me. Whenever you
37:30
launch a new product, inform me. People like Elon Musk don't like interference.
37:35
So therefore, Tesla Motors have been here in 2017. He got fed up. Posted on
37:41
Twitter, I am taking Tesla private again. Enough of this you know SEC and
37:47
the US government intervention. So you don't have to rush to a particular legal
37:51
form is what I'm trying to say. You have to nicely decide which legal form will
37:56
suit your business the best match the following.
38:00
So what about taxes? Are they higher? No agnostic. Tax agnostic. All four of
38:07
them sle proprietor partnership limited and public. All four of them can take
38:11
loan from any bank. All four of them can hire any number of employees. Let's see
38:17
which of the photograph uh resonate with soul versus partnership versus whatever.
38:24
This photograph resonate the best with soul. This photograph with
38:28
partnership. Why not LLC?
38:32
Second photograph. Why not LLC? Could be because
38:36
could be. Could be. What about the third one?
38:41
LLC. Does this resonate the best with public?
38:44
Public. Well, all the answers are actually wrong.
38:50
What is the right answer? All of them could be anything.
38:53
Very good. Why? All of them could be anything. How do you know that this is
38:58
not a public corporation and this is just an employee? How do you know that?
39:01
How can you tell? How do you know by looking at them that their firm is
39:05
registered with the government or not? This could be LLC. This could be
39:07
partnership form for all we care. Meaning thereby by looking at any
39:11
business optically visually you can never tell the difference between these
39:17
is the backend blue box capital structure. How many people have given
39:21
money as equity and whether you registered with the government. If
39:25
somebody walks into this classroom what will they see? Students, trainer, an
39:30
employee and some infrastructure. Will they ever get to know whether this
39:35
money has been raised through equity or debt? Whether this firm is registered
39:39
with the government's portal or not. No. That means by looking at any business
39:42
you can never say these are all back end of the businesses. Are we together on
39:46
that? Okay. Case time. Four of you summer, autumn, winter and
39:53
spring want to do a particular business and very different businesses. Different
39:58
aspiration levels, different innuendos, idiosyncrasies. Oh, I want personal
40:04
control. No, I don't want personal that kind of a thing. I have large dream. I
40:07
don't have such large dreams. These are the four business options and four legal
40:14
forms. Sole, partnership, private and public. I want you to match the
40:20
following. But here is a trick. If you allocate sole proprietor to let us say
40:26
summer, you cannot allocate sle proprietor to anybody else.
40:31
One firm should be given to one business. That's it. Is the task clear?
40:36
It's a group exercise. You have 5 minutes. Speak to the person sitting
40:39
next to you and let's get the right answers.
40:45
Soul partnership. Um,
41:55
without any I like that.
42:27
Oh yeah.
42:35
Sorry. Limited companies. These are the friends and family affairs.
42:38
Friends and family affairs. Let's say you uh you you
42:43
and you all friends and family and we get ourselves registered with the
42:46
government. Our personal liabilities are protected. Now even if the business
42:51
incurs a loss only the money that we have contributed in the business can go
42:56
to but my personal watch personal jewelry all my family members takes is
43:01
going to be safe. Oh okay.
43:03
In partnership everything remains same except that this liability protection
43:08
goes off then suddenly if a business loss happens I can lose all my personal
43:13
wealth as well in the partnership. uh he doesn't want to franchise his mom.
43:21
So basically it doesn't matter if like he doesn't he doesn't raise his family
43:27
because he's not careful right
43:31
say again so he also wants to franchise you so he
43:37
doesn't want a lot of businesses right so I think this one
43:41
correct similar to that some similar to that yeah and different countries might
43:46
have another legal form to kind of create so these are all the regulatory
43:51
infrastructure of a particular country. What we have picked up because of the
43:54
hetrogenity here, we have picked up four forms which you see in every country
43:58
almost. That's what we have picked up. Yeah.
44:15
Nonranchise non franchisee. He wants to do it.
44:21
Correct. He's
44:45
always Last one minute everybody then let's get
45:19
going. Correct. Yeah.
45:47
Okay, the silence tells me that all of you are ready.
45:54
Summer, have you made up your mind for summer?
45:58
Summer should be given which form? Nobody for partnership.
46:16
You see, we have one less problem to worry about. Congratulations,
46:20
Autumn. Soul,
46:30
that's it. People don't shy away. Who knows? That's
46:35
the right number. That's the right answer. Nobody for partnership.
46:39
No. Okay.
46:42
Winter. That's the loudest.
46:48
Everybody think it's partnership. Nobody think it should be soul.
46:53
No. No. There are people who think that's
46:55
it. Why not? Nobody think it's should be LLC.
47:00
No. No. Here. Now, here's the point. I think we are playing a game practically
47:05
I'll tell you what will happen most of them will end up taking LLC
47:09
but that's not a practical scenario we are saying now I am tying you know
47:14
fencing you that you can't allocate LLC to more than one that means you have to
47:18
make a choice it's a suboptimal allocation by design
47:23
so in case LLC can't be given to all of them then you think would you still want
47:28
to give LLC to winter no that's the Spring
47:33
public public okay
47:36
LLC very good and
47:40
partnership you want to give partnership
47:43
even he's doing with his friends okay all right fair point
47:49
so you see that it's quite a divided house like a good management case there
47:53
is pros and con for each of these things and we might come up with a solution
47:59
which is which is not an idealist istic solution but maybe least debatable. Let
48:03
me use that word least debatable. Let's pick up winter. You're saying soul
48:10
versus partnership. The great performance of this batch is nobody
48:14
thought of his LLC and public. So that's well done. Think about it. Look at the
48:18
kind of business he's in. Do you think a sole proprietor will be able to do it
48:22
better or a partnership will be able to do it better?
48:25
Kind of business. He always wanted to be a team member. And the kind of business
48:29
is also event management. You see there are people from different walks of life,
48:32
different skill sets are required. So I think what is better is partnership.
48:41
Okay. Which means if partnership is given to
48:45
winter, spring can't have it because we are tied up with that you know one
48:49
allocation per business. Let's talk about the autumn.
48:57
What is the kind of business that autumn is in?
49:01
Manufacturing. Number one. Number two, exports. Number three, what is it?
49:06
Textiles, is it handiccraft? Or is it cement? Which means this fellow will
49:11
have to bomb a limestone rock using a dynamite. Transfer all that limestone on
49:17
a belt in the factory. break those, crush them, add gypsum, you know, have
49:22
the cement made, have the trucks take it to across the country distribution.
49:26
That's how cement distribution works. How much money do you think cement
49:29
distribution will need? Can one single person bring it? Maybe yes, you can
49:33
argue if it is Elon Musk, one person can do it. But in general, you see, one
49:37
single person will not have enough money to do all of that. It's a very heavy
49:43
investment. And there is something else written here
49:48
which guides you away from sole proprietor. Can you think about what is
49:52
that? Exports.
49:54
Exports. Why sole proprietor is a bad idea for exports?
49:57
Due to the legal consent, the registration with the government is
50:01
not there. People while you are here out of your different countries, what is the
50:05
most important document that you're carrying?
50:08
Passport. Why passport is more credible than your student ID issued by Teta?
50:15
recognize why passport is more authentic compared
50:18
to a student ID stand by government that is what means
50:24
registration with the government and answer my question does everybody in
50:28
every country has to get a passport no only when you travel abroad only when
50:32
you think that you need it that's exactly what I mean by being a sole
50:35
proprietor and partnership people who don't have passport don't they file tax
50:39
returns they do are they doing something illegal no that's what sole proprietor
50:43
and partnerships are they are not just registered with the government every
50:47
business that they're doing is okay so here because you have to go to some
50:52
other country you need a passport with you you need credibility on the on on
50:55
your you know identity therefore autumn can't be given the soul
51:00
look at summer what is this funding requirement large or small
51:06
large or very large very large the kind of business they are
51:10
in K12 means like school okay like from nursery mont
51:14
to the 12th grade. You see that kind of an investment today is so huge. You need
51:20
to spend so much on the piece of land first, then on the infrastructure, then
51:23
on technology so on and so forth. And this chap wants to do all of it himself.
51:29
The non-franchise model, I'm not going to give away the franchisee.
51:32
Non-franchisee means I want to do it all by myself. This chap needs the maximum.
51:37
Can a sole proprietor generate so much money? No.
51:42
Are we together? How are we logically coming at these things? Now between
51:46
summer and autumn, who needs more money? Because I'm left with these two
51:50
varieties public and LLC to be given to first two. Between these two, who needs
51:54
more money? Summer.
51:56
Summer. Therefore, only out of that only out of funding I am giving these
52:02
allocations. And poor spring. Nobody asked.
52:07
Welcome to the youngest sibling of the family.
52:10
Yes. Doesn't the spring need some protection from the government and being
52:14
a doctor he needs to buy a setup and equipment do that are expensive.
52:17
Very good point. Now this is exactly I've actually spoken my mind out. There
52:21
are a lot of points which for spring come out of sole proprietor the question
52:26
is hinting away from sole proprietor. What are those points where the question
52:30
is saying sole proprietor is not a good idea. But what would we do? We had to
52:33
allocate soul proprietor. But I'm just trying to say uh where does it say that
52:36
sle proprietor is not the idea for spring
52:41
he wants to do business with group of friends you see the is similar
52:47
to winter member that's exactly the same being a team member what is the
52:53
difference between these two teams I know I have a question
52:56
yeah go ahead go ahead uh so in summer I asked if like was okay
53:02
because Both LLC was okay and public corporation
53:06
was okay. In case of summer and autumn both but
53:10
between these two the funding requirement is higher. The money
53:14
requirement is higher by summer. Public corporations can allow you raise much
53:19
more money and therefore we had to you know push to the envelope. We have to
53:24
allocate it this way. So coming back to spring you see it says that you know I
53:28
want to um kind of work with my friends uh and then
53:33
you know is a valid point that you know medical liabilities are very high and
53:37
he's always be exposed to so forth so like I said practically he will actually
53:41
end up having an LLC only but because here we are ring fenced and we can't
53:46
allocate LLC to both therefore we had to you know kind of do it but yeah tell me
53:51
the only thing is like up to Now what I have seen schools
53:56
especially P schools can't go into public market
53:59
correct they are not yeah they are not
54:01
100% so why we are
54:04
100% so people here we are just trying to build a logic the logic is that
54:09
anybody who needs maximum capital it's only the public corporations can allow
54:13
you to do that in case you need to do a business which has let's say export
54:19
import implication these are the logics that you are taking home today after the
54:23
class in case you have to to import export business registration of the
54:26
government is critical. Sle proprietors and partnerships are to be avoided. I
54:30
completely buy your point. Generally, schools do not have public corporation
54:35
as the legal form. I'll tell you schools actually have neither the LLC's but the
54:40
trusts and we'll talk about the trust in a way but here we're trying to just
54:43
build logics because spring on the other hand is like a poor child. We didn't ask
54:49
him. We just kind of give that flavor form and the spring says no I wanted to
54:52
work with my friends. How do I do it? How the sle proprietor is only one
54:55
person etc. We said no no no spring think about it. You are a doctor right?
54:59
Your professional friends will also be doctors. They are not investors.
55:05
You can still be a sole proprietor. You put in your money and the other friends
55:08
can work with you on consultation on commissions on impal bands. So you don't
55:13
really have to take money from your professional friends to be able to do
55:16
that job. So spring finally kind of got a but yeah I completely agree this is a
55:20
weak allocation. But the problem was sole proprietor could not be given to
55:23
anybody else. No, that's the problem. And I still completely agree you know
55:27
your point uh what's your name? An ang that angad medical liabilities
55:32
are one of the largest and one of the deadliest. Therefore nursing homes
55:37
generally never have sole proprietorship. The consumer activism is
55:41
so high you know in food industry as well as in the medical industry uh that
55:46
they always end up having an LLC. So like most of the even the clinics you
55:53
can see clinic is different clinics are
55:55
different but let's say nursing homes medical setups operations etc is always
55:59
there okay everybody uh just just to kind of quickly um come back to this
56:04
point um um 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 how do you go from
56:12
four to three can you go from four to three
56:15
yes how
56:18
buying stocks what paid three to four having public in
56:22
the room. If you pay out public and ask them to go, then suddenly a public
56:27
corporation can become an LLC. Can an LLC become a partnership form?
56:33
Yes. What made a partnership form become an LLC?
56:37
Registration with the government. You go to the government and say, I want to
56:39
dregister. Can you surrender your passport?
56:43
Can you surrender your passport? Yes, you are dregistering yourself with the
56:46
government. Government says you won't be able to travel abroad. You said okay
56:49
okay that's okay. It depends upon your individual scenario and Microsoft has
56:54
done a good job. What is control zed as a shortcut?
56:58
Undo. Undo function. So whatever step pushed
57:02
you to the next you undo that and you will be back at the same thing. What
57:06
made a sole proprietor become into partnership?
57:10
Combining with more people you pay out their again the sole member. So
57:15
depending on the need of the corporate you can sometimes change the legal form
57:20
but here is my submission these changes are very few and far between these are
57:24
not like day-to-day things that you will hear
57:27
and very costly as well which is the biggest difference about
57:31
the LLC and publication good point in LLC and public corporation
57:37
you raise money only from friends and family
57:41
here you raise money from the name is public. Public means somebody you don't
57:47
know personally. The personal persuasion won't work. So when a company in Dubai
57:52
wanted to raise money from Burkshshire Hway, Warren Buffett, the promoter had
57:57
flown down to uh US had seven meetings in 7 months personal persuading an
58:06
investor making that investor my friend. That happens in LLC's
58:11
in public corporation nobody has time. Public is everywhere.
58:15
Do people think about it? Am I a public to you?
58:19
No. Not anymore. Before the course started,
58:22
yes. Public means somebody whom I don't know personally. Somebody the personal
58:26
persuasion won't work. Yes, ma'am. And um in the fight for example, there's
58:32
no but
58:35
uh that is also just for investors. I mean a group of people that are like
58:42
doctors and investors or just investors like in the case
58:46
just investors just and that to equity investors all four of them can raise
58:51
money from any number of banks. The only difference between a you know
58:55
all these forms are who is sitting in my blue box capital structure as equity
59:00
guy. That's it. That's the only difference between all four of them.
59:05
Okay everybody, let's come to a rather easy um can you just quickly read
59:11
through the last line everybody most educational
59:22
most um religious uh most of the education religions medicine these are
59:31
furtherance of societal cause. So governments of different countries
59:34
recognize that okay fine yeah I should not be taxing them you know I want more
59:38
money to go in so on so forth like temples mosques you know churches etc.
59:42
Most of the organizations that owns the churches and the mosques and the temples
59:48
are neither LLC's nor public nor soul nor private. They are actually trusts.
59:52
So trust is the fifth form of doing business which is more famous for not
59:56
for-profit organizations. But here is a catch. The government of those countries
1:00:00
says I will not collect income tax from you but in case you happen to make
1:00:05
profit please don't give it out to your investors as dividends. Which means
1:00:10
remember Elon Musk sixstep framework. What was the sixth step? Giving money
1:00:16
back to the shareholders. That step does not exist for trusts. The trust legally
1:00:23
whatever profits they make, they never pay tax to the government. The
1:00:26
government has a deal with them that okay fine I will not charge any tax from
1:00:29
you because you're doing something for the society. But then you also can't
1:00:32
give it back to your investors. So investing into trust is a one-way
1:00:36
street. You see m here it's owned by a trust.
1:00:41
You see an IMT. Okay. IMT has also has a building right you know somewhere here.
1:00:45
You see a bits pilani. They are all owned by a trust. So bits says Birla's
1:00:50
IT school something. Okay. The name is Birla but BLA is a brand. Birasa's trust
1:00:57
is owning that campus. So on and so forth. Even lovely professional
1:01:01
university which is the parent for master's union and mast's union is a
1:01:05
parent for teta LPU is owned by a trust so whatever profits that LPU makes the
1:01:12
promoter family cannot take it back as dividend so that's the deal with trust
1:01:17
so that's exactly choosing the right form of doing business is very very
1:01:20
critical and then you have personal trusts also where you know Mark
1:01:24
Zuckerberg will donate his wealth to a trust and the trust will give it to the
1:01:28
daughters That's where you save inherent in tax. But this is not a tax
1:01:32
discussion. So we are not bringing that out.
1:01:34
The trust have trust holders own like earn money or value.
1:01:41
So whatever trust has as a pool of money they invest into FDs, mutual fund,
1:01:45
shares etc. They generate money from there.
1:01:47
So eventually how withdraw
1:01:50
they can't withdraw. That's the point. How do they withdraw as
1:01:55
of course but then they have to work as an employee. It's not just as an
1:01:58
investor. Are we together everybody? Why would somebody get into a trust if
1:02:02
they're not very interested? That's the point. That's exactly the
1:02:05
point. If I'm feeling very very social, I'm feeling very philanthropic. I don't
1:02:10
want to get any benefit out of it. There will come a point in your life where you
1:02:13
think I want to do something for the society. That's the point you look at
1:02:17
the trust. Till the time you are I, me, myself, you will never think of trust.
1:02:23
Trust is very very socialist way of doing business. Okay everybody? Are we
1:02:27
ready for the last rapid fire? 5 minutes. I know. I know. We will be like
1:02:33
taking five more minutes, but here's the deal. Give and take. I take 5 minutes
1:02:38
extra today and I give you 10 minutes tomorrow.
1:02:43
How does that sound? I take 5 minutes extra and you get 10 minutes of leeway
1:02:48
tomorrow. How does that sound? Give or take. Business is give and take. What
1:02:54
you give 5 minutes of your time today, what you get 10 minutes of your time
1:02:58
tomorrow. Think about it. Is it a profitable deal?
1:03:03
Looks like we have a deal. Come on, Charing. Come on. It's a deal. Yeah,
1:03:06
we're losing another. We are losing what?
1:03:11
Another 5 minutes tomorrow. No, I will give you 10 minutes.
1:03:16
Seriously, you have to take me on the face value.
1:03:20
Let's quickly understand what is operating investing financing. There was
1:03:23
a pre-watch video for this as well. How many people could get a chance to watch
1:03:26
it? People, this is a question of sincerity which is absolutely free of
1:03:31
cost. Where are the non-commercees in the room?
1:03:34
Non-commerce students. Non-commerce who never looked at
1:03:39
commerce people those pre-watch videos are essential for all of you otherwise
1:03:45
there is always a perceived disadvantage that you will be at that oh my god I
1:03:50
don't know. Let's say I know less than others. Please look at those pre-watch
1:03:54
videos. Those are small videos. 7 minutes, 10 minutes. Okay. So, this is
1:03:58
like the second time we are meeting pre-watch video. There is one for
1:04:02
tomorrow. Please make sure you don't enter the room without watching it. This
1:04:06
is related to accounting. We don't want you to be at a lower pedestal. So, what
1:04:11
we're trying to do is 5 minutes. Every activity done by any business can
1:04:17
be divided into three components. three categories let me call it operating
1:04:22
activities day-to-day jobs investing activity related to my long-term assets
1:04:29
and financing activity related to my blue box equity and debt that's it
1:04:35
operating activity name of few dayto-day that on regular basis
1:04:40
travel of what transport
1:04:43
transport okay very good transporting students from one place to the other
1:04:47
hiring a faculty hiring an employee conducting these classes. These are
1:04:51
regular day-to-day activity. Name an activity where tractor is spending money
1:04:56
for long-term. A camera,
1:04:59
licenses, licenses, developing a website,
1:05:02
developing an LMS, setting up campuses,
1:05:04
setting up campuses, so on so forth. These are long-term activities. Welcome
1:05:07
to investing activities. Financing, Tet raising money from debt or equity. Tet
1:05:13
repaying money to debt or equity. Tet are giving some interest, dividend or
1:05:18
anything, anything to do with the blue boxes financing. Okay, I want you to
1:05:23
quickly look at this list.
1:05:27
Drop shipping. I kind of simplified the thing to you
1:05:31
people. I'm going to get you this PPT immediately. Did you get yesterday's PPT
1:05:36
uploaded on the LMS? It'll always be uploaded as post class. Okay. So after
1:05:42
today you are going to get and you will you will find this PPT also uploaded.
1:05:47
I want you to just think through an entrepreneur got a venture debt
1:05:54
funding. You have to think from a business
1:05:57
standpoint. What is business doing? Business is raising money from debt.
1:06:02
Debt is part of capital structure. That is
1:06:06
financing. That's how in your mind you have 2 minutes. Can you allocate O, I,
1:06:11
and F for all of these in your mind. Let's do it. 2 minutes you spend on
1:06:16
these nine. Just do O, I, and F. O for operating, I for investing, F for
1:06:24
financing. Have you all crossed till here?
1:07:06
Yes. Let's see if you're on the right track. The business decides to raise 100
1:07:11
more from the owner. Operating, investing or financing.
1:07:16
Very good. How much is the total funding raised?
1:07:21
600. 600. Maybe they thought that it is
1:07:24
short. They raised more for some purpose. What is this opex?
1:07:31
operational expenses like paying for salary, you know, doing something
1:07:35
regular, marketing, stuff like that. What is the opposite of OPEX? Capex.
1:07:41
Capex is long-term investments, setting up campuses. OPEX short-term,
1:07:46
day-to-day. Don't you think OPEX op stands for therefore the category is
1:07:52
operational? Capex may cap stands for capital long-term. That's the long-term
1:07:57
investment that you're making. But here is the business spending for opex or is
1:08:01
the business raising funds that financing funds for raise for any
1:08:05
purpose. But you are going to the blue box. Blue box is financing. That's it.
1:08:10
How much money do you have now? 500 plus 100 6 plus 80 680. Where did you start
1:08:16
spending? You spent on a website $60 which is life of 3 years. Is this capex
1:08:21
or opex? Capex long-term. Therefore
1:08:25
investing investing
1:08:28
you purchase an office printer for 300 longterm short-term
1:08:31
longterm printer generally used beyond a year one
1:08:36
investing but in addition to that you also have
1:08:42
amount being spent for day-to-day printing papers this bit is operating
1:08:48
it okay you developed the website but now
1:08:53
website had some bugs that's That's the regular thing you have to hire an IT
1:08:56
consultant to get. Is this operating or investing?
1:08:58
Operating. Very good. You guys are doing a good
1:09:01
job. Add campaigns on Facebooks. Dayto-day, regular, operational. This is
1:09:07
like not a long-term thing like buying a printer or something.
1:09:12
Received a sales order from a customer. Customers.
1:09:17
Operating day-to-day. That's the most operational activity. Your customers.
1:09:22
logistics provider picked up the goods from the supplier and delivered to the
1:09:25
customer. That's your basic business model, isn't it? Operational is
1:09:30
day-to-day business model. Come on, everybody. Rapid fire. Let's do it.
1:09:38
I still have 4 and 1/2 minutes. We had a deal, right?
1:09:42
We had a deal. I'll take 5 minutes and then give you
1:09:47
10. Okay. So, Abby, it's just 30 more seconds. Okay. Come on everybody.
1:09:52
Suppliers were paid 4,000 for the business. This is operating, investing
1:09:56
or financing. Operating
1:09:58
operational suppliers are day-to-day. Teter looks at me as an operational
1:10:03
expense. Teter looks at the camera as a long-term
1:10:07
expense. Tetar looks at this marker as
1:10:12
longterm or short-term. Short-term operational.
1:10:17
There was an institute who had everything digitized. They had
1:10:21
absolutely nothing use of this marker but nonetheless they purchased it. The
1:10:25
marker went for more than a year and their accountant said for me the marker
1:10:31
is long-term. How much is 2 plus 2? Whatever.
1:10:35
What would you want it to be? Can you sitting in tetar thinking this is
1:10:40
operational force somebody else to say no markers are always operational? No.
1:10:45
In that business, the marker was beyond a year. Therefore, they can call it a
1:10:49
long-term asset. Another business had some everything digitized. They use
1:10:53
clicker so many times. So many times that the clicker's normal life has is
1:10:57
roughly 3 months. We use it for 2 years. We call it long-term. They call clicker
1:11:03
short-term. Depends on businesses. You can't have a template in mind that
1:11:07
marker is always short-term. Clicker is always long-term. People 2 is 2 is how
1:11:11
much? 2 plus 2. what you would like it to be according to your context. You
1:11:15
paid a small fees to pay you bank. Is this operating or financing?
1:11:22
You are not taking a loan from this bank. It is just helping to collect
1:11:25
customer collection. Customers are always you know day-to-day
1:11:29
after one year she paid an interesting financing dealing with debt. Your the
1:11:35
business is giving gift payment back to the owner. Again, this is financing.
1:11:41
You're dealing with your stakeholders. Mutual funds were purchased using the
1:11:45
profits investment.
1:11:49
Reinvested profits worth so and so for integrating Gem Gemini.
1:11:54
Very good. You don't integrate every day. After integration, you maintain
1:11:58
every day. Sold the printer. This is a critical point.
1:12:05
When you bought the laptop for yourself, this is the last point actually. You
1:12:09
bought the laptop first. You said it's an investing activity. You are not a
1:12:12
laptop trader. Correct? Used it for 3 years and then sold it back. Have you
1:12:18
become a laptop trader now? No.
1:12:20
You remain a student. You remain an entrepreneur. That means long-term
1:12:23
assets when they are bought or sold remains an investing activity. Only when
1:12:28
they are used becomes an operating activity. How
1:12:32
frequently do you use your laptops? Dates. That's the point. So, can you
1:12:36
just scribble this important point? Tomorrow we might ask you in the cahoot
1:12:39
questions. Buying and selling. Just write it in ultrashort form. Buying and
1:12:44
selling. Buying and selling long-term assets.
1:12:53
Buying and selling long-term assets is investing
1:13:01
is investing. Whereas using long-term assets
1:13:10
using long-term assets is
1:13:16
operating investing or financing using how frequently do you use
1:13:22
operating that's the point. So when you buy investing when you sell investing
1:13:27
activity but when you use it operational activity
1:13:31
loan taken was repaid no marks for guessing it good everybody you guys were
1:13:37
absolutely fabulous your cahoot performance was better than the other
1:13:41
two that's one of the reflections and I wish
1:13:46
the non-commerce students please bring in sincerity to read the pre-watch video
1:13:52
tomorrow is the first time accounting is going to enter our lives. Okay, all the
1:13:57
best. I'll see you tomorrow.

How do the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement fit together to tell your business story?
17/09/2025 | 08:30 AM - 10:00 AM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:01
that the defines and it seems the real time access with
0:06
the people. So as the camera will work
0:11
well I mean you need to wear an entreprene
0:18
manufacturers who can build the app do the glasses
0:22
but I'm sure this is an idea which is already there in the market
0:26
but will not market no no it's already there in the market
0:29
today you have some uh products glasses
0:32
yeah the the Rayan as a company has launched it formally they call
0:36
for the general category public but as a very investor okay you investing in
0:41
Dubai you have to sit back in India limited time you can come to Dubai what
0:46
is you got an options to buy you one glasses and connect it with your app
0:51
that shows you the real time thing of the properties will you buy the glasses
0:55
no I will have to go to the plot and see what the status of the property is
1:00
because again it's like a somebody showing a very good marketing brochure
1:05
uh in just in an in an e format. I'm not going to
1:09
No, but it's a real time in real data. I would still like to go to the Come,
1:14
let's go. Okay, let's You're
1:58
still at stage of attendance. God, this is the
2:44
Take the speech.
3:04
Sorry. All right, everybody.
3:29
Good morning. Session three, quiz two. Let's see if we can get all of you to
3:36
get the right number. Hey,
3:59
hey, hey. Heat. Heat.
4:24
Hey, hey, hey.
4:59
All right. Operating, investing, financing,
5:14
raising money. Very good. Very good. I must say this is
5:27
much better than the first section. Good job. But here everybody, I'm sure that
5:33
I'm sure this must be out of a fat finger error. Okay? You know, giving
5:39
money to startups is operating for the VCE because that's their main job. But
5:45
for the startup raising money is not their main job. It remains a funding
5:49
activity. Are we together on that? So when you go to the bank and borrow some
5:53
money for the bank it's operational but for you it is not operational. You're
5:58
not that's not your day-to-day job to kind of go and raise money. So here it
6:01
is a funding activity. You're raising equity or debt by the way?
6:05
Equity. Equity. Equity. All right. Okay. Cool.
6:08
Uh next for Oracle buying a server.
6:38
Oh my god. Well, well, well.
6:44
Where are these two people who have marked financing? Come on. It can't be
6:47
financing. Financing. Financing is equity and debt.
6:52
Okay. Um, this is a close call. How many people believe it's operating?
6:58
Now, think about it everybody. What is operational?
7:02
Yeah, it's a long-term asset. They have to use the server every day. They don't
7:08
have to buy the server every day. Are we together on that?
7:12
But when we talk about the the remote yesterday for some companies, it may be
7:17
interesting because they use it like they have to buy one every two years.
7:20
Very good. I'm sure Oracle has to buy servers every
7:24
I don't know 6 months instead of Very good. So again, how much is 2 plus
7:28
two? What would you want it to be? In case you get a feeling that yeah server
7:33
is something which may be short-term for Oracle then marking operating is
7:37
absolutely right thing but typically okay but I understand you know there may
7:41
be an interpretation issue about the business typically server is like a
7:44
long-term asset which has a life beyond a year and then you kind of replace it
7:48
like after 3 years 5 years but I completely take your point um that in
7:52
case you think that the server usage is so much that after every 3 months 6
7:56
months you got to replace it then it becomes a short-term asset in which case
7:59
buying that short-term asset is operational. Okay, good job. Good job.
8:03
So here everybody, correct answer was investing. But in case your
8:06
understanding is that you know it's dayto-day then it's a separate thing.
8:09
Okay, come on. Let's look at the third one
8:20
for an automobile form. Foxswagen repairing the machinery repairing
8:29
What you want? Come on. Come on. Come on.
8:42
We came so close. We came so close to all of you getting it right.
8:49
When will it be investing activity? What change should I do in the question
8:54
for it to become an investing activity? buying a machinery and
8:59
selling the machinery, even selling the old machinery is an investing activity.
9:03
It's just the using, repairing, maintaining, all of those are day-to-day
9:07
jobs. Okay, but I wish this two would have shifted this side. I swear would
9:12
have been a picture perfect moment. But let's see if we can get it on the next
9:16
one. Let's see the third one.
9:26
This is easy. Come on, everybody. Get this. All right.
9:29
Maximum money. Maximum money. Come on. Come on.
9:36
Come on. Oh god.
9:52
Well, I have a very good news to share that none of you believe that a sle
9:56
proprietor can raise a lot of money. That's actually one of the casual ways
9:59
you know initially an in simple person without registering starting step public
10:03
corporation obviously the right number very good fantastic because doesn't
10:06
matter how rich friends you have the friends are always few and far between
10:11
you can't really substitute the power of billions of people on this planet earth
10:15
public corporation can raise money from anybody public is such a vast term
10:19
therefore LLC you might find some LLC's larger than
10:25
public but this is not a specific speific question about how large is
10:29
OpenAI versus Oracle. This is a question in general about the concept. Therefore,
10:32
public corporation is is large trust uh don't generally kind of outbeat.
10:39
They can be very large trust. I don't disagree. Bill and Melinda Gates
10:42
Foundation for example is almost like $52 billion which is almost like 40% of
10:49
Dubai's GDP. It is like a huge trust but that doesn't mean that you can outclass
10:53
some kind of Apple is $4 trillion. Can you imagine? So that is the power of
11:00
public corporation the size of it. So good answer public corporation. Come on
11:04
we have last chance to get it all right. Let's show it.
11:14
Read it carefully. Don't be in a rush. Heat. Heat.
11:38
limited liability partnerships. A
11:44
that's not very good. What does
11:54
double L in this LLC stand for? Limited liability
11:59
li what does double l here stands for limited liability these two can't be the
12:03
answers in any case and what is public corporation again
12:08
it's a euphemistic form larger form of LLC LLPs are those partnerships which
12:14
according to the special act of the government have protected their
12:18
liability so it is a hybrid between LLC on one hand and partnerships on the
12:22
other you create a gray matter in between LLPs okay but here the Your
12:28
answer was partnership. But it is a very very encouraging
12:32
performance. Very encouraging performance. Let's see who is at the
12:36
top. 4651
12:46
4651. Raise hands. Very good. 4 660.
12:53
Very good. And where is
12:59
again? Okay. All right everybody, round of applause for all you and all others.
13:04
Good job. We can play the slide now.
13:11
Oh, this was much much better than the previous section. Much much better.
13:21
Can we switch on the lights a bit? Yes. It wasn't working in morning. I thought
13:35
sometimes it was everybody today is a day where we have
13:48
already formed four very very important basics in the first two sessions. And
13:52
let me place on record my sincere appreciation because first two sessions
13:55
were the most difficult ones. You have well passed them. So we have spoken
13:59
about debt versus equity. We have spoken about six steps of Elon Musk's
14:02
framework. We have also spoken about the four legal forms and we also spoke about
14:08
operating, investing and financing. So those are the very good building blocks
14:11
for a class on accounting to begin. I repeat myself this is not a rule-driven
14:17
financial reporting. This is a logic-driven class for an entrepreneur.
14:20
So the examples that we will take the discussions we will have especially the
14:24
commerce students who know accounting a bit in terms of accounting standards we
14:28
are not going to go that way we will be speaking to somebody who will never be
14:31
an accountant but wants to read about the business that's it today is the
14:36
first time we will start bringing the aspect of the business health to you
14:41
take patience in today and tomorrow read that as a joint session I wish it was a
14:47
3-hour class we could have handled both the things so there's the possibility
14:51
that there is some spill over from what we are doing today to tomorrow as well
14:54
but we are okay we are in absolutely no hurry all right
15:00
um there was a pre-watch video and I'm
15:04
hoping that some of the non-commerce sees would have seen it so I'm not going
15:07
to go to it and I'm going to come directly at the application the entire
15:12
world of accounting can be divided into five entities for a household for a
15:16
political party for you for me for Teta for Dubai Anybody the world can be
15:21
divided into these five dimensions. First are the elements in my life which
15:25
I call resources. Formal name is assets. What is a resource? When do you call
15:31
something a resource? Whenever you get the benefit. Your best
15:36
friend is a resource or is an asset. Option one because
15:42
because he or she helped yesterday or he or she will help you tomorrow. Which of
15:47
these two options are correct? A best friend is best friend is a
15:52
resource in your life. Come on. Best friend is a resource
15:57
because that person helped you yesterday and saved your life or that person is
16:04
going to help you tomorrow. It is always the tomorrow thing.
16:08
Accountants are very mean, very greedy. We only call those things assets which
16:14
are yet to give us some benefit. Anything that has let's say parents who
16:19
have spent their entire life earning the money and then paying our fees and now
16:24
are physically mentally and financially dependent on us. They will not be called
16:28
as assets. We are very very mean in accounting. But that's what the
16:32
objective way of looking at the businesses. Those parents become a
16:36
liability. What is a liability? Any entity in my life for whom I need to pay
16:42
some money tomorrow. To put it very simply, it's an obligation.
16:47
Okay, I'm going to take now challenging things and everybody I want you to be
16:50
maturely handling those things. Have you paid
16:55
second year's fees to Teta? Is that an obligation on your head?
17:01
Not yet. Good answer. Not yet.
17:06
But you'll have to pay it tomorrow, right? But that's still not an
17:09
obligation on your head. Why? That's for an entrepreneur is important to
17:13
understand because you have not taken the benefit
17:18
from them yet. When does anything become an obligation? When two things happen.
17:23
Number one, you have taken some benefit from them and you have not paid for it.
17:29
Imagine there is a taxi that I will have to take to go back to the airport
17:34
tomorrow afternoon. That taxi is going to cost me let's say 80 dirhams. Is that
17:39
80 dham an obligation on my head still? Is that an obligation? Not yet. You know
17:45
why? Because I have not utilized the service. Next, there is a venture that
17:50
you are going to start very soon with your co-founders and for that you are
17:53
going to raise money from a bank. You are meeting with a bank is fixed for
17:56
12th of November and the bank is most likely uh going to give you the loan. Is
18:02
the bank loan an obligation on your head? No.
18:05
Not yet. Not yet. Obligation is something for
18:10
which you have taken the services or money belonging to somebody and the
18:14
payment is due. I'm going to take now an example of an obligation. Just imagine I
18:19
am paid $1,000 an hour. Okay. I have on day one rendered 6 hours
18:27
of my service to TA 6,000 plus yesterday I rendered 6 hours. Six more,000 12,000
18:35
worth of services I have rendered. Think from Tetar's point of view. Tetar has
18:41
received 12,000 worth of services from a supplier and the payment is due. I am an
18:47
obligation in Tetar's life but only to the extent of classes already delivered
18:52
because that's what Tetar has received. But hey, I'm going to be delivering 6
18:57
hours tomorrow as well. So is my tomorrow's service already an obligation
19:01
on Tetar? Not yet. Am I making sense?
19:05
Yeah. Okay. You are going to buy a laptop
19:08
after 3 years, is that an asset in your life today?
19:11
No. Not yet. You see, we are not
19:14
unnecessarily forecasting the future and bringing it to reality today. We are
19:18
saying whatever actions I'm taking today, whatever transactions I'm doing
19:21
today, if that results into a future cash outflow, that's an obligation. If
19:26
that results into a future cash inflow, that's an asset. As simple as that. Can
19:31
you name five resources which are in your bag right now?
19:37
Laptop, charger, copies, markers, phones, notebooks. These are all
19:42
resources. Why do you call them resources?
19:44
Because they won't provide benefit. Because they will provide benefit. There
19:48
was a student whose notebook that he picked up is entirely filled up. He
19:52
can't use it tomorrow. That means it is no more an asset. People, what is an
19:56
asset? The status will keep on changing. Imagine there was a best friend that you
20:00
had while you were in school. Now you are here. The friend is not reachable,
20:04
contactable etc. Once upon a time somebody you thought is an asset in your
20:07
life. Today is no more an asset. What I'm trying to say is all these are
20:12
dynamic status. It is not like a fixed thing. Somebody is an asset will always
20:16
remain an asset. It's not like that. The values keep on changing. Liabilities
20:20
anybody to whom you have to make the payment tomorrow.
20:24
All right. What is income as an activity and expense as an activity? I want to I
20:30
want to I want to highlight these three animals are very different than these
20:36
two. Income and expenses are activities
20:41
whereas asset liabilities and equity I did not speak about equity at all so
20:45
far. Assets and liabilities are static photographs at the moment. Remember I
20:51
said can you check about how many assets are there in your bag right now? But
20:55
tell me are these five or six assets always in your bag at any point in time
20:59
on every day? No.
21:01
No. At So you told me the status at this very moment. This like a photograph.
21:07
It's only true uh for that very moment. So imagine if Mariam has to take an
21:11
attendance using the photograph method. She clicks a photograph at the beginning
21:15
of the class. There were let's say 42 students.
21:18
Then the 43rd just walked but she was not captured in the
21:24
photograph. Right? So a photograph is only as good as the moment on which it
21:28
is clicked. Are we together on that? Income and expense on the other hand.
21:35
Yeah. So income and expense on the other hand are more like an activity. So tell
21:39
me some incomes for Teta. What activity they do which results into
21:44
an income? providing education admission form and you
21:49
remember admission form also you kind of paid a very small amount for it that's
21:52
also a partial sudo income then main student fees that's a major income and
21:58
then let's say there is some kind of a host fees that you might be paying okay
22:02
that accommodation and boarding and lodging is kind of an income so on so
22:06
forth so any business like a tetar like an aur like all of you will have maybe
22:12
one primary source of income or multiple sources of income.
22:18
Have you heard about a company called as General Electric?
22:21
GE GE one of the largest, one of the oldest like Walmarts.
22:27
How many sources of income do you think they have? Just one or multi.
22:31
That's what is called as a conglomerate. A conglomerate is a business which have
22:36
multiple product lines, multiple sources of income. A company is one which has
22:41
just one source of income. Obviously that is what is called as specialist
22:45
firms but that's where you're taking too much risk concentration risk if that
22:49
product fails that you know you are up for some kind of a damage so here anyway
22:52
so income is an activity by which you generate some kind of a inflow for
22:56
yourself it's an activity uh I'm going to try your performance in cahoot was
23:02
very good higher the incomes that somebody
23:05
generates what can you say about the status of assets that the person will
23:10
have I'm just trying to connect I'm just
23:14
trying to connect broadly drawing some things in your mind just weaker
23:18
connections in case somebody has been generating good levels of income what
23:23
can you say about the level of asset that the person may be possessing
23:28
generally higher generally higher although we can't
23:33
really always swear by this argument but generally you see people who have good
23:37
income have good assets also because asset means let's say money in
23:41
the bank account that's an asset. If somebody has high salary then the money
23:45
in the bank will also be high. That's a kind of a relation between assets and
23:48
income. Okay. Asset is momentary at the moment. Income is over a period of time.
23:54
So how many of you have some kind of a workx before coming here? Paid jobs
23:58
workx work experience. Um would you be kind enough to share the details like
24:03
what profile was that? So I worked in century.
24:07
Okay. Investment company. Fantastic. What was your pay packet? You
24:10
can give us f numbers. That's okay. Like 4,000.
24:15
4,000 dirhams per day a month.
24:19
A month. A month. You see, for an income, you
24:23
need a time period. For an asset, you don't need a time period. How much is
24:29
the bank balance at the moment is what is required. But how much is the income
24:34
over a period of time is will be required. What's the What's the fees
24:38
that Tetar charges? $100,000.
24:43
$100,000. $100,000. Say more about it. $100,000 per year.
24:49
There you go. Okay. I'm just saying the point is not
24:53
that. The point is not that. The point is incomes and expenses are always for a
24:58
particular period. It's not photograph. It's not static. But assets and
25:02
liabilities are static. How much is my obligation? At the very moment is
25:06
somebody asking next. I had taken a bank loan. I had taken their benefit and now
25:11
the payment is due. Is that a liability for me?
25:13
Yeah. Yes. I have repaid the entire bank loan
25:16
today. Will it be an obligation for me tomorrow also?
25:19
That means how do you make sure that the liabilities are lower? Either you don't
25:22
take anybody's benefit or in case you take it, you just repay it on time.
25:26
That's a very simple, you know, is is that point clear? We spoke about Elon
25:32
Musk framework. What was step number one?
25:34
Raising the money. Raising the money. We can raise money
25:36
from two places. Equity and debt.
25:39
Equity and debt. What is how was debt different than equity? The terms and
25:43
conditions of debt were different. We were
25:49
the business was was business was promising to pay the
25:54
money back. Business was under a commitment. So between these two where
25:59
do you think debt fits in? A liability. Debt is a liability but
26:04
only till the point that you repay. Once you repay the debt there's no more
26:07
liability. Are we together? All right. Let's come to a very important but least
26:12
understood concept called as expense. What is an expense?
26:16
Anything I have to pay to gain income. All right.
26:20
Prior invest. Okay.
26:23
Operations cost is expense. Okay. The meaning of simple the word
26:26
expense synonyms costs
26:30
expenditure they all mean the same some people in accounting do PhDs in how is
26:34
an expense different than expenditure that's not relevant discussion for us
26:38
for us expense means anything that I have consumed in the process okay I'm
26:45
going to take a live example I paid three dirhams for this how much is the
26:50
payment that I have done three dhams and it has let us say 300 ml
26:54
ml of water. So 100 ml per 1 dirham. That's the math. I have
27:02
1/3. 1/3. Now it's perfect. 1/3. I have what?
27:10
I have one/3 water. I have fill in the blank. Consumed.
27:16
Consumed. And what about the 2/3? It is left. Somebody asks me at this
27:22
very moment what is the value of my resource what is the value of my asset
27:27
only two asset is not what I pay for asset is what is futuristic benefit that
27:32
I'm left with so two/3 is left which is $2 two dirhams is what is the worth of
27:37
my asset but hey what happened to that one/ird of the water one dirham what
27:41
happened what did I do with it I consume it welcome to expense how much
27:47
did you pay for How much did you pay for?
27:51
Three. But how much did you consume? One. Your expense is not what you pay.
27:56
Your expense is what you consume. Are we together on that?
28:01
Okay people. I want you at this point to bring up a calculator on your handphone.
28:07
Then what's the name of the $3 that you pay like?
28:11
I'll come to that. That was the value of the asset. Then that's the reduction in
28:14
the cash. Okay.
28:16
Okay. I'll come to that. That's a very interesting question. Okay. Just allow
28:19
me one one more minute. Are we all looking at the handphones?
28:29
100,000. Can you write 100,000?
28:33
Yes. This is the fees for full year. Correct.
28:39
Whatever. Let's assume. Let's assume hypothetically. Okay.
28:42
Different for different people, scholarships, different country, blah
28:44
blah blah. I don't want to get into all that. In fact, I don't even know the
28:46
numbers. However, for the sake of the example, 100,000 is the fees, let's say
28:51
for one year. Okay. In one year, how many months do you think the classes are
28:56
going to be? Roughly, let us say 10. Okay. Divide by
29:01
10. What number do you see? Is the allocation per month? Correct.
29:08
In a month, how many hours do they train? Roughly in a month?
29:14
In a week roughly how many hours of training?
29:17
80 hours a week. 240 hours 30 hours. 30 hours.
29:23
Okay. Maybe. So let's say let's say 150 hours
29:28
per month. 150 hours per Can you divide it by 150?
29:39
So you have 10,000 divided by 150 you get 66. What is this 66
29:45
per hour? Dollars per hour is the consumption rate
29:51
with which you are consuming the services of Teta which means your 2hour
29:57
class into two $13
30:03
is your expense after every session. So we started at 10:15, we are going to end
30:11
let's say at 11:45 once the class ends let's say if it's a
30:16
2-hour class for example then you say oh my god I have incurred an expense of 133
30:21
USD but hey you have already paid this amount earlier you did not pay 133 again
30:25
payment is something else and consumption rate is something else are
30:29
we together on that so this is what is very very important for an entrepreneur
30:33
this is what one of the key learning outcomes is expense is not equal to your
30:37
payments. That's what a lay person thinks that I have an expense in my life
30:41
only once I pay. That's not true. I have an income in my life only when I receive
30:45
the money. That's not true. By the way, you see somebody asked my question, how
30:49
was how much was your income yesterday? I said, oh, fantastic income. Did you
30:52
receive in cash also? I said, no, no, no. Cash payment will come later. This
30:56
is one of the important things the entrepreneurs have to understand that
30:59
incomes are not cash flows. Expenses are not cash flows. They are actual work on
31:04
the ground. Okay, I have more things to say. How do you think you're going to
31:10
judge the health of an individual? Imagine I have have I've had severe pain
31:14
in this hand. I go to let's say a doctor. What do you think the doctor
31:17
will ask me to do? It's paining badly the right hand.
31:20
I should take pain. Let's say take some kind of a
31:23
painkiller. You have some biological medicine.
31:26
No, it's all okay. It is just paining since yesterday.
31:29
Rest your hand. So, what do you think?
31:31
Rest your hand. Rest your hand. Okay. All right. What
31:34
else? What else will the doctor suggest me to do?
31:38
X-ray. Why X-ray? What do you think X-ray can
31:41
do what a doctor otherwise could not have?
31:44
Look inside. Have a clearer view which was not visible from the naked hand. Are
31:48
you with me on that? Can I say that X-ray is a medical report
31:52
about a subject matter called as a patient
31:56
and is going to be used by a stakeholder called as a doctor
31:59
in order to make an opinion. That's exactly how the businesses also
32:03
work. Like individuals have medical reports in form of X-ray. What are the
32:07
other reports of an individual? X-ray, MRI, CT scan, blood test for complicated
32:14
cancer-l like diseases, PET scans and so on so forth. Businesses also have
32:18
different reports. But I want to ask a simple question which is very
32:22
foundational. If I have a problem in my brain, will an X-ray help?
32:28
Because it's a different question and the same answer won't work. Therefore,
32:32
you must be very clear about the question that you have to answer.
32:38
Accordingly, I will curate an answer. So, the thing that you see in this box
32:42
is actually the answer and the thing that you see above it is
32:48
the question somebody is asking. So, if somebody's asking about, oh, how is your
32:53
business performing? I have an answer in form of an income statement. So, income
32:57
statement is nothing but like my X-ray. It's like a report which talks about
33:02
some aspect of the health called as bones.
33:05
If I have a problem in bone and I'm getting a CT scan done, something wrong.
33:09
CT scan doesn't show the bones. But if I have problem in nerves,
33:14
if I have problem in nerves, I'm sure X-ray won't help. I need
33:20
another medical report called as CT scan.
33:24
There are three different questions. most important three questions that
33:28
anybody ask these businesses. Number one, dude, what's up with your progress
33:32
on work? Everybody's asking about your performance. I say, hang on, let me get
33:37
you my incomes and expenses. Income minus expense is equal to
33:44
income minus expense is equal to that's it. Profit is a parameter for
33:48
performance. Absolutely simple. But you know, we spoke about it the other day.
33:53
Profit is also called as added value, added value, surplus, gains, so on so
33:59
forth. That's what we are trying to say about the performance. Simple. It is as
34:03
simple as that. Some people especially entrepreneurs get FOMO. Oh my god, how
34:08
can I talk about the performance without talking about my assets, liabilities,
34:13
equity, I'm only taking income and expenses. I'm going back. Only income
34:18
and expenses are required to talk about the performance. You see, three
34:21
dimensions are missed completely. I have only one answer to give to them. When uh
34:26
I am going to talk about let's say to a cardiologist, the cardiologist is going
34:31
to look at the ECG, the bones are not visible. Do I say that ECG is
34:36
incomplete? No. I say that ECG is a specialized report for a particular
34:40
thing. All these reports are very very specialized. That's it. So what is
34:45
performance? How well are you doing your job? What is position after all said and
34:51
done? Have you heard about this English thing? All said and done, where do you
34:54
stand today? Welcome to position. And then the third question stakeholders ask
34:59
is um we are not interested in how you're performing nor we are interested
35:03
in where you are. We're only interested do you have enough money in your pocket?
35:07
That means the liquidity. So therefore that's where the liquidity the third
35:11
statement comes in. How many people have gone to let's say
35:16
this dragon mart or where a lot of haggling happens with the shopkeepers
35:21
not like fixed price. So typically you see what happens is if you are wanting
35:25
to buy something let's say worth 6 and a half dirhams and you have a 50 dirham
35:30
currency they might say can you give me the change you know bring the change
35:35
kind of a thing these times these days everybody pay through a digital cash
35:39
okay but sometimes you have to pay through hard currency that's the
35:43
liquidity problem at the moment I have for example a $100 currency note I am by
35:49
no stretch of imagination am I a poor person It's just that I am illlquid at
35:53
the moment. Why? Because I don't have the required cash which I need at the
35:58
very moment. So these are three different dimensions about the health.
36:03
Please look at the question before answering it. That's what the key
36:06
questions you know for all of you is. Are we together on that?
36:09
Okay. All right. Let's see. This is not for today. This is not for today. I
36:13
don't want to have it. It's just that because I have to give you the slides. I
36:17
am just writing it here. We will make it. We will make it ourselves. That's
36:21
how an income statement looks like. An X-ray, that's how a balance sheet looks
36:25
like. We will make it together. Don't worry about it. What is a balance sheet?
36:29
Nothing. You look at all the assets. You look at all the obligations and
36:34
therefore equity is the remainder. Simple. So you have assets are equal to
36:38
liability plus equity. Today does not make sense. I don't want it to make
36:42
sense. We will soft land. We have till today and tomorrow as well. Okay. So
36:47
basic construct ignore it. basic construct ignore it. Basic construct
36:51
ignore it. That's how a cash flow statement looks like.
36:57
I have this first case for you everybody. 60 seconds. Can you read the
37:02
data? This is a data for a student A versus student B. First year was divided
37:08
into three terms. Term 1, 2 and three. And there is a term
37:13
wise performance and there is a cumulative performance. 60 seconds you
37:17
have to scan the data. You all wanted to be the reader of the
37:23
financial information, right? 30 more seconds.
38:02
Okay. Term-wise, cumulative. How did student B
38:06
perform in term two? Which number are you going to pick?
38:14
It's easier than that. Which number are you going to pick?
38:19
How did student B perform in term two? Simple.
38:28
Okay. Perform is the key word. So performance is always delta. It's always
38:34
periodic. It's like somebody saying, you know, $10,000 per month kind of a thing.
38:38
That's 40. Can I say this 40 has nothing to do with 20? Is it a fair statement to
38:43
make? Can I say 40 has nothing to do with 30? Fair statement to make. This is
38:48
independent. This is independent. This is independent. Those three are deltas
38:51
are independent. Next, is this pen heavy or light? You need what?
38:57
Reference point. What can be a good reference point for the student?
39:00
Number one, you can compare it with your own performance but of a previous year.
39:05
I want you to write this keyword down. Time series analysis.
39:10
Time series analysis is where you compare the same form with its past.
39:15
This is what economies do all the time. India's GDP, Dubai's GDP compared to
39:20
Dubai's GDP last year. You're not changing the unit, but you're changing
39:23
the time period. Can you figure out any other comparable?
39:28
The 40 can be compared with you can compare it with somebody else's but the
39:34
same term. Please write keyword cross-sectional.
39:43
At a particular point in time, should Apple be compared with Nvidia or should
39:47
Apple be compared with Apple's last year? The analyst will have to take a
39:52
call. That's where the judgment is going to be. 2 plus 2 is how much? How much
39:58
would you like it to be? It's not like always a standard thing that time series
40:01
is better than cross-sectional, cross-sectional better than time series.
40:04
We don't know. We really don't know. So depends on the stakeholders what is
40:07
asking the question together. So far on this
40:16
how do you find think about it? Uh I will not fret on it
40:20
too much today. Maybe the third week is where we talk about analysis more. But
40:24
imagine 2020 was the COVID year and if you have to compare the performance of a
40:30
company in the COVID year, the chips are down, the sales are down, profits are
40:34
down. Obviously, if you compare it 2020 with 2019, it's a wrong comparison
40:40
because year has been terribly bad. But a co year performance of Foxswagen can
40:45
be compared with the COVID year performance of Tesla. Here you are
40:49
keeping the time period same but changing the unit of analysis. So it
40:52
depends upon sometimes cross-sectional is better, sometimes time series is
40:57
better. It depends upon what is the question that you have done. Everybody
41:01
accounting is an answer. So, but therefore an answer cannot come first.
41:05
There has to be a question. Please use all your provice to channelize energy to
41:09
get those questions right. Okay. All right. Next question. Where does she
41:12
stand after term two? Where does she stand after term two?
41:18
60. Is it fair to say that term two 60 is independent of what happened in term
41:23
one or this is a wrong statement to make?
41:25
Because you see this is cumulative. This is a position. Therefore, positions will
41:32
have bearings coming from individual performances together.
41:36
Which student perform better in term three?
41:40
Which student perform better? Which number are you looking at?
41:44
35. And comparing it with 10, right? 30.
41:49
30. Correct. Okay. Cross-sectional. Did that student end up being a winner?
41:54
No. Oh, that means it is possible that the company that you are comparing maybe
41:59
your own venture did terrible sales, fantastic, terrific in a particular
42:04
month, but you still were beaten by somebody else. Why do you think that was
42:08
the case in spite of the fact of a good performance
42:11
in the long? Because the starting position of A was
42:16
much behind company B. So if in a race somebody is starting with 10 m ahead
42:24
even if they are running slower they will still end up winning. So you must
42:28
have as an analyst that maturity that you know when performance is the
42:31
parameter for me to judge when position is a parameter for me to judge. Are we
42:34
together on that? Performance means periodic activity. That's it. Per
42:39
position means all said and done. Where are you standing right now? All right.
42:45
Point number three. How do you say if somebody asks you a conceptual question
42:49
is your periodic performance and cumulative positions related to each
42:53
other? Yes or no? First of all, yes. How what is the relation?
43:02
Very good. How is your performance related to position?
43:09
That's it. That's it. Today Elon Musk has a wealth of $267 billion. Is this
43:16
position or performance? Position. How does he have a position
43:21
like that? Because of the historical performances.
43:25
Are we together? All right. Uh if you have to pick one A of the two A
43:32
versus B as the co-founder, who will it be? And more importantly, why?
43:38
Okay. All right. What is a good thing in B?
43:42
Now people, you are reading the data. You're reading the data.
43:46
Finally, B is the winner. That's one good thing about B. Any other good thing
43:51
about B? You see, over a period of time, B's
43:56
results have not varied too much. So, there is a measure in statistics called
44:00
a standard deviation. They measure the variation with respect to your own
44:04
performance. So, standard deviation of B is lower. Volatility is lower compared
44:10
to A. Fair point. These are two good things in B. Anybody is going to choose
44:14
A as the co-founder. Why? What are the good things in A?
44:18
Ability to come back 40 times 35. Okay. The ability you know the sales
44:23
went down but then you know they were able to put their act together. That's
44:26
one good thing about a student over fantastic people analysis and
44:31
observations are not limited to any course. It is a common sense. Now what
44:36
is his performances? How many time periods are we looking at?
44:39
Three. out of three A has beaten B twice. Don't you think like in a boxing
44:44
match there are two rounds that A won. So there is a possibility hypothetically
44:49
that some maybe a family mishap or a medical mishap would have happened with
44:53
a end and end because of which the it's maybe an outlier. Who knows? So in
44:57
analysis while you're reading the data universe is you know really the limit.
45:01
You can kind of draw as many trends as possible. Now I'm going to keep the same
45:06
numbers. You did a fantastic job by the way. I'm going to keep the numbers
45:09
exactly same but I am now changing the marks of a student vizaw the incomes and
45:15
expenses of the company the deltas are always your incomes how much was your
45:21
incomes and profit during a year during the quarter you know there's a entity
45:26
called a stock trader they measure the profit every hour between 9 to 9:30 how
45:31
much was my profit so they make an income statement for 30 minutes
45:35
depending on what is convenient to you it's your business and the wealth or the
45:39
equity is the cumulative thing. Always remember so cumulative and
45:44
periodic stuff these are the things that you'll have to measure. Fill in the
45:48
blank. These are like cahoot questions that
45:51
will come up tomorrow. People please get them right. Very
45:56
fundamental. Performance is dash whereas position is
46:01
dashi. Performance is
46:05
periodic. Very good. and positions are cumulative.
46:09
So you know what happened uh while I was coming here so booked an Uber um and the
46:16
Uber guy in spite of somewhere in the map it was showing it is moving this and
46:20
that was not able to reach till the hotel and I was getting late for the
46:24
class and I called him out of frustration and I asked a question where
46:29
have you reached? Is this the question about the position
46:34
or is this the question about the performance?
46:38
My question. I was shrieking. Where have you reached?
46:47
Am I asking how did you reach where you are or am I asking where are you?
46:55
It's a position. The guy said, the guy said, "Sir, I am standing in front of a
46:59
hotel which reads this sign. This is a static photograph."
47:04
Was he standing here 10 minutes ago? No. Position is obviously changing every
47:09
time. The position is as good as the photograph the moment that you take it.
47:14
Are we together on that? Well, it is going to take a while to get in. Okay.
47:18
All right. Second, performance is dash. Very position is dash.
47:22
Performance is a video. performance is a video graph.
47:25
Dance performance is measured better in looked better in videoraph or a photo
47:30
video. Video running performance. How fast can
47:33
somebody run? Osen bolt video or photo? Video.
47:36
Video. Sales incomes expenses better in a video. Over a period of time, how much
47:41
is your salary over a period of time? How much is your fees? 100,000 is the
47:45
fees for tetar per month. It's not at a particular point in time. These are all
47:50
periodic stuff. All right. Third, Good performance make the position.
47:55
That's it. Regular annual sales, good sales, good profits will make the
48:00
shareholders money grow. That's it. That's what happened. Elon Musk $236
48:05
billion. Income is dash whereas wealth is
48:08
dashform. Performance whereas wealth is position.
48:12
Brilliant. This is not the slide for today, but I
48:16
want you to just take a quick look at these people. You know why? Because
48:19
these are the people who ask business a lot of questions.
48:22
The questions about how well is business doing? Question about what can business
48:26
do tomorrow? So on and so forth. Where do you see yourself against Teta?
48:32
Where do you see yourself against Teta? Absolutely. Where do you see me against?
48:39
That's it. Where do you see Mariam employee? Where do you see Dubai
48:46
government government? Why is Dubai government
48:50
interested in what Tetar is doing? They want to look at the revenue generation
48:53
ability. That's it. They are not interested in anything else. Whether
48:57
they have cash in the pocket, not pocket, postal facility, good or bad,
49:00
etc. Dubai government is only interested in collecting some taxes. That's about
49:04
it. Okay, but this is not the slide that we got to do today. Match the following.
49:08
Application time concepts are over. I'm so excited.
49:11
Can you see the business here? Where do you see business
49:16
in this photo? They want to see something.
49:18
Very good. Where is the business in this photograph?
49:22
Inside. Inside. Brilliant. Where do you see
49:24
stakeholders in this photograph? You see these three people are
49:27
stakeholders. They want to know find out something about the business. And where
49:31
do you see financial statement in this? The window. What is the role of
49:37
financial statement? What was the role of X-ray by the way? What did you say?
49:42
To see what was inside which was not visible otherwise from the naked eye. I
49:46
was X-ray did for my bones. That's exactly what financial statements do
49:50
with the businesses. They are able to tell something which is happening inside
49:54
to an outsider. I'm not a fan of this too much but
49:59
nonetheless. Where do you see business? On the table.
50:03
On the table. You see where do you see a stakeholder?
50:07
Blindfolded. A blindfolded guy is trying to make some sense about uh why can't he
50:12
just remove and see? All stakeholders can't come inside. Before I came to
50:16
Dubai for this training, I had no idea what the classrooms look like, what the
50:21
kind of students they will have, where will I stay. That's what I was
50:24
blindfolded. Before you come to Dubai for you signing
50:28
up for Teta, you did not have as much clarity as you have now.
50:32
Stakeholders are always blindfolded and only through the deal they become more
50:36
informative. That's always the case. Your customers drop shipping that you
50:39
are going to sell some products. Your customers will experience and know about
50:43
you more only after they have made a sale with you. So far it's just a
50:46
marketing brochure. So here these are the stakeholders. This is the business.
50:52
Where do you see financial statement? This fellow is the financial statement.
50:58
Somebody who is guiding the blindfolded people to take a decision about the
51:01
business. Are we together on that? Okay.
51:09
Only thing left for today, let me tell you, and I'm so excited about it. Slide
51:13
one. Slide two. Slide three. That's it.
51:21
Ready? I want you to read through the three transactions without any pressure,
51:25
without any question in your mind. Just read through these three
51:40
transactions without any pressure. Accounting is not about rules.
51:57
Accounting is noting very carefully with a myopic eye what is business doing in
52:05
the transaction. Done sorted. Have you gone through it?
52:14
All right. Reconnect. Which one of these is operating, investing or financing? MR
52:19
selling a commercial plot costing so and so for so and so. Is this operating,
52:23
investing or financing activity for MR? MR builders. We buy a house. It's a
52:33
long-term asset for us. MR sells it on a almost daily basis every day. This is an
52:38
operating activity. Fair point. All right. Uber.
52:47
Is it like a one time payment in life? No.
52:51
Operating. Okay. for the business here. Operating,
52:55
investing or financing? Apple is raising money.
53:01
You guys are wonderful. Next question.
53:06
Remember first day we spoke about Elon Musk six steps.
53:09
Stay with me. This is which step? There is no rush. 15 seconds. 15 seconds
53:17
everybody take. 15 seconds everybody take.
53:20
15 seconds everybody take. There's no rush. This is with step of
53:26
Elon Musk. This is step
53:35
three or C. This is where customer comes into the
53:39
life of the business. The stage is already set. The business has already
53:44
started operation. Funding have been blah blah blah. Now it's a time for
53:46
customer to come in. That's where the customer are coming in.
53:50
Second question, which step of Elon Musk are they buying a legal resource and
53:59
making it their own or they're paying for something that they hired some
54:02
expense D for Delhi that's what we call as cost
54:08
expense expenditure right and this you're raising money
54:15
whether it is raised from equity or debt doesn't matter are we together
54:20
Now my question to you is now you have understood the business very well. My
54:23
question to you is if MR builder does this transaction will its liquidity in
54:29
terms of cash flows be impacted? In addition to that in addition to that
54:35
will their profitability be impacted and don't forget profitability is nothing
54:39
but income minus expense is equal to profit. That's what the definition of
54:43
surplus and profits are. what you receive as your services minus you know
54:48
the consumptions that you've had. So here I want you to think about
54:53
transaction one in your mind. Put a number in your mind as well. The number
54:58
orientation is important everybody. Are you ready?
55:04
This transaction will increase the profits or decrease the
55:09
profits? The profits
55:10
by how much? That's it. Brilliant. How do you arrive
55:15
at five? Income minus expense. That's what profit
55:22
was. You're saying that okay fine my performance have become better by five.
55:27
Performance is measured by profits. Right? Okay. How much is the impact on
55:31
liquidity? How much is the impact on liquidity? By
55:41
what amount has the cash in hand gone up?
55:44
80 million. 80 million.
55:45
I see two answers. Five or 80? 80.
55:49
By what amount has the liquidity of business? You see, somebody is asking
55:52
another question now. Somebody's not interested in your performance of
55:55
position. They're saying how liquid have you become. So therefore, what will you
55:59
say? How much cash do you get? Now people think about it. There are so
56:04
think about how much did the customer pay MR
56:09
80. And how much did Mr. pay to the at the time of buying the plot? 75. But my
56:14
question is I hope you read the transaction well. Is this the
56:18
transaction for buying or selling or both?
56:20
Both. This is only for selling
56:25
people. While at the time of drop shipping you might be doing your buying
56:28
and selling together but while you are creating your own brand in trimester 2
56:32
term two in India you'll have to buy the inventory keep it with you. That means
56:36
payment to suppliers will happen on a different day and then try and create a
56:40
brand and sell it. Sales and purchase happen on different dates. This is a
56:43
transaction only for sales. This is not a purchase day transaction.
56:49
I'm sure last year 3 months ago, yesterday whenever they would have
56:54
purchased it for 75 then liquidity would have been impacted. No doubt. But today
56:59
is not that day. Today is where only the customer comes in. Remember you said
57:03
this is step C. Customer is coming in. Customer will pay them how much? 80.
57:09
Now see the damage. In case you are not sure about what my profitability says
57:15
and what my liquidity says and investor asks you a question, how good is your
57:19
performance? You say my performance is tremendous. My performance is 80.
57:23
Investor is going to write you off immediately before giving you the money.
57:27
People your performance is not measured in cash. Your performance is measured in
57:31
action on the ground. Yesterday and the day before my
57:36
performance was amazing because I delivered a lot of service but my
57:39
liquidity was still zero because I was not paid as yet. Are we
57:44
together on that? There are some moments where performance
57:47
and liquidity happens on the same time. I'll take an example of Uber driver.
57:51
Uber driver hires a passenger and drops him uh charges 80 dham. So he has
57:56
delivered the job also on the same day receives the money also on the same day.
58:00
So therefore both of the statements will talk the same tune.
58:04
Let's take Uber's example. Let's take Uber's example. Uber paid 1.1 million as
58:10
annual fees for the last 12 months. Whom will they have paid to?
58:14
Government. Government. Okay. By what amount will
58:17
their liquidity go down? 1.1.
58:20
1.1. Brilliant. Somebody asking a question. Oh, does it
58:24
improve the liquidity? No, no, no. It has worsened the liquidity.
58:28
By what amount has profitability being impacted if at all?
58:33
We cannot say by what amount will the profitability of
58:37
Uber be impacted? Yes.
58:43
Is this income or expense? If income remains same and expense goes
58:48
up, what happens to the profit? Comes down.
58:52
People this is the point I was driving home. Look at Uber versus MR. Both the
58:56
statement talking the same tune but both the statement talking about so different
58:59
tunes. You cannot always assume that liquidity
59:03
and profitability will be same. Okay. In your businesses also maybe
59:09
sometimes a customer will say hey I want to test the goods try the goods and then
59:13
I will pay in which case you will deliver the goods let's say on 15th of
59:17
September but then the customer pays you on 20th of September. So when did you do
59:22
your job 15th income statement is impacted profitability is impacted but
59:27
the liquidity will come 5 days later. Welcome to credit sales. Credit sale
59:32
means you're delivering the job but the the customer is not paying. Are these
59:36
two clear? Welcome to the third one. Apple is raising money by what amount
59:40
has the liquidity gone up? Fair point. More money in the bank.
59:49
And is this an income or an expense? No.
59:53
Is this a sale of an iPhone? Is this consumption of a service? Neither. Every
59:57
transaction will not impact everything. Art of communication is not to know what
1:00:04
to say. It is to know what not to say. Therefore, it is important to know that
1:00:10
this statement will not hit my profitability. So if somebody says your
1:00:15
venture has raised a lot of money from a lot of investors and somebody says man
1:00:20
your work is amazing you're going to say no the work means income and expenses
1:00:26
that is yet to begin a it is just step a initial funding has been raised initial
1:00:31
funding is not your performance are we together on that okay
1:00:36
here people read the three peacefully without
1:00:43
any pressure. without any pressure. You guys are doing
1:01:15
a very good job. Done.
1:01:19
Yeah. Operating, investing or financing.
1:01:23
Investing. Anybody think otherwise?
1:01:32
Operation Okay.
1:01:41
Yeah, exactly. You're right. Okay.
1:01:56
Okay. May I ask a counter question? Has this
1:02:01
transaction happened? Therefore, in accounts, we don't worry
1:02:07
about things that will happen. Accounting is not forecasting.
1:02:11
Accounting is taking record of things that have happened in your life and then
1:02:15
looking at the measure of it. Okay? So, I'm not going to record it anywhere.
1:02:19
It's a forecast. We'll cross the bridge when it comes next.
1:02:25
Nestle return so and so billion of loans along with interest of so and so.
1:02:33
Because which which supply which stakeholder are
1:02:41
you dealing with? Bank.
1:02:43
Bank. What did you do with the bank? Your day-to-day job or
1:02:47
money. Raising the money.
1:02:49
Raising the money is debt and equity. That means it's financing. What are you
1:02:54
saying? Whether it's a short-term loan, right?
1:02:58
Whether it is a short-term loan. Is it your main job to raise money or is it
1:03:02
your for Nestle your main job is to make chocolates and sell
1:03:06
you need money to in order to do that I'm not denying that tetar main job is
1:03:11
not to buy the projector main job is to hire a trainer and teach the student we
1:03:16
need a projector in order to facilitate this transaction are we together on that
1:03:20
people financing and investing activities are not alien activities they
1:03:23
are done so that we can do operational activities well why did you buy the
1:03:27
laptop so that you can study at a studying is your operational job. Buying
1:03:32
laptop is your investing job. Are we together on that?
1:03:35
In case you didn't have money, going to a bank to take a loan, that's a
1:03:40
financing activity. Using the money to buy a laptop, that's an investing
1:03:44
activity. Now, using the laptop to study, that's operational.
1:03:48
Are we together on that? So, therefore, this is a financing activity. Nestle is
1:03:52
dealing with bank. Apple incorporation buyback stocks worth
1:03:59
USD90 from existing shareholders, operating, investing or financing.
1:04:04
Very good. Fantastic.
1:04:08
So far so good. Okay. Which out of these three will have a liquidity impact?
1:04:15
Which out of these three have a liquidity impact? No impact because this
1:04:19
is not a transaction only. So forget about it.
1:04:23
This will go down by 1.3
1:04:26
1.3 1.1 Yes. 0.2 2 1.3
1:04:32
the cash will go out by 1.3
1:04:35
1.3 you're paying 1.1 that originally you
1:04:39
borrowed and then as a rent on capital you are paying more that's what we call
1:04:42
as interest so therefore your cash will activity that you saw
1:04:50
when I say cash flow from financing will flow that's it
1:04:56
you don't even have All you need to know how big a cash
1:05:00
statement is. You know operating investing financing that you already
1:05:04
have done. All you need to know is to see whether cash is coming in or going
1:05:07
out because yourself
1:05:25
got home at the beginning of the month this month. That's what we're doing
1:05:32
here for us for India. We do cash
1:05:42
out pays to existing shareholder. it is an
1:05:58
outflow of 19 operating in
1:06:04
again so I can say while making capital goes up
1:06:09
never worry about capital easy
1:06:16
if this transaction point number two along with some
1:06:26
performance 1.1 your return is that is that original
1:06:41
amount that was never lost only 0.2 two over and above the rent on
1:06:53
capital. That's your expense because 1.1 was never
1:07:00
therefore expense goes up. So my profit goes down by
1:07:08
liquidity has dried up tremendously but the marginally the two statements show
1:07:14
so different stories. When you repay the loan, your business
1:07:19
is not in any losses. These are
1:07:23
the basic problem that lay person is the most important aspect. When cash
1:07:32
come in from bank, you are not solving any
1:07:39
problem. You are postponing the problem because tomorrow you have to repay
1:07:43
right. Whenever you raising money from equity, you are damaging yourself.
1:07:53
Therefore, your heading cash from customer is the
1:07:58
best. Receiving cash from anywhere is not the best.
1:08:02
the best companies that you can pay some good very strong companies
1:08:08
Apple customers pay huge amount that's the
1:08:15
thing that we have to look for my customers pay
1:08:21
is not a good time
1:08:28
you know this and that from
1:08:35
the customer. Therefore, it is not just the cash. It
1:08:42
is cash flow from operation which is okay and we will obviously reinforce
1:08:51
again and again. Point number three. Point number three.
1:09:03
profit is my performance. Performance is my income. These are the activities that
1:09:07
I do on a regular basis. Uh for error this is like
1:09:14
form it is like selling for Apple is like selling iPhone
1:09:21
customer income.
1:09:43
What happens to the stock price is not the problem of the business. It is the
1:09:47
problem of some people out in the capital market which are creating some
1:09:51
stock markets are never recorded in the business statement.
1:09:55
on the ground. Think very very carefully like that.
1:10:03
Therefore, we talk to everybody. Uh the most important slide for today is
1:10:11
this. It is extremely important for you to categorize what is an asset for me,
1:10:17
what is a lifetime, what is an income, what is an expense.
1:10:21
How many people have a habit of going and buy something for lunch
1:10:29
on the ground floor. Yeah. What is the break up of the activities that you do?
1:10:34
You reach the bottom, you place an order and then you make the payment. Okay. So
1:10:39
far the payment has been made cash outflow and 2 minutes you receive a
1:10:45
sandwich. Is this sandwich at that very moment
1:10:51
an asset, a liability, an income and expense or
1:10:57
you have a sandwich worth that sandwich
1:11:05
right now which is delicious which can give you
1:11:12
benefit. At the time,
1:11:20
let us say it is 100 p.m. The sandwich is an acid. You put 30 minutes to eat
1:11:28
it. You have consumed it. Now what you value of that asset? Can
1:11:34
you consume it again? No. Therefore, the value of the asset has become zero. So
1:11:38
what happens to this ball in the asset? becomes an expense. What is the keyword
1:11:45
for expense? You see every year you're going to use
1:12:05
consume laptop. So after a year will not be brand new it
1:12:11
will become old. So what happen after a year your asset future benefit is going
1:12:16
to be only the remaining 500 the balance what you consume by usage by leaving
1:12:22
whatever else that's going to be an expense
1:12:26
everything like natural so therefore Whatever
1:12:45
that's my whatever is potentially that's my
1:12:52
best move towards these
1:12:59
smaller you stop here this is one important
1:13:03
point of the last slide we could not cover it with them therefore I want to
1:13:07
maintain the uh you know the parity with you this is a very very important again
1:13:15
what you pay is not what you what you receive is not what you deserve
1:13:20
to receive that's where the performance will and followed by tomorrow is the
1:13:27
first time yourself and
1:13:33
okay so I'm very very excited uh your performance was very good because we
1:13:38
could finish 15 minutes sooner it's a simple people.
1:13:43
All right. I I do it.
1:14:25
You want to
1:14:45
do the same?

What does your income statement reveal about profitability, sustainability, and efficiency, and why do profitable companies still face cash crises?
22/09/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:01
No, show me. We never right. Show me.
0:08
Let's do that 100%. People think about it. It's not about which country, which
0:12
you know so on and so forth doing, but think about the logic. Cash flows talk
0:16
about and answer what question. How much are you left with in terms of cash? So,
0:21
you're going to focus on the cash flows. Profit does not answer how much is the
0:25
cash that you are left with. profit answer is how much is the surplus
0:29
revenues over cost income minus expenses whether in cash or not are you left with
0:35
that surplus has to do with what you are actually doing on the ground so the
0:39
whole thing between remember the three dimensions of financial health
0:42
performance position and liquidity performance was how is the progress on
0:48
the work so work is important how much is a rental services that you have
0:52
consumed from landlord 100 whether paid or
0:56
Are you with me on that? Okay, let's do it. Second question.
1:08
Same question but a different parameter is being asked.
1:48
Okay. Okay.
1:53
All right, next question. Let's go to the next question.
2:55
You underpaid. Very good. So you consumed more.
2:59
You consumed more but you did not pay as much. So that amount that you've
3:04
consumed has to be paid tomorrow. Even if you haven't paid today, you'll have
3:07
to pay tomorrow. So it's going to be an obligation. So therefore correct option
3:10
is it's an outstanding expenses. Why outstanding? because you've consumed but
3:14
not pay and it's going to be an obligation.
3:18
Okay. So let's say you know while coming from the hotel to this place the uh
3:22
kharim the bill was 12 dirhams. Okay. It was like right next corner and when I
3:29
was getting out and I was about to tap my card at that very moment if somebody
3:35
asked me a question how much is the consumption of taxi services that I have
3:39
done I'll say I've already consumed 12 dhams. How much have you paid for?
3:44
Nothing as yet. I'm going to pay next minute. But till the time you pay, isn't
3:49
that 12 Ds an obligation on your head? Absolutely right. Because I've consumed
3:53
the services from the taxi driver and I'm yet to pay for it. That's exactly
3:56
the thing with the the balance 40 here. You've consumed the services from the
4:01
landlord, but you are yet to pay the full amount. The balance that you could
4:05
not pay is going to be an obligation. Are you together on that everybody?
4:09
Okay. Next. Ah,
4:38
heat. Come on.
4:52
Come on. Again the same. What was the question? Was the question
4:59
on liquidity or performance? Liquidity or profitability?
5:05
Profitability. For profitability what is important is how much you consume not
5:11
how much you pay. So how much salary services did you consume from the
5:16
employees? If the salary paid is 110 but the salary
5:22
bill was only 100 that means you deserve to pay only 100. By chance you have paid
5:27
more this time but that doesn't mean that your profits are going to be go
5:31
going down. So here only $100 is the service which is build due is going to
5:38
come as your expense in your profitability and therefore uh the
5:43
fourth option was the right one. Next Yeah. So 100 was due but you've actually
6:29
paid 110. So the extra 10 is overpaid or underpaid overpaid this time. So that's
6:36
paying more paying in advance that's always an asset because either employees
6:40
are going to return this money back or they will you'll not have to pay for it
6:43
when they work. In both the cases some future resource some benefit that you
6:48
see future benefits are assets. Anything that will give you a benefit tomorrow
6:53
like your phone, like your wallet, like your laptops, like your you know
6:57
smartwatches, like your shoes, anything that is worth something tomorrow is a
7:02
resource for you today. Are you with me on that everybody people at this point?
7:07
Because um I remember last session four all of you were very good and therefore
7:12
I'm trying to explain something uh new. Uh what happens when you go for a bank
7:18
loan? Can you break the thing down the transaction?
7:23
So you enter the bank, there's always an application and the banker says, "Okay,
7:26
fine. Your application is approved and here is your money. Okay. Now you can
7:31
use it to buy a car. You can use it to buy uh let's say an education. So it
7:35
could be an education loan, home loan, mortgages, whatever else. My question to
7:39
you is how many things have you dealt with in the bank?
7:47
Not one but two. Generally we say bank loan is an obligation or a resource.
7:54
Bank loan is an obligation or a resource.
8:01
Now you see these are the two things that you have dealt with and hence the
8:04
confusion and hence we are discussing it. What did bank give you?
8:10
Money that's a resource. But what did you give to the bank?
8:17
interest to you will pay after 3 months. What did you give to the bank right
8:20
here? Right there. You give something. You give something.
8:28
You received money. That's a resource that you can use for anything. But what
8:32
did you give to the bank at that moment? Promise.
8:37
That's it. You gave a promise to repay. That promise to repay is the loan. The
8:42
money that you received is not the loan. people think about it. Think about it. I
8:48
will take an example of uh some countries where they have some
8:52
subsidies. You know how subsidies work. Government gives you something and don't
8:56
ask you to pay it back. My question to you is imagine there is a startup you
9:00
know entrepreneurial promotion u scheme by Dubai uh here and then they say that
9:06
you know anybody who wants to buy a machinery they can and for that they
9:10
don't have the money no problem come to any bank and take a 20% subsidy 20%
9:15
subsidy means that the promoter ends up paying only 80% back and 20% will be
9:20
handled by the government are we together so here is one teta promoter
9:24
who goes and enters the bank let's say machine value is net 100. So how much is
9:30
a loan that you need? 100. So you enter the bank branch to take a 100 rupee
9:35
loan. How much money will the bank give you?
9:39
100. That 100 is a resource. But how much do you have to repay?
9:46
That means at that moment your obligation is not 100. It is only 80.
9:51
Obligation is not what bank does for you. obligation is what you promise to
9:56
pay back. Are you with me on that?
10:00
So these are like finalities of this is not accounting. This is looking at a
10:04
business transaction with a micro lens. So whenever let's say um how many people
10:10
have ordered from Domino's, Pizza Huts etc. You see now the the Domino's
10:16
delivers what? Pizza. Pizza is a resource but Domino is
10:23
a supplier. Supplier may be an obligation. Pizza is
10:28
always going to be a resource. So when let's say you order something, there are
10:32
two associates you're dealing with. You're dealing with pizza which you have
10:36
ordered to buy and there is a supplier to whom you are requesting that you know
10:42
can you please supply that thing? I will make the payment to you. Domino's is
10:45
maybe an obligation in your life but pizza can never be an obligation in your
10:49
life. Pizza is always going to be a resource. Are you with me on that? You
10:53
have to look at businesses with a micro lens, with a fine lens. Accounting then
10:57
becomes very easy that way. Are we together? All right. Next question
11:02
before we is equity an obligation?
11:12
Is equity an obligation on the business? What happened in the bank? Uh bank gave
11:19
you the money. You say fine, I'll pay you back. That pay you back promise is
11:23
an obligation. Right? With equity, what happened? When equity gives you the
11:26
money, what do you give them? A promise to pay back. No. Therefore, equity is
11:32
not an obligation. What do you give to equity? Ownership.
11:37
You are never liable towards your owners. owners own you.
11:42
All right? So, debt is an obligation. Equity is not an obligation. And these
11:46
are the finer things that you know as a businessman you have to understand. All
11:49
right. Next. Oh, that's done. All five done. All
11:54
right. So, who is 29107? Very good. Myra, good job done
11:59
everybody. Round of applause. Fantastic. Fantastic. And 29129.
12:06
Very good. Good job. and 29017. Good job. That's fantastic people. The
12:14
thing with winning and losing is anybody can win, anybody can lose very frankly.
12:18
So don't take anything for granted. Oh, I could not get anything yesterday.
12:22
Therefore, it means that I won't get anything today. That's an absurd
12:25
statement to make. Today is a fresh day. Yesterday may be you see performance for
12:28
every year is independent of each other. Performance of yours in quiz one is very
12:33
different than quiz 2 may be very different. Yes, position is cumulative.
12:37
I understand. So overall position I am my CGP etc. That's going to take some
12:41
time to performances you can change very quickly.
12:47
So here everybody I just want to give you a quick heads up about where we are
12:50
in the overall course. 13 sessions equal to 20 hours. Okay nicely divided into
12:55
three weeks. One week has already gone by. Second week is where we are all in.
13:00
So in the first week which was the previous one we focused on understanding
13:04
the business hardly any accounting. We covered some of the basics. Remember 3
13:09
to 12 core principles will make the entire discipline. That three to core
13:13
principles is what I have mentioned here itself. You cannot afford to miss even
13:18
while you are dying. What is operating? What is investing? What is financing? It
13:22
is absolutely mandatory for you to appreciate the six steps in the you know
13:27
Elon Musk framework. Absolutely important. Legal forms of doing
13:31
business. What is limited liability? All of those things are mandatory for you to
13:34
remember. you cannot you know go easy on them. And then in the on the last
13:39
session on Thursday, we did one case on drop shipping where it was like the
13:44
first time that all of you made an income statement, made a a cash flow
13:48
statement, bank balance and profitability. And also we went pushed
13:53
the envelope too hard to say fine uh how much is the list of resources, assets.
13:57
How much are the list of obligations, liability? And therefore we also got to
14:01
the equity although we did not stress too much upon equity as much on that
14:05
day. So um it was it was like a soft landing but this week what we're trying
14:09
to do is the following. This is a very very critical week because this not only
14:14
will have to capture on the learnings from the first it also will build a base
14:20
for the analysis week which is going to be in October. So in analysis week you
14:24
will be spending time in reading the data not writing it. So the class will
14:29
begin with what you're producing today. A income statement, a balance sheet, and
14:34
a cash flow will be given to you, prepared by somebody else, and then
14:38
you'll have to just read it, infer it, analyze it. But here's the point. Unless
14:43
you yourself are a dancer, you can't really judge somebody else's dance
14:47
moves. So therefore, in order to make the judgment on somebody else's books of
14:52
accounts to these, this week, week two, is where you will have to really go deep
14:57
into that. And by that, we don't mean hard concepts. we mean diverse concepts,
15:02
more common sense applications and that's about it. So that's going to
15:05
happen in phase two and phase two is going to we are going to meet like five
15:10
times Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and then uh I think Thursday, Friday is
15:14
where we are having double classes. So either I think with you we are meeting
15:18
twice on Thursday or we are meeting with you twice on Friday. So that's also in
15:22
in in total roughly you know we have five sessions including today.
15:28
All right. So I'll tell you what do we have to do today and what's my plan.
15:33
On Thursday I felt that about 30% of the students were comfortable but 70% were
15:37
not. It's like somebody for the first time is learning driving. How do you do?
15:41
You teach them something. So there is a learning and then there is a practice.
15:44
What's the difference between learning versus practice?
15:48
Learning versus practice. Practice comes after we've learned. Very
15:54
good. But what happens in learning? Somebody tells us that you know fine
15:59
this is the accelerator this is the brake this is you know the console this
16:02
is the indicator but then practice means I am getting comfortable with it I am
16:06
utilizing it I'm using those services and then trying to become a pro so uh
16:11
learning happened maybe in session four the practice has to happen today so case
16:15
one for today very simple very basic this is like a little bit of like 10
16:20
minutes job that's it but the main case for today is very similar to session
16:23
four similar template will be given to you
16:26
but this time you will be more independent last time I was protruding
16:30
you know a lot with your progress etc that you know how is everybody doing
16:33
today you'll have to do it all by yourself it's practice it's like driving
16:38
okay and in addition to that let's see if once we have got the solution can we
16:44
play this if and then analysis if this would have happened how would
16:49
your answer change if this would have happened how would your answer change so
16:52
you see using one single case we are actually doing five more cases
16:57
once you have something on Excel it becomes easy to change so therefore
17:02
using one so that's how you utilize technology for your gains so anyway so
17:07
we come back there is no time pressure whatsoever this is the first you know of
17:13
the businesses that we have to deal with they are making three transactions and
17:18
somebody has asked you not to calculate how much make the balance sheet not to
17:23
make P&L not to make the cash flow. They're just simply asking you, can you
17:28
calculate these five based on these three? That's it.
17:33
That's it. People
17:55
please don't take any pressure of getting it right. It's okay.
18:19
This is a safe space. Commit mistakes, learn. Commit mistakes. Ask doubts,
18:25
learn. That's it. You can do it on pen paper. You can do
18:32
this one on on anywhere. After these three transactions,
18:53
somebody's asking you how much is trade receivable, trade payables.
18:59
Any term you don't understand you can ask me, ask
19:04
a friend. on cash.
19:37
Yeah. So, um here that's actually a good point. Um whenever it says on cash, it
19:44
means using bank accounts, using wallets, using any kind of things. Okay.
19:51
Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. Where would you want or you want to maybe the
19:54
same thing? Yeah. So cash does not mean only in cash like
20:02
hard currency. It means using online wire transfers, using APIs, payment
20:09
gateways, anything. Once you have calculated all five
21:12
quietly raise hands whether right or wrong doesn't matter so that I would
21:17
know you know how to paste the class okay you can just raise hands and put it
21:22
down Is it 20% or is it
22:54
So this question you should ask the chat deputy again.
23:45
Okay, about 20% of you have raised hands.
23:56
You are a very smart entrepreneur. So when you come to an accounting class,
24:01
don't think you're entering a zone which does not belong to you. Accounting is
24:05
for entrepreneurs by entrepreneurs. It's just that they are so busy so they
24:11
hired somebody else and they called that person accountant. It's like same thing
24:14
that you will hire a CMO, chief marketing officer later. But at the
24:17
beginning stage, you'll have to do the whole thing. Now the
24:21
so as an entrepreneur, your job is not just to know about the product. Your job
24:26
is not just to know how to make a crack and sale. It's not just to kind of raise
24:31
money from investors. have to know about your business.
25:09
I'm not giving the answers but I want to discuss the transactions. What is
25:13
happening the give and take in transaction one? Goods purchased on
25:17
cash. What is the business buying? So inventory comes in and what goes out?
25:22
Cash. Cash. Simple. It's a simple trade-off.
25:25
Second, 20% of the goods purchased, meaning worth how much? 2,000. Very
25:30
good. 20% of 10,000 is 2,000. That were given to somebody we call our customer.
25:37
And the customer promised to pay how much
25:41
25% more than that. So 25% was nothing but 1x4 of 2,000 is 500. So, is it fair
25:49
to say that 2,000 worth of goods you add some markup and you sell for 2500? Is
25:57
that a fair point to say? And I'm using the same exam. Cost price plus profit is
26:02
equal to the selling price. That's the same exam, right? It's like
26:07
the very basic exam of all businesses that cost price or costs plus profits
26:12
must be equal to the selling price. So here 500 is what is the markup margin
26:20
profit by different names called? Are we together on that? Is this 500 received
26:25
in cash? Has this five? My bad. My my bad. Is
26:30
this 2500 being received in cash? Then what did a customer give us?
26:35
Customer has taken us what from us? No. No. Customer has taken what from us?
26:40
Goods worth 2,000. This is what I give. Remember business is profitable when
26:44
give and take are different. What you give is less and what you take is more.
26:48
What did the business give? Very good. What did the business
26:51
receive? Or promise. Promised by somebody to pay
26:56
us tomorrow. What is the worth of the promise?
27:00
2500. The customer by chance may not even know
27:04
that the goods costed at 2,000. That will happen with drop shipping ventures
27:07
also. You're going to buy something from let's say gold souk or some other Mina
27:11
vazar kind of a market for maybe let's say 10 dirhams but you will list it on
27:15
the website at 100 dirham will the customer know that you purchase it for
27:18
10 dham never you know the fees of teta correct fees
27:25
is the selling price for the business but do you know how much they pay me no
27:30
how much is a rental nobody knows what's inside so anyway as a business we know
27:35
so customer will promise to pay plus 2500 by chance. This is not a cash but
27:40
it's a promise. All right, no problem. Next transaction. 10% of the goods
27:44
purchased. That means a,000
27:48
were sold for cash. Thank God this time it's cash. But oh my god, at a loss of a
27:55
10% on the cost. So that means 10% of,000 is 100. And the customer this
28:02
time did the customer promise to pay us something tomorrow or did they pay us?
28:06
they paid us. So, end of story. No followup. So, here um how much is the
28:12
total cost that I have used? How much is the total profit?
28:19
And how much is the total sales? 3,400. So at the time of drop shipping or any
28:25
venture that you will you know let's say in India when you come there is a D2C
28:28
you know that they will kind of make you work on um where direct to customers you
28:33
have to build your own websites and you know have your own inventories and so on
28:36
so forth. Some of you will actually set up small manufacturing setup as well. So
28:41
think about it next semester is going to be very exciting that way. But in any
28:45
case initially when the business is small you can count the transactions.
28:49
This is a sale I did did there. That is a sale. Oh, how many sales today? Oh, I
28:53
made three orders. It's countable. But imagine Apple iPhones 17 being launched
28:59
being sold in 50 countries. There are so many sales order. Can they count
29:04
transaction by transaction? Difficult. So how they calculate profits and all?
29:07
By looking at the sum totals. By looking at the sum totals,
29:13
summations. So how much is the overall sales of the business? They're not going
29:17
to tell you 2500, 900. They say total sales is 3,400.
29:22
How much is the overall cost of units sold?
29:28
3,000. What is the what is the question? How
29:33
much is the cost of units that you're selling, not the units that you're
29:37
purchasing? So, it's 3,000. And just think about it. If out of 10,000
29:43
3,000 you have sold the remaining 70% or 7,000 must be the
29:50
balance of inventory. Are you with me on that? So inventory and COGS are quite a
29:56
substitute of each other. You sell more lesser inventory. You sell less more
30:00
inventory. And then so how much is credit customer? Credit customer.
30:04
Anybody out of these two promise to pay us? Yes.
30:09
2500 is the credit customer. also called as trade receivable. The
30:16
word trade means pure operational day-to-day job. So in a day-to-day
30:21
dealing, is there somebody from whom the business has to receive something
30:26
tomorrow? Why will business receive something from that person tomorrow?
30:29
Because that person has purchased my goods today. And what is trade payable?
30:35
Exactly opposite. Any supplier who supplied the goods to us uh which is
30:39
unpaid. So here is there a supplier from whom we bought the goods? Yes. But is
30:44
that supplier unpaid? Zero.
30:51
It's not necessary that you must have credit customers. You must have credit
30:55
suppliers. Teta does not have any credit customer
30:59
but they have credit suppliers. They are utilizing my service but not paying. But
31:04
for you they're charging money first. Depends upon the business to business.
31:08
Some some business always deal in cash. They don't want to do anything on
31:12
credit. So they will have zero credit customers, zero credit suppliers. It's
31:15
up to you. And then profits. Profit was nothing but revenue minus cost. So your
31:19
revenue is 3,400. Your cost is 3,400 is your profit.
31:28
Are we together on that? 100%. All right. So let's see if you can do the
31:34
second one. Yes.
31:52
Profit is the total income minus expenses or revenues minus cost. Revenue
31:58
is the dealing with customers. You had two transactions with customers 2500 and
32:04
900 which is 3,400 in total and cost is 3,000.
32:15
So transaction one and transaction two.
32:23
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. You've written it nice. So
32:28
this overall is your overall cost
32:32
3,000 and this overall
32:36
is your sales. The difference between the two is your
32:40
profits. Everybody try and drive this yourself.
32:50
Commit mistakes. Learn. That's how we become better.
32:54
Speak to the person sitting next to you. Nudge, ask me. Chat GBD, anybody.
32:59
So yeah. So
33:13
no. So supplier is from whom I buy. Customer is the one to whom I sell.
33:20
So the business have bought the goods from a supplier.
33:25
Goods for shares. Yeah. Yeah. Goods are the
33:29
So the first transaction you're buying the goods for 10,000
33:33
from the suppliers but you're making the payment to them. So there is nothing
33:37
credit no credit in it is zero.
33:45
Everybody this time we are increasing the number of transactions and the
33:48
dimension as well. some funding raised, some assets being spent.
33:58
Then say I buy 10,000 worth of goods from a supplier.
34:09
In that case, you're saying that the goods you have bought but you did not
34:13
pay for it. people. You are not an accountant. Don't
35:49
try to be one. You are a business person. A business has to know the game.
35:56
It's not just the coach who knows the tricks. It is also the player who has to
36:01
know it. And while the game is on, the player has to know that I'm doing well.
36:07
I'm not doing well. I need to step up. I'm exerting myself. Where is the cramp
36:12
coming in? You don't have a physio or coach all the time.
36:18
Commit mistakes. Don't be under pressure to get it right. Unless you speak up, we
36:23
won't get to know where the mistake is. Very good.
36:55
Mhm. Which question? The previous one or this
37:02
one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, you're
37:06
absolutely there. You made two sale transactions
37:10
to the customer. One, you sold goods worth 2,000. to another customer you
37:14
sold goods worth,000. So in total you made sale of goods worth
37:19
3,000. Yeah. Go ahead.
37:32
Yeah. Yeah. Wallets, wire transfers, payment interfaces,
37:37
anything held, you know, in liquid form. Absolutely right. So everybody cash does
37:42
not only mean cash bank does not mean only the bank it means everything that
37:46
behaves like what let's say uh in a country where cryptos are allowed as a
37:50
legal tender even crypto balances will appear as bank balances
37:56
you see the point so bank balance means the liquid currency that you have to buy
38:01
or sell anything tomorrow so in Indian context it will be Indian rupee in uh
38:07
Dubai it will be dirhams so on and so forth
38:10
and also the wire transfers and mobile wallets and PayPal wallets etc etc.
38:17
How many people could get to the bank balance? Right or wrong does not matter
38:22
today. Please, you have to get out of that shell. Nobody is here to judge you.
38:27
Absolutely no. Everybody, let's do the bank balance together. How much is the
38:32
number that you're getting by the way? So, so we have like 20,000 first,000
38:43
everything put together. Yeah. Right. Anything that behaves like cash
38:48
like 5,000 5,000
38:51
5,000 Okay. Any other? 15,000
38:54
15,000 14,200
38:57
14,200 13,200
39:00
13,200 We're talking about the bank balance. Yes. Bank or cash all put
39:04
together? Bank and cash put together. 16800600
39:11
14600. Okay. Which means that some Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead.
39:16
15800. Okay. Uh so let's just let's just go over the goods the transactions one
39:22
by one everybody. Transaction number one raising money
39:26
from equity investors 20,000. Okay. Money comes in the bank balance goes up.
39:32
Two you're purchasing machinery worth 5,000. That means money goes out
39:37
machinery comes in. Goods purchased on credit 10,000. Money
39:44
stays same. Stays same. Very good. It's a credit
39:46
transaction. Point number four, 40% of the goods
39:50
purchased sold on credit. So, let me just write the math. 40% of
39:57
so 4,000 plus profit 30%
40:05
you made a sale of 5200.
40:14
Correct. And then 20% of the goods purchase sold for 10% loss. So 2,000
40:25
how much loss? 10%.
40:31
These are the two sale transactions maybe to the same customer to a
40:34
different customer. How does it matter? And then 10% of the goods purchased were
40:38
sold. Oh no, they were not sold. Distributed as free samples. Oh no. uh
40:42
they got burned by fire. Is the last transaction an expense? Are you
40:48
consuming the goods? No. But then it smells like
40:53
Smells like fire. Yeah. Okay. Uh uh it smells like
40:57
loss brings us to an important point. Is loss same as expense?
41:03
Is loss same as expense? So when you go down during the lunch break spend 10
41:09
dirhams to buy a water bottle that is consumed money well utilized that's an
41:15
expense but when by chance somebody picks your pocket or you trip your
41:19
wallet or something happens you loses 10 dhams that loss is technically not going
41:25
to give you anything. So expense is is an outflow which does not give you any
41:30
gratification. Okay. uh that's a loss and technically expense is expense means
41:37
consumption there is something that you're consuming. So let's look at the
41:42
bank balance everybody. Very simple addition subtraction. 20,000 comes in.
41:49
5,000 goes out. No transaction. No transaction because
41:56
this one is on credit. Then 1,800 comes in or goes out.
42:03
Very good. The customer has paid me. And then goods go out but cash does not. So
42:09
here overall 16,800 is the bank balance you're left with
42:19
is the question how much is your loss? No. Is the question how much is your
42:23
goods? No. The question is how much is your bank balance? The key is always in
42:27
the question. Don't be in a hurry to answer. As an entrepreneur you have to
42:32
listen a lot. Are we together on that? So the question
42:36
here was somebody is interested to find out only my liquidity position. That
42:41
means how much is the bank balance or the cash balance I hold. They're not
42:46
interested in anything else right now together. Are we everybody? Okay. Can we
42:50
look at the inventory balance? Where is inventory coming? Inventory
42:54
going. Now here your focus is myopically on one element that is your inventory.
42:59
You're only focusing on your warehouse your goown. You're not focusing on your
43:03
bank accounts. So here focus on the go down. Is there any change in the go down
43:07
balance? You're raising money from equity. No. Is there any change in the
43:12
inventory balance in the go down? No. You're dealing with something else
43:14
machine not inventory. Is there any change in your inventory balance? Yes.
43:19
10,000 inventory goes up. Is there any change in the inventory
43:24
balance? Yes. 4,000 worth of inventory goes out.
43:31
Is there any change in the inventory balance? Yes. 2,000 worth of inventory
43:35
again goes out. 10% of the goods purchased were burned
43:41
by fire. Is there any change in the goods? Yes. 10% again goes out.
43:47
So you are left with 3,000 worth of inventory.
43:54
So investor is asking a question. How much of your money is blocked in
43:57
inventory? They're not asking about your bank balance. They're not asking about
44:00
anything else but just simply for you to tell them how much your inventory is.
44:05
Especially in industries where the fashion changes very frequently or let's
44:09
say it the cycles are very long inventory cycles. Investors are so
44:13
fanatic about the stock levels that you keep. They are okay with the stock out
44:18
but they're not okay with the slowmoving inventory. So inventory for product
44:22
firms especially is one of the very very important things. Right now what you did
44:26
is just to do some addition subtraction. Are we together on that? So while you
44:30
are arriving at everybody this 3,000 is your focus on money or is your focus is
44:35
on goods? Goods whether bought on money or on credit or burned by fire anyway
44:41
the focus is on goods. That is the myopic focus that I want everybody to
44:46
have while you're making these business parameters.
44:50
Are we together on that? Okay. Next. Is there any customer who has bought from
44:55
us and not paid but promised to pay? Yes. That becomes
45:03
my receivable 5200.
45:07
Straightforward. Is there any supplier from whom we have
45:12
purchased something but not paid? Is there a supplier like that? Where is
45:18
the supplier here? Oh, it's right. And how much are the goods that are due
45:26
people? Now see how funny it is. You know I'll tell you how funny this
45:30
business is. They have purchased goods worth how much? 10,000. They have used
45:36
or lost goods worth how much? 7,000. So that you're left with only
45:41
three. But you see entire payment is due to the supplier.
45:46
Now supplier payment is not dependent on how fast you consume your goods. It is
45:51
dependent on what is your terms and agreement with your suppliers. So how
45:56
many people have ordered from Domino's or Pizza Hut or anywhere. Okay. Now
46:00
let's say again decoding the transaction. The moment you know a bike
46:05
comes up uh they deliver you the pizza box and they are just standing. Imagine
46:11
you have to you're yet to pay. It's not an online payment. And then you're also
46:15
looking at his face. He's also looking at your face. And then you're like,
46:18
"What?" He's saying, "Payment." And you're like, "What payment? Let me have
46:24
it first." Do you think that person is going to wait for you to consume the
46:28
goods and then make the payment? Is that Do you think that's going to happen? No.
46:33
Consumption is your internal affair. Payment is a dealing with your business
46:37
associate. So here maybe the payment terms are um pay within 300 days. Who
46:43
knows who cares? But the consumption will happen according to your own you
46:48
know what my customers are saying etc etc are we together on that payment is
46:52
different consumption is different you have to understand these small small
46:55
nuances of businesses and I'm glad that term one here in Dubai is not based on
47:02
services but products firm so drop shipping essentially is a product
47:05
related you know job because product related businesses make you understand
47:09
business much better than service related businesses so I'm glad that the
47:14
first term is products So products may you have the inventory
47:17
you you see the central point the cerebral point of the whole thing. Okay.
47:21
All right. Now how many goods have you used or lost?
47:27
7,000. Here question number five is it asking about total goods lost or what is
47:33
the question asking? Focus on the question
47:37
only those goods which have been sold.
47:42
That's COGS. It is not to say give me a laundry list where all have goods gone.
47:47
No, it's only to say give me the goods which have been sold. So where are the
47:51
goods which have been sold? Here are the goods which have been sold.
47:56
You have sold goods transaction customer one and to customer two. That's it. Now
48:01
is COG is asking tell me the profitable ones only. No, it means goods sold means
48:06
goods sold whether some of them have sold for profit, some of them sold for
48:09
loss. How does it matter? So therefore cost of goods sold is 6,000.
48:17
Are we together? And how much is your total revenue by
48:20
the way coming from two customers? 7,000. Brilliant. So your total revenue
48:26
Oh, how much how much is the formula for profit? Oh, not a formula. Simple
48:31
expression. Revenue minus cost. So the revenue is 7,000 you said. And the cost
48:39
of goods sold you said is 6,000. So you think you have made a profit of,000.
48:45
Congratulations. But my god there is in addition to
48:51
expenses there is a loss as well. Where is the loss? 10% of the goods was burnt.
49:00
So therefore, oh my god, your profit becomes a zero.
49:08
people, you do so much hard work. You've raised money from equity, did everything
49:13
right, but just one casual mistake. You're leaving your goods unattended.
49:18
Somebody was paint painting and then smoking at the same time and then paint
49:22
caught fire and then the goods are burnt. Now, one thing is to say, so
49:26
what? Goods are burnt. We could have sold it. Okay, that's okay. But you see,
49:28
the point is that it has evaporated your profits.
49:32
entire hard work that you have done in pricing strategies, in marketing
49:36
strategies, in getting a website done is all gone because of one mistake. Goods
49:40
being burned by fire. Earning profit out of a business is like
49:45
getting a million things right at the same time. That's crucial. The point is
49:51
not, let's talk about Tesla Motors. The point is not that someday tires are good
49:56
but steering is bad. Some days steerings are good but seats are bad. Some days
50:00
seats are good but engines are bad. Some days batteries are good. Point is every
50:05
day everything has to be right then it becomes a good business.
50:11
So you know there are a lot of parts marketing sales distributions HR um
50:16
finance everything has to be right on all days that's a successful business.
50:22
So here business did two things very well. You see the this transaction was
50:26
superb. You are making a 30% markup. Well done. But that one good transaction
50:32
was undo by one average average like a lossmaking transaction and then the
50:37
final nail in the coffin was like the loss that you incurred. Are we together
50:40
on that everybody? Okay. All right. So the sales is like we done 7,000 profit
50:44
is also what we have done. So welcome to the main case for today
50:50
for which there is a template that has been given. Sure. Sure.
50:57
Everybody learning versus practice. The more you practice, the more comfortable
51:01
it becomes. That's it. There is no other way. I know.
51:07
How many people have learned driving on a simulator?
51:12
On a simulator. But then are you still driving on a
51:16
simulator or did you take a car on the road someday? Was it a different
51:21
experience? You can see a lot many variables coming. Some people some red
51:25
lights, some green lights, some underpasses, some over so on so forth.
51:28
Now all of that on the first day was so overwhelming. But today it has become
51:33
easy. That's only when you don't withdraw from the position. You continue
51:38
to press the pedal. Okay, everybody moving on.
51:42
All right. So you have a template. You can work on the template. You can work
51:45
on pen paper. We don't care. We want you to apply your business acumen, not your
51:50
accounting acumen. Please read the transactions. Eight transactions. Any
51:56
problem in any of the transaction, please highlight it. Now
52:01
only eight transactions. Just read the business. Well, accounting
52:53
is a profession of writing business's health. Reading is important. Therefore,
53:01
who is doing what? All the transactions are done by the
53:05
business. some funding, some investments, some
53:11
day-to-day jobs. We're just reading it. We're just
53:23
reading it. Any business uh contract which is not clear, uh just just read
53:28
through it. Just read through it. Which ones?
53:43
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Unless something says it is payment is due, we
53:48
always assume the payments are done. Just make sure that you read the
54:13
business transaction. Well, people remember my target was for you to have a
54:17
conversation with somebody else. You don't calculate profit. I understand it
54:22
is okay. But you say, "Oh, I can't understand business. That's not okay for
54:26
me." We will do same cases like 10 days back
54:30
to back. There's no point on moving ahead unless we are comfortable with it.
54:38
How many people have reached reading till here? Point number eight. Okay,
54:43
good. Two more minutes for everybody to come here.
55:04
How many people want to be an entrepreneur or have that spirit? Which
55:08
means you're not afraid afraid to commit mistakes, right? Let us all have some
55:13
numbers on the board. Some numbers right or wrong, it does not matter. Are we
55:18
together? This is not an assessment. But before you start doing, I have a few
55:22
questions. How much is the inventory you are left
55:28
with? How much is the inventory that you are
55:34
left with? Now, this is a business question. This
55:40
is not an accounting question. How much inventory are you left with?
55:49
You're afraid. You're having a fear of getting judged. You know the answer at
55:54
least I can read the eyes. You know the answer but you're hesitating. How much
55:58
is the inventory? 450.
56:00
Okay. How much is the inventory you are left with?
56:04
Zero. Zero. Why zero?
56:09
Because this is drop shipping number one. Okay. No but but that's a smart
56:13
one. That's a smart one. However, think about it. Was a transaction. You get an
56:17
order from the customer and what did you do? You ask the supplier to deliver it
56:23
to the customer. Has the goods been delivered to the customer?
56:27
Yeah, I purchased some supplies agreed, etc., etc., etc. Yeah. Did the goods
56:32
come to your place? No. Did you bring the goods in your books? No. Inventory
56:36
zero. Next question. How many customer orders did you get?
56:41
Three. Very good. Are all of same value? No. In some you will make profit, in
56:46
some you will not make profit. That's okay. That's part of business. Part of
56:50
life are we together? Okay. How much is the funding in total that you have
56:53
raised? How much is the total funding you have
56:57
raised? Very good. Thousand blue box. You see debt versus equity.
57:02
Initially out of that 1,000, how much is the upfront investments that you're
57:07
doing in some assets? So you're buying let's say a camera 200.
57:14
And are you developing a website this time?
57:18
What is this white labeling? No, this is not an accounting term.
57:24
Don't look at me like that. This is a marketing term. What is white labeling?
57:29
Oh, say more about it. What is white labeling goods?
57:34
It's your own good. So, imagine let's say my my name is my
57:43
name of my business is Nike. Okay. Nike sells a lot of t-shirts. Do you think
57:47
Nike produces all of that themselves? No. They have like some shops in Vietnam
57:53
and Thailand and Sri Lanka and India and you know all those places where the
57:56
labor is lower, the material cost is low and therefore they ask them to produce
58:01
and then put their logo on it. So to the world it will appear as if it's a Nike
58:06
product. But in reality the back end you knows that it was not produced in-house.
58:12
Why didn't Nike buy the t-shirts themselves? Somebody asked them a
58:15
question, they said, "Who's going to set up plant and machinery? Who's going to
58:18
hire?" So there's so much, you know, hassle to do that. I am paying the
58:22
supplier. He's doing everything for me and I'm putting my label on it. That's
58:25
it. You white label websites also. Uh you can develop your own websites, you
58:30
know, Drupal, etc., etc. You can write your own codes, have your own
58:33
everything, domain name purchase or there are a lot of software as services,
58:37
SAS, there are a lot of platforms as a services. So they have those demo codes
58:42
written. They will give you the sub, you know, take the subscription from you,
58:45
let's say for a year. Let's say for $80 a year. And then what will they give
58:50
you? They will give you some kind of a website on which you can put your white
58:54
label. So how does a website is named? www.tetar.com.
59:01
Now this website appears as if it is tetar but at the back end a customer
59:06
will never find out whether it's widleabeled or developed from the
59:11
scratch by Teta. So white labeling is like renting. White labeling saves the
59:16
time of developing all everything themselves. So imagine Nike if they have
59:20
to set up a factory they'll take at least 6 7 months but they can put an
59:24
order to Vietnamese factory and then put a white label the goods are there in
59:28
America in the next 15 days. White labeling saves time and saves a lot of
59:33
cost. That's what perhaps this business is doing people. So this is not an
59:36
accounting discussion we had for last 5 minutes. This is business transaction
59:39
and the clearer you are on that the easier your accounting is going to
59:42
become. Are you with me on that? So your endeavor in term one not only has to be
59:46
in learning drop shipping only you have to learn different models of doing
59:50
business different ways of interacting with your different associates. Okay.
59:55
All right. So far so good everybody. Who is going to pay to the logistics person?
1:00:03
Who is going to pay to the logistics person? The supplier.
1:00:07
The supplier this time. Very good. What is the supplier saying?
1:00:14
That means this 450 the price of the goods. It does not only include the
1:00:21
basic goods but also includes the logistic service. Is that a fair point?
1:00:27
Are you with me on that? So just think about it. If we order pizza from Pizza
1:00:32
Hut but using Karim's service, right? So pizza is 30 dirhams and Kharim takes 5
1:00:39
Dhams more. So the landed cost of pizza to me is 35 DS. What if Domino's says or
1:00:46
Pizza Hut says that don't hire Karim and Uber etc. I will get it delivered at
1:00:50
your doorstep this time. How much do you think that Domino's or Pizza Hut is
1:00:55
going to charge? Same 30. No, they will add the cost of logistics also on it.
1:01:00
The landed cost to the customer will remain the same. Who is doing what does
1:01:04
not really matter. So this time logistics is not the person hired by me.
1:01:08
Logistics is a person hired by the supplier. I have to just pay the single
1:01:12
bundled common amount to the supplier. Are we together on that everybody? Okay.
1:01:16
Now you have understood business. Well, this is the time where you start making
1:01:19
the bank balance. Go to the template and get me the bank balance.
1:01:26
You have 5 minutes to get the bank balance. Maybe it should take you just 2
1:01:32
minutes. Just write inflows and outflows. Yeah.
1:01:35
2,900 is the first answer. 2,200 is the second.
1:01:40
It's like making after one year. You're making after one year.
1:01:44
Okay. Yeah. Um, so yeah, correct. So I think
1:01:47
that should have been more clearer. Oxia LLC
1:01:51
started a drop shipping business and made the following transactions during
1:01:56
the year. That means one full year one full year has passed and now you are
1:02:02
taking stock of things as to what did I gain, what did I lose, how much is my
1:02:06
inventory balance and stuff. How much is your bank balance?
1:02:34
This is a template. You can work on pen, paper. It's absolutely okay.
1:02:40
Oh, show the question. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
1:02:57
Everybody now your focus has to be only on the bank balance nothing else. Any
1:03:02
transaction you see bank or cash coming in or going out just write it as inflows
1:03:07
and outflows. Yeah, it's an expense.
1:03:42
So, white labeling is like a renting expense.
1:04:19
I don't know. Um, yeah. So in one of the sections they
1:04:27
said uh go through the website rather than the LMS something like that
1:04:34
there's something that they did and then it started properly. So maybe you can
1:04:38
just check anybody with the bank balance you simply have to do addition
1:04:43
subtraction although we still have 3 minutes no rush whatsoever.
1:04:48
How much? 2,800.
1:04:51
28 2820
1:04:55
2920 2520
1:05:00
2780 2780 Very good.
1:05:02
28 28
1:05:05
You were 2 400 a while ago. But that's okay. One can
1:05:10
always improve. Hasha, how much?
1:05:15
2930. So you're focusing on stock or bank?
1:05:21
Only the bank right now. Only the bank right now. Okay. Two more minutes.
1:05:25
Everybody just write inflows and outflows.
1:05:38
Yeah, they have been paid. Good point. All these goods 450 have been paid
1:05:43
because supplier this time was asking for immediate payment.
1:05:47
All the goods have been paid this time. 2820
1:05:52
2820 2900 Okay.
1:05:56
282 2820 2820 seems to be
1:06:02
the most frequent answer. Okay everybody let's see
1:06:14
the correct one indeed is 2820 just figure out where did you go wrong
1:06:23
which is absolutely okay this is the space to mistake me safe space
1:06:27
absolutely you're raising money initially
1:06:36
from promoters in bank. Then you bought a camera.
1:06:40
You did not develop the website but you rent it out. That's okay. 80 will go
1:06:43
out. Tax consultant's invoice was how much?
1:06:49
70. Very good. But you end up paying how much?
1:06:52
100. So what is the question right now? The bank balance. What is important?
1:06:57
Actual payments. Therefore entire 100 will show up. Influencer
1:07:02
250. Ah, there is no marketing agency here. Did we miss writing marketing
1:07:07
agency? What was the deal with marketing agency?
1:07:12
Oh, we missed it. We missed it. I think marketing is such an important element.
1:07:20
But because the payment is still due, therefore it will not come in. People
1:07:26
please stop having fear of missing out the FOMO. Stop feeling so motherly
1:07:30
about, oh, everything needs to be included. you know how bad some
1:07:33
absolutely look at the question and then finally the answer
1:07:37
anything if not in cash doesn't matter how important it is it will not be part
1:07:41
of cash flow statement are we together on that everybody you have 60 seconds to
1:07:47
correct your answers to 2820 I hope you are on excel
1:08:07
So those who were getting a different number what was the primary reason for a
1:08:11
difference in the the website
1:08:16
marketing agency okay the payment was due so it won't come here
1:08:22
marketing tax very good uh tax consult consultant. Why
1:08:28
is it 100 and not 70? Somebody answer why the tax consultant is 100 and not 70
1:08:36
because that's what was paid. The payment due was 70. Understood? Because
1:08:40
he has worked for me for 70 but I've actually ended up paying. So this bank
1:08:45
statement is answer to a question of the reality of cash inflow and outflow.
1:08:52
People the key is always in the question. Nobody's asking you to figure
1:08:56
out where does the business stand, the position. Nobody's asking about how is
1:09:01
the stock balance. Nobody's asking about how good the profitability. Somebody's
1:09:05
asking a simple question. How much is the bank balance I'm left with? That's
1:09:09
it. Okay. Once you have the bank balance with you, I want you to start focusing
1:09:13
on the incomes and expenses. Incomes is when you deal with your customers.
1:09:18
Expenses are consumptions on the way. income when you deal with your customer.
1:09:38
Raising money from equity or debt, is that your income?
1:09:43
That's the funding. You're not dealing with your customer. You're dealing with
1:09:46
your investors. The only thing we're really dealing with
1:10:10
customers is like the money that comes in and the money that goes out like for
1:10:15
the orders isn't it like where are we dealing with customers? I mean the
1:10:20
marketing cost all this kind of stuff this not the customer fair point. So
1:10:25
dealing with customer I mean um that you're actually transacting with the
1:10:29
customer. In marketing you are indirectly engaging with them in order
1:10:33
to impress them but you're directly engaging meaning that you're selling
1:10:36
goods to them. So whenever you're selling goods or services to the
1:10:40
customer that's your revenue right here in this classroom teter is
1:10:44
directly selling their services to you all of you that's sales for them. Yeah.
1:10:49
So that's your income. So everybody under which of these steps
1:10:56
is there an income for the business? Only one income
1:11:03
seven. And thank God there were more than one
1:11:07
orders. Total revenue is equal to you have 1300 + 700 + 900 in total
1:11:19
2900. That's the total value of services
1:11:24
delivered or goods delivered. Have they been paid in cash? Thank God.
1:11:29
That's a you know uh second good news. But the different expenses
1:11:39
are too many. Let us see where are the expenses?
1:11:48
Where do you see the expenses? Is there an expense in raising money from equity
1:11:53
and debt? No. Is there an expense in using the camera?
1:11:59
Yes. Website? Yes. Marketing agency?
1:12:07
Yes. Oh, but you have not paid for it. But still an expense. Why?
1:12:14
You have to pay. Have to pay. But why do you have to pay?
1:12:17
Consume the services is the answer because you have consumed the services
1:12:21
of the marketing agency whether paid or not doesn't matter. Yes ma'am you had a
1:12:24
point. You were saying something. Sorry I cut you short.
1:12:27
Yeah the same same point.
1:12:31
Okay. Tax consultant was paid 100. Yeah there
1:12:34
is an expense. Influencer there is an expense.
1:12:39
Is there an expense here? Yes.
1:12:43
And is there an expense here? Yes. So how much is the profit that you are
1:12:48
getting? 160
1:12:52
560. Okay. 1 480
1:12:55
1 63 1 630
1:12:58
1 1510 660
1:13:01
1 1660 Okay. All right. Quick question. How
1:13:06
much is the expense in relation to camera that you all have taken?
1:13:13
Right. 200 is the total value of the camera.
1:13:19
Correct. Is that camera going to be consumed fully in the current year?
1:13:25
No. That means it is it is good for how many years?
1:13:29
Four. Four. And this is you're making profits
1:13:32
only after 1 year. That means only 1/4th of it must have been consumed.
1:13:38
Which means how much is the usage charge of the camera? 50.
1:13:43
not 200 but yes payment is full 200 after all no doubt about that that's how
1:13:49
liquidity differs from profitability that's why those two things are so
1:13:53
different and each other so the correct answer is 1660
1:14:25
Yeah. One
1:14:33
660. Everybody this is the second dimension
1:14:42
of the health. How liquid business is 2820
1:14:48
I'm left with. But how profitable business is only 1,600.
1:14:55
Camera full 200 will hit my cash but only the 1/4 will hit my profits.
1:15:03
Marketing will hit my profits because I've consumed the service but will not
1:15:08
hit my cash. Those two are different dimensions. What
1:15:12
you consume versus what you pay. But but everybody I want everybody to please
1:15:17
focus here. Influencer is 250 in that list also and 250 in this list also. How
1:15:23
come there is so much similarity? When will the profitability and
1:15:27
liquidity be similar? When?
1:15:31
Exactly. When you pay exactly for what you consume. That means your liquid your
1:15:36
influencer has been paid 250 and he has delivered the services also worth
1:15:41
exactly 250 then the both statement will talk the same tune but that's not a
1:15:46
guarantee always look at tetar they have been consuming my service so I am
1:15:51
entering in tetar's in income statement as a cost but I am not figuring out as
1:15:59
an outflow because they have not yet made the payment to me
1:16:03
on the other And you guys are already in the cash flow collection from customers.
1:16:09
You've paid the fees, right? But have they delivered full service to you? No.
1:16:14
Therefore, you guys are not an income statement of Teta.
1:16:18
Think about it. It's all about the business transactions
1:16:22
and how what you do with your success. Are we together on that everybody? Any
1:16:25
confusion so far? Okay. Now, last five minutes. Are we do we have the energy
1:16:30
for last five minutes? Okay. All said and done. All said and done.
1:16:44
What are the obligations the business have to be paid to anybody?
1:16:50
What are the obligations? Bank loan. Very good.
1:16:55
Oh, website is already paid. 80 every year. So, there is one bank
1:16:59
loan. Marketing.
1:17:00
Marketing. Very good. And interest. Very good. Anything else which is due for
1:17:05
payment? No, only these three. Can you sum total
1:17:09
these three? 740. 740 is the total obligation.
1:17:14
Correct. These are the only three things which are due.
1:17:18
Next, what are the total resources that you are left with that you can use
1:17:24
tomorrow? What has happened has happened. What has used been used? What
1:17:27
would you use tomorrow? Camera.
1:17:30
Camera. Tax consultant card once $30 and
1:17:36
cash balance. Cash balance.
1:17:39
Are we together? These are the three things which you can use tomorrow. Can
1:17:43
somebody total these three things? How much?
1:17:46
3,000. 3,000. Okay.
1:17:56
Correct. And the camera is not a brand new camera
1:18:00
that you have now. The camera is actually one year old camera. So you
1:18:05
might have paid 200 for it, but that's worth only 150 at the end of the year.
1:18:12
And may I ask may I ask what is the point in time that you're
1:18:17
making this list? At the beginning of the year or the end
1:18:21
of the year? End of the year. End of the year. Okay. So at the end of the day
1:18:26
you're telling the world that there are resources that I have 3,000 and there
1:18:29
are obligations that I have is 740. So far so good. How many people have
1:18:34
confusion in 740 and 3,000? If you have reached till here it's well
1:18:39
done. It is very very well done people. I'll give you the solution. Don't waste
1:18:43
your time in making a copy paste. In case you want to do you have 30 seconds
1:18:46
to do that and then I want you to wear a common sense hat.
1:19:04
10 more seconds. Although I can share this right away. You have already taken
1:19:09
pictures. So that's okay. Uh I can share it in the in the LMS.
1:19:15
Yeah, I suppose read. But then again the problem is that there are too many
1:19:18
versions coming from me and then it becomes so hodgepodge. That's the only
1:19:22
reason otherwise it's there. It's for you.
1:19:37
Okay, we'll figure out. We'll figure out. Everybody, I just want you to pick
1:19:40
up a a phone phone and open a calculator app. Please open a calculator app on
1:19:47
phone. Go to the calculator app on your
1:19:53
handset. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to ask a few questions. You pick up the number
1:19:58
from the solution and then you punch in the numbers. Okay. My first question is
1:20:03
how much is the total resources the business owns?
1:20:10
What number are you going to pick up? The total resources the business
1:20:13
owns,000. 3,000. And then there are multiple of
1:20:16
them. No, there is some bank, some this and some that etc. total 3,000. Punch in
1:20:20
3,000. Next question that I have out of these,
1:20:25
how many belongs to outsiders? Meaning the business is yet to make the payment
1:20:31
to them. You're talking about obligations, right?
1:20:35
Oh, that is obligation. Some amount that the business owes to somebody else. Can
1:20:39
you subtract 2260? What is this 2260? Is it not? The
1:20:45
resources remaining in the business after paying to outsiders.
1:20:50
That is equity. That is owner's money in the business. The total money in the
1:20:56
business subtract outsiders money. Whatever remains is owner's money in the
1:21:00
business. Are you with me on that? So if somebody asks you a question, all said
1:21:04
and done, it's okay. How much is owner's money in the game? You say, "Oh, hang
1:21:07
on, hang on." Now you are answering this question. You see, you picked up 3,000,
1:21:10
you picked up 740. Meaning how funny it is. You're valuing equity by not looking
1:21:15
at equity, but by somebody and somebody else. So you're looking at everybody
1:21:19
3,000 and you're looking at outsiders 740 and you're saying oh whatever left
1:21:25
must be theirs. But you didn't look at them at all. But that's okay if there
1:21:29
are only two people in the game. Equity and outsiders. We can do this by way of
1:21:32
exclusion. Total minus them must be for me. Okay. That's one way to get equity's
1:21:38
worth. Equity was getting a major form of no no please look at me. Please look
1:21:42
at me. I'm I'm getting left out. And okay fine. All clear. All clear on your
1:21:47
screens. Is is it all clear on your screens everybody? Equity is we now are
1:21:52
interviewing equity. How much did you contribute in the business at the
1:21:57
beginning of the year? What number are you going to pick up?
1:22:00
600. That's it. And how much did business generate for you during the
1:22:07
year? What number are we referring to?
1:22:11
That is the profit. This profit of 160 have employees being paid
1:22:18
has consultant being paid have websites being paid have all camera usage charges
1:22:23
being taken off have bank interest been taken off now this 1660 belongs to whom
1:22:30
there's only one stakeholder has not been paid for the service the owner that
1:22:34
means remember the funding with equity was that you know thank you very much
1:22:37
equity I can't give you anything you become my owner ownership gets you
1:22:41
access to two things number one decision rights you can take decisions about the
1:22:45
firm and second residual profits. The residual profits belong to equity. So
1:22:50
how much was contributed by equity initially? 600. How much did business
1:22:56
generate for equity? 1660. Can you add the two?
1:23:04
You still get 2260 which is equity is money in the game. So this is your
1:23:10
valuing equity by looking at equity in both the cases the answer obviously have
1:23:15
to be the same because the question was the same right from point A you have to
1:23:19
go to point B there are two ways of going there but point is you're going to
1:23:22
reach the same point the destination is owner's money in the game so formula one
1:23:28
I don't call it formula I call it approach approach one look at everybody
1:23:32
else and let equity be the remainder total miners outsiders second approach
1:23:38
Ask them initial money plus the profits that you are accumulated that's what is
1:23:45
are we together on that everybody so in the interest of time we stop here we can
1:23:49
do if and then analysis maybe the next time we meet tomorrow is that okay
1:23:53
everybody so uh tomorrow we are going to take a deep dive on income statement on
1:23:58
the LMS there is one video which has been uploaded for session five although
1:24:02
technically that is session six please look at the video uploaded for session
1:24:06
five on income statement.

How can the cash flow statement help you spot trouble early? How do you categorise different cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activ
23/09/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:04
Still 10 seconds to go. That is wonderful. That is wonderful.
0:20
It would have been a perfect house but for one.
0:25
Incredible. Let's go.
1:01
Ah that's I think I praised too soon to enough
1:08
getting cash from the customers before delivering the order that's an
1:12
obligation on your head. Now you are an obligation either to deliver the goods
1:16
or to return the money. It's not more equity. More equity means
1:24
more profit. Profit comes up only when you deliver your jobs. But you haven't
1:28
done it. It's just the liquidity has gone up, profitability has not
1:32
on an income statement. There is for sure more profit.
1:34
Yeah. But this is not going to go anywhere in the income statement.
1:39
That's what we will zoom in. Income is not what you receive. Income is what you
1:43
deliver, what the job that you do. So that's the difference between profit
1:47
balance and the cash balance. Today we will have some some cases just to
1:52
explain that. But this is what you know yesterday also we had kind of made this
1:55
point pretty clear that in case somebody is receiving faster money more money
2:00
sooner money that's not that does not mean that they are getting more profits
2:06
income means you're doing your job on the ground
2:09
what's the weightage of these cahoots to overall grade
2:13
two what's the weightage of these cahoots to
2:15
our overall grade 20% roughly
2:19
all worth 20% of our grade Profit is something else. Cash is
2:34
something else. That's well done.
2:59
We will all the above will make sure that your profit and cash balances don't
3:04
match. So in case you are incurring an expense but not paying for it. So
3:09
because of expense profits will go down but cash will not. Blue raising money
3:14
from investors your cash will go up but your expenses and income will not. So
3:18
profit no impact. uh green customer paying later than the delivery date.
3:23
That's all right. You've done your job. Your incomes have been booked. It's just
3:26
that the liquidity has not you know come in. So profits will go up but liquidity
3:31
will not. That's the differentiation in your head that you have to be all the
3:34
time very very clear. But I'm not saying that liquidity and profitability will
3:40
never match. What I'm saying is in some cases it will. For example during
3:45
lunchtime what will happen? uh somebody will go and buy let's say um hot
3:49
chocolate for three dirhams. Think from a seller's point of view. What is he
3:53
supposed to do under the contract to deliver the hot chocolate to you? And
3:56
when do you make the payment? At the very moment. So at that very moment that
4:03
shopkeepers sale also happens and collection also happens. That means in
4:08
this case the liquidity and the profitability will exactly be the same.
4:13
However, in many cases, look at me. I have been delivering the service for a
4:18
long time, but profitability therefore is going up. But liquidity will come in
4:23
November when I will raise the bill and Tetra will make the payment for me. Are
4:26
you with me on that? For all of you, you have paid the fees, cash goes down,
4:32
liquidity goes down, but you're incurring an expense day by day as you
4:37
are consuming the services of Tata. So what you do on the ground is over a
4:43
period of time. Liquidity is like a contractual thing. When do I when are
4:47
you supposed to pay to Okay. Yes. I was going to say if these were 20% of
4:52
our grade um and like at my old school 20% of our grade would be like midterm
4:57
exam moving forward we should have increased time for these.
5:01
These are simpler questions simpler questions and it is
5:06
20% of our grade. So maybe yeah I I think that's okay 20% is not a big deal
5:11
number one number two these are very very very simple questions no numerical
5:15
nothing plus I have not made cahoot for all the sessions in advance yesterday's
5:21
session after that happened I sat down at 5:00 p.m. looked at the key points
5:25
that came up and then we make the cahoot. So it's very very customized
5:29
that way. There is no cahoot prepared for tomorrow. Let today's session go in.
5:33
Let the main key points of argument, discussion, debate, understanding come
5:37
up and those five key points will be tested tomorrow. So it's not really like
5:42
um like a two too too serious a job like somebody's doing like a case analysis
5:47
kind of a thing. I think 20% is okay. How much what are other evaluations? Uh,
5:53
one is the endm reflection. Um, I can share the grading. I think
5:57
it's 30 30% is one and 50% is the other. I can share the grading. No problem.
6:03
Yeah. Let's go. Next. This is completely based on yesterday's
6:41
camera. You bought the camera in the yesterday's case for how much?
6:46
200. Very good. And you consumed it. The life was 4 years. You consumed it only
6:51
by 1/4. So your usage cost was only 50. So the 200 reduces your liquidity by
6:58
200. Your liquidity goes down. The bank balance goes down by 200. But your
7:02
profitability goes down only by the usage element which is just 50. So that
7:07
means liquidity goes down more. Liquidity is lower compared to the
7:11
profitability. Are you with me on that? So um the
7:16
yesterday's example 200 was the worth of the camera that you purchased and 50 is
7:21
the usage cost per year. Okay 50 50 54 times is going to be the usage cost. Now
7:26
in the year that you're purchasing your liquidity will go down by how much?
7:31
200 but your profitability will not go down by 200 but only by 50 because of
7:37
the usage cost. Only when you consume full camera in the
7:42
first year itself is where liquidity and profitability be same people there has
7:46
to be as an entrepreneur you have to appreciate that profitability is not
7:50
cash flow profitability is what do you do on the ground that difference
7:55
obviously it's going to take a while it's very natural confusion um and
7:59
that's why we are you know checking again and again on this point so that
8:02
come tomorrow maybe you might forget the class but you might remember this
8:06
question that's again an idea to rein emphasize on the important points. Okay,
8:11
let's go. Let's see who stands where.
8:27
So, very good. Uh, Anun, where is Anon? Well done,
8:33
Anun. Well done. Uh, 2923. Fantastic. And we have 29053.
8:39
Well done. And so good job done. So let's get started. Can we have more
8:45
light in the room? I think this is too much. It's too much.
8:52
A little less. Yeah, I think this much.
9:07
Yeah, I think. Okay, everybody, there is one main case
9:26
which is relatively confusing basis the other section that we ran that in. Um
9:30
here are the some of the questions that I want you to take a look at. In case
9:34
anybody asks question like these or you have a confusion related to your
9:39
venture, just read through these five points.
10:27
Do you find anywhere? where word liquidity or cash or the bank balance is
10:33
written? Do you find anywhere debt versus equity
10:37
debate being written? Do you find anywhere funding written? Do you find
10:42
anywhere investments written? These are the questions income statement
10:47
cannot handle people. Any financial statement that we today is a day for
10:52
income statement. No financial statement will be able to capture all dimensions
10:56
of the health. to know the limitation is very very important. So as a doctor if
11:01
some patient complains in a muscle directing them to go for an X-ray is a
11:05
futile exercise. You have to look at the right door to knock on. So in case
11:11
somebody wants to know about the margins, somebody wants to know about
11:13
the efficiency, somebody wants to know about the operational profits, somebody
11:17
wants to know about the earning for the shareholders, those kind of profit
11:21
related, work related, performance related jobs is what the medical report
11:26
called as income statement will be able to handle. Are we together on that?
11:30
Okay. Typically you have three kind of income. So far we have done just one
11:33
income. For Teta, what is the income? For Teta, which activity is considered
11:38
as an income? the fees from the student. So the customer is what generates the
11:43
income. Are we together on that? But what would you call this? Yesterday I
11:48
saw a very big basket of used papers, some printouts being taken for
11:54
something, some handouts, some old cases, so on so forth. For the last 2
11:58
weeks, they were being sold out to a scrap dealer and the scrap dealer paid
12:02
them 100 dirhams. Now the 100 dirham is very very low in comparison to the fees
12:08
that all of you pay. What is that 100 dirham as an activity
12:12
for teta? Selling scrap is what kind of an
12:18
activity? That is also an income. But is that a
12:22
main income? No. Welcome to point number two. There are some incomes which are
12:26
other incomes not part of your main job but nonetheless it is yours. But tell me
12:32
is this remember operating, investing, financing. Operating is a day-to-day
12:35
job. Investing is related to long-term assets and financing was related to
12:43
some things that you can't afford to miss. Financing
12:46
debt and equity. Brilliant. Capital structure. Okay. Scrap sales. Is it
12:51
operating, investing or financing? Why operating? Good answer.
12:56
It's like it's your day-to-day job. You see, it's
13:01
your day-to-day job. newspapers. Let's say in our households, let's say some uh
13:05
people have a habit of getting hard copy magazines, hard copy brochures, hard
13:08
copy some things and then after a while you got to just scrap it away and the
13:11
scrapier in case they pay you like peanuts. That peanut is still some
13:15
income. That's not your main job, but still nonetheless it is something. Are
13:18
you with me on that? That's point number two here. But I'll tell you one more
13:22
example in context of Teta. Teta, this is the second year of
13:26
operations. Last year they generated hypothetically $50,000 of surplus
13:33
okay out of the students collection and payment to the faculties and payment of
13:36
rent there was a surplus generated last year of 50,000 USD they asked the owner
13:42
do you want it back in your pocket owner said no let let the business have it
13:47
then they checked internally does tetar need to invest this money somewhere uh
13:53
they realized no tetra does not want to invest this money also anywhere
13:57
Then this 50,000 they parked it in mutual funds.
14:01
The mutual funds generated a fantastic return let us say of 10,000 USD. This
14:07
10,000 USD which tar has earned tetar has generated is what kind of income
14:14
is this the main job for tetar? Is tetar an investment firm? No. Is this related
14:20
to day-to-day jobs that teta does? No. This income is other income,
14:26
nonoperational income. I am not disowning this income any I'm
14:32
not saying this is not mine. I'm not saying I will not show it in the income
14:35
statement. All three of them will come in the income statement. All three of
14:38
them are mine. It's just that they are of different value. They are of
14:42
different importance to me. My main focus always as tet is to collect as
14:47
much money from the students. That's what my primary customer is. That's what
14:50
Nvidia does. That's what Amazon does. But I'm not really against earning a two
14:56
and a three as well. Okay, everybody, let's move on. Look at the question on
15:00
the board. Look at the question on the board.
15:07
Question is not how much. Question is when. I'll take an example. I am the
15:15
business and Tetar is my customer. Correct?
15:18
Tetar called me up in the month of May to check if I'm available in the month
15:23
of September and October for these classes and I said yeah over phone this
15:27
is happening in the month of May. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm I'll be available. No
15:30
problem. It'll I'll be happy to come. In the month of June, they send me an
15:33
agreement, a contract. In the month of July, I signed the agreement and shipped
15:39
it back. In the month of August, they paid 10,000 USD as token amount just to
15:46
block the time and calendar and everything. In the month of September,
15:50
the classes began. This is the month we are in. In the month of October, classes
15:55
will end. and in the month of November I will get
15:58
the money. A business dealing with a customer has six monthly interaction.
16:05
The question that I'm asking all of you is
16:09
when should I book the revenue that I make from Teta 80our contract. Let us
16:14
say X per hour 80X is the quantum. Question is not on how much is the
16:21
income I should book. Question is when should I book? Are we together? In my
16:27
example, when do you think I should book?
16:30
When I sign the contract. Okay. November.
16:34
November. When I get the money and when should I book the income?
16:41
When I'm working. Let's say through September through October. You see
16:45
that's the debate. That's the confusion. When
16:49
answer is ask that business what are you supposed to do under the contract
16:58
provide the services okay when is that job over
17:03
when is the job of providing service over
17:07
October that's the time where you book the income
17:11
whatever you are supposed to do under the contract you do that you book your
17:16
income Okay, case number one. You ordered some shoes from adidas.com.
17:23
This is not a showroom that you go to. This is an online website.
17:29
COOD stands for cash on delivery.
17:34
D1 D2 are the dates on which these things happen.
17:40
The question is when should Adidas book the income from this order of customer?
18:01
might not have anything might not have happened at D4. You see the point? Let's
18:05
say in my case also nothing happened in let's say in the month of April. Okay.
18:10
So when will I book his revenue? What is IDA supposed to do under the contract?
18:17
Get more transactional everybody. Now you are hands-on entrepreneurs. Get more
18:21
hands-on. What is Adidas supposed to do under the contract?
18:25
Deliver the goods. Obviously as part of the whole thing I
18:30
have to receive the money as well. But that's not my main job. My main job is
18:32
what did the customer order you to do? To deliver the goods. Okay. Therefore,
18:37
can Adidas book its revenue at D3? Have the goods been delivered?
18:43
No. In spite of the fact that Adidas says my job is over this is a third
18:47
party logistics provider now it is his responsibility so on so forth that's
18:51
what I supposed to do but was with the customer the logistics provider was also
18:56
not the appointed by the customer you are responsible for everything whether
19:00
you do it in house whether you outsource whether you do whatever so the book the
19:05
revenue only when the goods are delivered which is at D5 whether the
19:08
money is received at D5 cood or the money is received at D1 money received
19:14
is no test for booking the income and we have done it yesterday. In fact, one of
19:18
the cahoot questions was also in case you happen to receive the money before
19:23
delivering the goods to the customer, what does that become?
19:27
A liability. So in case the customer already pays at D1, it is not an income.
19:33
It is actually a liability for 5 days. Only when you deliver the goods, you
19:38
say, "Thank God my obligations are over." Yes. So you're saying even if D1
19:42
we receive cash that's it
19:44
still still the income can't be booked the
19:46
bank balance obviously will go up so that's again something where your
19:50
liquidity and profitability will see a difference
19:52
so is income statement would just show up as cash and then on the liability
19:56
show no no no in income statement you never
19:58
show some anything as cash in the bank statement you show that as cash receipt
20:02
from customers and in the liability you show advance from customers
20:07
okay there is no adjustment that will happen in the income statement
20:11
Next, drop shipping. Question remains when? Question remains
20:17
when Question number one, who all will book
21:18
their revenues? First of all, who all are service providers in this whole
21:22
chain? Question or an answer?
21:25
Everyone except the seller. I mean, everyone except the customer.
21:28
So, name them. Name them. Who all are there? provider,
21:32
seller, logistics provider, and and the business, the drop shipper. Fair
21:35
point. When will the logistics provider book their income?
21:40
Let's say they charge $70 for delivery. When will the $70 come as their income?
21:45
When they finish their job, what is the job
21:48
that a logistics provider has to do? Very good. Deliver the goods. Delivery
21:53
happened on day eight. But hey, what are you saying? D8. Who pays cash to whom?
22:01
Customer. Customer pays. Very good. Customer pays
22:03
cash to D.
22:06
Business. Very good. When does a logistics guy get the money?
22:10
D11. That means between these two, D8 is where your profits will go up. Money
22:16
will not come in. That is called as a credit sale. You deliver your job but
22:21
the customer says I will pay. Don't worry. That means customer has given you
22:25
not cash but what promise. Brilliant. That's a credit sale. Okay.
22:32
At D11 the customer who is the customer for
22:36
logistics fellow the business. Brilliant. This is an
22:40
understanding that we need from all of you. The final customer is the consumer
22:44
who's going to wear the shoes. But there are a lot of people. So for example my
22:48
customer very frankly don't feel bad is not you.
22:53
My customer is whom? That's the point. You are the beneficiary of my service,
22:58
but you are not the customer for my service. Are you with me on that? So
23:02
those who want to take up marketing later on, etc., etc. There's some
23:05
difference between customer versus consumer.
23:08
You all are consumers. Very good. You're consuming
23:11
the service. But who is buying my service? Teta. So that understanding has
23:15
to be very very clear. So the logistics person is appointed by the drop shipper.
23:19
When did drop shipper pay the money to the logistics guy? at D11. So the bank
23:24
balance of the logistics fellow at D11 will see going up. But when was the job
23:30
over for logistics fellow? D8. That's when the profits will go up. It's a
23:34
credit sale for the logistics guy. Are you with me on that? Okay, you're doing
23:37
good job. Uh how about the how about the seller? What is the seller supposed to
23:42
do under the contract? Yeah.
23:46
Receive money. No, no, no, no, no, no.
23:50
Very good. Very good. What is the role of a seller? You as a drop shipper call
23:55
up the seller that you know logistics fellow will pick it up from you. What is
23:58
the role of that seller then? It's only to hand over to the logistics fellow.
24:02
That's it. Whether the goods are delivered, not delivered, the goods are
24:06
lost. It's not the seller's problem anymore. And therefore, when should a
24:10
seller book their revenue? When should the seller book their
24:14
revenue? D4 itself. Different people in the same value chain will book the
24:20
revenue. the moment their job gets over. As simple as that. Nobody's going to
24:24
wait for the final delivery of the goods to happen. For example, I am just
24:28
handling one course for you. No, I'm not going to wait for 4 years for your
24:32
entire program to get over to book my revenue. My job gets over in the month
24:36
of October. I will book the revenue then. End of story. Everybody whosoever
24:40
is connected with you, you'll have to see what are they supposed to do under
24:43
the contract. And that's how businesses will book their revenues. Are we
24:46
together on that? There was a very good question. When will Tetar book the
24:50
revenue of the money that they will charge from you or they have already
24:54
charged from you? Depends on what is the legal agreement that tetar have with the
24:58
customer which is you. Therefore, and at this point reading the legal clauses
25:02
come very very very critical. So tell me what did Tetar promise to do for you?
25:07
Did Tetar promise to give you a job at the end of four years? No. Did Tetar
25:12
promise to make sure that every one of us have a million dollar startup? What
25:18
did Tetar promise to do? Provide education, provide opportunity,
25:23
provide guest lectures, provide uh you know lectures, courses etc. That's what
25:28
they are doing over a period of four years. So Teta will see in which of the
25:33
year the effort is more suppose the effort is equal across four years. So
25:39
the total fees of the program let it be X that will be divided by four and every
25:45
year XX4 XX4 XX4 X4 will be booked. In some programs like a typical MBAs that
25:52
you sometimes will see some terms are heavier some terms are very light. So
25:57
the terms which are very heavier the institute might book more income saying
26:00
this is where my more effort is spent. This is where I deserve to generate more
26:04
income. last term typically in major MBAs typically for two-year MBAs are
26:08
like a project work thesis submission where the professor doesn't have to do
26:12
much about it so instituting the kid is finding a job the networking events
26:16
happening not much of the classes in that case maybe every term will see a
26:20
different number of income being booked how much is 2 plus two
26:25
this is where I brought this point of 2 plus two don't think that all
26:28
educational institute Harvard jail waton teta everybody books their income
26:31
exactly in the same fashion this is according to what the business think
26:35
about their jobs. Are we together on that? All right.
26:40
When will the drop shipper book the revenue?
26:44
What are you supposed to do under the contract as drop shipper?
26:48
Deliver the goods to the customer. And the delivery happens at D8.
26:52
Whether it's prepaid, whether it's a post-paid payment has nothing to do with
26:56
your incomes. Are we together on that? Okay. Question. Yes. You can you go back
27:01
to something on credit like sellers pay on credit. Was that you were saying on
27:06
D8? Um something about credit. Yeah. Yeah.
27:10
Sure. So imagine you are the logistics fellow
27:13
and I'm the drop shipper. I appointed you. I am your customer.
27:18
I asked you to go to the seller, pick up the goods and deliver it to the
27:25
customer. Your job gets over which date?
27:30
Uh, when the customer figure out.
27:34
Uh-huh. D8.
27:36
D8. But when did I make the payment to you?
27:42
No. No. Read it. Just read the case everybody. Whenever
27:47
we are doing a case, you have to be in the game to be able D11, which means you
27:51
did your job at D 8, but you got the payment D 11. Tell me
27:57
what you would have done after delivering the goods to the customer.
28:00
You would have called me for the payment and I what did I give you the money at
28:03
D8? Yeah. No.
28:06
No. What did I give you? Cash.
28:08
Very good. What did I give you on D8? Promise to pay.
28:11
Promise to pay. That's credit. So for you the logistics fellow, D8 is a
28:17
point of sale and for 3 days it was a credit sale and then the collection
28:21
happened. Am I actually getting paid on credit?
28:25
It's an oxymoron. You don't get paid on credit. Either you get paid or you are
28:29
on credit. Yeah. It's like honest politician.
28:34
Either you're honest or you're a politician kind of a thing. You get the
28:38
point? So the delivery, the sale is on credit. Payment is not never on credit.
28:42
You get the point. I didn't understand the word credit.
28:45
Credit is basically a promise to pay. That's about it. Yeah. All right,
28:48
everybody. Let's move up uh and see. Yes or no?
29:11
Yes or no? Question is not how much. Question is when.
29:19
Why no? So you see again it's not accounting
29:28
which is confusing. It is a business model which is confusing. Who has
29:32
appointed whom? Has Kharim appointed McDonald's on the
29:37
portal or has McDonald's appointed Karim as a logistics partner? These are
29:43
absolutely different things. Think about what has happened.
29:49
Well to answer the question I think um McDonald's can book their revenue which
29:54
creates full liability delivery. Okay. The question that I asked is who
30:00
has appointed whom? Has McDonald's appointed Kharim or has Karim appointed
30:07
McDonald's? And by appointment you're not saying
30:11
that I am more senior than it's not a vantage point. It's not a polar
30:15
position. It's just that you know how did the contract happen? Yes sir.
30:20
Very good. Did you order McDonald's or did you order Kharim to get that thing
30:26
from McDonald's? You see the difference? There was a time where in many countries
30:30
McDonald's had their own delivery distribution. They would have bikes with
30:34
you know the McDonald's delivery some 4133 kind of a number hotline numbers
30:39
and that is before these aggregators like Kharim, Uber Eats, Tomatoes etc etc
30:43
came into life. Now there was a time where you had to book an pizza. You
30:47
would call up the Domino's central helpline and Domino's had a 35minut
30:51
delivery time. That is a time where you were ordering Domino's. This time you're
30:57
ordering Kareem. For the customer it is Kareem who is the main guy and then ask
31:04
this question to McDonald's. What is McDonald's supposed to do under the
31:07
contract? What is McDonald's supposed to do under
31:10
the contract? Deliver to Kareem. Absolutely. So what
31:14
is the point of sale for McDonald's? The counter from where Kharim picks up
31:19
the goods. The moment Kharim guy picks up the goods, the sale is over.
31:24
How many people have ever been to a fine dining restaurant?
31:28
Very good. Versus a self-service restaurant. While the customer
31:32
experience may be different, but legally one very important thing which is
31:35
different is the point of sale. What is the point of sale for a fine dining
31:40
restaurant? Where should the food reach for the restaurant to say that my sale
31:45
has happened? The table. Brilliant. But for a self-service restaurant, where
31:50
should the food reach for the guy to say my job is over? It's the counter. So in
31:56
a fine dining restaurant, if a waiter is bringing, let's say, you know, pack of
32:00
drinks and waiter trips, you could not reach till the table. Customer uh cannot
32:04
be charged for it because it is still the the bottles and you know, the wines
32:08
etc. were still restaurants property. It the sale has not been completed. The
32:13
point of sale is still away. But in a self-service restaurant, in case you
32:17
happen to pick some Coca-Cola from McDonald's, you turned around and you
32:21
were moving towards your table and you trip. McDonald's will not give reimburse
32:26
you. McDonald's say, "My job is over. I have already booked the sales and in
32:29
case you want, you tripped. Not my fault. You can order more." Are you with
32:33
me on that? So these are the finer points today that you have to now
32:37
understand as part of the deep dive. Everybody I am so excited that I bring
32:42
this case to you. Working groups in case you wish to sometimes working in group
32:47
is you know helpful. No formats are being given to you today. So far we have
32:52
given you two templates. Uh no bank balance, no list of resources, no list
32:58
of obligation, no equity. The only thing you got to focus on is profit balance.
33:03
That's it. How much time do you think you're going to need for this? That's
33:06
the long and short of the case. That's it.
33:10
Like 15 minutes.
33:13
You think 15 minutes are good enough? All right.
33:17
Don't forget that profit is income minus expenses.
33:23
Profit is income minus expenses. All incomes, all expenses, you have your
33:27
profit. Work with groups in case you wish to. We
33:32
have also shared this PPT on the LMS in case you want to you know take it up
33:38
from there. 15 minutes
34:23
Janna, can you help? Can you just go up and do the same magic that you did?
34:28
Thank you very much. People, it's a good idea. Generally,
34:36
it's a good idea because there is a lot of recursiveness that we will do. If
34:40
this then what, if this, then what? In case you are on pen paper, don't just
34:44
write the amounts. Please write the line items also. You have 15 minutes and it's
34:49
anyway not a laundry list. it'll be easier for you to figure out what number
34:54
did you not get right because you see the point I'm driving home everybody
34:58
listen to this listen to this in numerical things what the problem is and
35:02
it is very disadvantageous to students out of 10 things you got nine right just
35:07
one thing you could not get it right but the final answer goes wrong you get an
35:11
impression that oh my god I did not get anything that's so damaging whenever
35:16
you're handling numericals but that's not true so therefore lining
35:20
writing I think the line items will guide you that you I was not wrong
35:24
completely. It was just one thing or two things that I could not get it. Okay,
35:28
let's get everybody 15 minutes. You all have
35:43
only the income state only the profit value.
38:50
Is the child a student? Yeah.
39:14
very good question. Very very good question. Is there every information
39:19
given in the case that I have to use to make my income statement? Answer is no.
39:23
With the same case, you can make a balance sheet. You can make a cash flow
39:26
statement. You can make an income statement. Only pick up those needles
39:30
from the haststack which you think are related to your incomes and expenses.
39:34
Income is your jobs that you do on the ground and expenses are the consumptions
39:39
that you do. Very good question. Let me know anybody once you're ready
39:47
with the profit number. Make sure you check the number with
39:52
person sitting next to you. people. There are a few things that you
42:04
have to take care. A on the laptop, B the different kind of students. Some are
42:12
paying, some are not paying. Sir, would you want to keep the phone down?
42:17
In case something is very urgent, you can go out and take the call. Okay.
42:23
Uh, so laptop, customers, and then that's it. These are the only
42:30
two trouble points. Let me know in case you have a profit number already.
42:38
No marks for getting it first, but there are marks for getting it right.
42:47
Profit number 32600
42:56
mm 237100.
43:03
Mm. Triple 3500. Mhm.
43:11
But these are great attempts. Can I take a look? Can I? Okay, let me go from
43:14
here. Check the laptop. Number one, check the material. Number two,
43:20
always remember expense is consumption. Expense is not buying. Expense is not
43:26
payment. How much of the paper did you consume?
43:33
Right? Number one. Number two, have you been able to consume entire laptop?
43:40
How much did you use? Ah, you sold it. Correct. So, there are two things that
43:43
you're doing with the laptop. You're using it and you're selling it. Those
43:47
are two different things. Uh, 285 400. You're close, but still not there.
43:52
259,600. No. Come on. Get us the number. Get us the
43:58
number. And so, 210 600 is too low.
44:03
too low. How much is the profit you're getting?
44:08
324 400. No is the consumptions that you're doing.
44:19
So as a what is the business model of the business here?
44:23
What is the primary source of revenue? Counseling, seminars and stuff like
44:28
that. Whatever you think this business is using for the purpose of seminar that
44:35
is an expense. So is rent an expense?
44:39
Yeah. Is advertisement an expense? Yeah. That's how just go on creating. So
44:42
everybody let me give you whenever you are in a jam just think about it. Don't
44:46
take the numbers out of your game. Just write the line items. What are my
44:51
different incomes and what are my different expenses? Just the line items
44:54
first. Then worry about putting a number on it. Numbers will come later. That's
44:58
okay. 28
45:03
285. You are very close. That I can't tell you right now. You
45:13
have to read the case to 71. Everybody the easiest thing for me is to
45:21
give you the answer. I have it here in on my laptop. But that's not why you
45:25
came here for for the answer. You came here to struggle to become better.
45:28
That's what we are doing here. Please read the case with a fine tooth comb.
45:34
Yes, ma'am. Mhm.
45:43
Okay. Okay. Check the laptop. Check the laptop, everybody. Yes, ma'am.
45:52
229700. No. No become a loss right because
45:58
whatever you think so how much how much is 2 plus two whatever you want it to be
46:07
yes is
46:11
very good today you are on fire this is the second good question absolutely yes
46:16
answer is yes 242
46:19
you are enzo at a kissing distance you are at a hitting distance.
46:34
Check the seminar. Check your main income.
46:37
So like that's because I didn't like don't um I I I will not explain
46:41
anything. Okay. Check the income. Check the material. Check check check the
46:47
Yeah. Yeah. I got it. I got it. Yeah.
46:50
You're going away. You're going away from the number
46:53
257900. You're close but not there.
46:57
Lesser. Let me give you a hint. It is less than
47:02
or let's say not less than maybe around $250,000.
47:08
$250,000. It is at a kissing distance to that.
47:15
Like very very close. 250,000. But everybody that's that's a wrong way to
47:20
actually do it. I shouldn't have specified that. You have to go by the
47:23
logic. You now will channelize all your energy to make sure that your number
47:27
reaches to that number. That is not a right approach. Go by the logic.
47:33
How many incomes? Let me just check. How many incomes did you consider?
47:38
How many incomes? Not how much. How many how many incomes line items?
47:44
I got 2400. Uh you're very close but not quite
47:48
there. Very close. Patricia uh three. First is
47:56
a laptop sale. Laptop sale will result into some gain
48:00
or a loss. Second is your scrap sale. And third is your seminar. The services
48:07
that you do that's your primary you know the main sales or revenue. These are the
48:12
three things that will constitute your total income. And how many expenses have
48:16
you considered? No. 250. Oh my god, you are very very
48:20
close. Maybe one thing here and there. Material is not correct.
48:26
Material advertisement rent laptop usage is not here. So there are a couple of
48:31
things that you got to do. Material material
48:35
45. No, no.
48:36
Am I going closer? 257.
48:39
I'm not going to tell you. It's going to spoil you for the 257.
48:45
248 something. Mhm.
48:58
So I got cancel. That's not no. So that's not an income.
49:12
Income always have to be when you are actually doing your main job on the
49:16
ground. That's your funding define that it was okay.
49:21
248900 is the closest we have seen so far.
49:28
248900 is the closest we have seen so far.
49:35
2400 that's again in the same vicinity. 235.
49:40
Now Everybody, the key point is laptop
49:52
material. Their rent expenses just for a month.
49:55
Just for a month. Just for a month. Yeah.
49:58
Rent expenses for a month. 248300. You're very very close. You're
50:05
becoming closer. What did you change? Reusable material.
50:11
Reusable material. Okay. People read the case and while you're solving a case you
50:16
have to be in the game. You have to be in the seminar hall where a seminar is
50:20
happening. Then you will connect to the business model. Well,
50:33
any corrections in that? 248 900 251
50:40
251 triple 0
50:42
200 200 You're going far
50:46
2 48200 248200
50:49
you see these are marginal move I actually don't remember the right number
50:53
honestly whenever somebody says oh you are close oh you are at a kissing oh and
50:57
then you are continuously updating yourself
51:00
okay just continue to update for five more minutes
51:03
this is the final Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Let's see in 5 minutes
51:07
from now. 80,000. Yeah.
51:17
Ask her. The question is why?
51:24
She's too busy. You see, she's too busy. Why is that not Why is bank funding not
51:31
an income? That's an obligation. You got to pay it
51:35
back. Income is when you deal with your customers on the ground. Bank is an
51:39
investor. Cash coming in is not your income everybody. That's liquidity.
51:45
So there is something something just like a plus.
51:56
So how to be correct? That's exactly the point I mentioned. See um now maybe
52:01
there is there's only one element that is not right.
52:04
How do we correct that? Depreciation on it.
52:08
There has to be a depreciation on it. Yeah.
52:11
24700 247700.
52:15
The suspense is going to get over in the next 2 minutes.
52:18
247900 27900. Okay. That is relevant. Of course that is
52:26
relevant. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody I um want to ask a question.
52:45
Um who are you? Okay. And who are you?
52:50
That's the mistake that you all are doing.
52:54
That's the mistake you are doing. You know who are you? You are the business.
53:00
The business who is doing all of that. You are the one who is organizing the
53:04
seminar. You are the one who are handling students. You are the one who
53:07
is buying the laptop. You are the one. The moment you step into the shoes of a
53:10
business, the rules go away. Common sense take over.
53:15
All right everybody, you enter the class not as a student. You enter the class as
53:19
a business. And this is a welcome change from drop shipping. We've handed we have
53:22
had two, you know, cases of drop shipping already. But I don't want to
53:26
make this entire course of drop shipping on accounting because there is no other
53:30
course on let's say next term you're going to do D2C. There is no we will not
53:34
meet again on these basics. So whatever is any business model in the world we
53:38
have to learn the accounting here itself. So it will smell of drop
53:41
shipping but it can't just be drop shipping altogether. Are you with me on
53:44
that? Okay. So um okay. All right. Just just uh by the
53:51
time uh people are still in the group, I want to ask a question. How many line
53:57
items on the expense do they have? Seven.
54:03
Six. Five. Six.
54:07
Which ones? Which ones? Line items on expenses.
54:12
Which ones? Material. Okay, that's one.
54:18
Advertisement. That is two. Rent that is three.
54:24
Legal that is four. Very good. Did you use laptop also?
54:31
Yes, you're very close. Very close. I think that's the number but I don't
54:34
remember. So you did you use the laptop? Yes, laptop is also the one.
54:39
Rent. Yeah, rent. I have picked material. I have picked up.
54:46
Sorry. Yeah. I shall do that.
54:49
Yes. Yes. But did you use legal services?
54:54
Yeah. Uh where is the legal service? Yes. In spite of the fact that it is
54:59
unpaid, did you use it? Yeah. Therefore, it's going to come in
55:02
the statement of profit. Yes, sir. Uh to 4,9800. Let's see. Let's see.
55:10
So, now the reality is I don't exactly remember what that is, but I can faintly
55:15
I can I can faintly recall it is somewhat
55:20
249ish something or 248ish something. Just hold on to your horses. Just hold
55:26
on to the horses now. Okay. So, five line items. Any any other line item?
55:33
Any other line item for expenses? Interest.
55:40
There is a bank interest. And and uh is this promoter withdrawing
55:47
600 also an expense? I say yes.
55:50
Yeah. Okay. So let's just put a number to this as well. Seven
55:55
legal services. The legal services I have included.
55:58
No. That's okay. But have you The question
56:02
is not whether you've paid it or not. The question is have you used the
56:06
services? Yes people. What is liability and what is expense? An expense can also
56:11
be a liability. When you don't pay for something that
56:14
you consume, it becomes a liability. 400,000.
56:17
That's okay. The question that you have to ask is did you consume or not? If
56:22
answer is yes, you better write it. Okay. In the bank balance, that's the
56:28
question you will ask. Did I pay or not? Answer is no, fine. Don't write it in
56:32
the bank balance. Write it under obligation. That's the debate out there.
56:35
Okay, everybody. Uh should we give you the number first or should we discuss
56:40
about the laptop first? laptop first. Okay. Now the way a
56:45
businessman will think is the following. How much did you buy the laptop for?
56:51
24. Okay. How much did you sell it for? 23500. So over the month there is a net
56:57
net mathematical loss of 500. Are you with me on that? Mathematical loss from
57:05
laptop is a 500. However, a good trained entrepreneur to report the performance
57:13
pretty well will do the following. There are two things that you did with the
57:17
laptop. Number one, you used the laptop, right? There is a charge for usage. And
57:22
then you sold the laptop. There may be a gain or a sale based on what you give,
57:26
what you take. Are you with me on that? Now, how much did you buy the laptop
57:30
for? I'm making a working note. Okay. 24,000
57:34
is the cost of laptop. How much was the life?
57:40
No. No. Overall life total 12. 1 month there is 11 months. 11
57:45
more months. The total life is 12 months. Which means every month the
57:50
usage cost is the amount that you consume every month.
57:56
Correct. The laptop was used to the extent of
58:01
2,000. Welcome to expense usage.
58:07
Are you with me on that? Now you have made the laptop go from a 24 minus a
58:12
two. The laptop becomes 22,000 at the month end. What is the value of
58:19
the laptop that you sold? Answer simple this question of mine. Did you sell the
58:25
brand new laptop? Did you sell a old laptop? What is the cost of the laptop
58:31
that you sold? 24 or 22. 22. That's the point. You've
58:37
already used 2,000 of worth. That's not going to be included in gain or loss. So
58:42
here you are basically selling something whose cost is 22. How much did you sell
58:49
it for? 23500.
58:54
Gain or loss? Therefore, the
58:59
gain on sale 1,500.
59:07
People, if you summate these two, add these two, what is the net mathematical
59:13
implication? - 2,000 plus, 1500. What is the
59:19
mathematical? That's exactly what as a businessman
59:22
also what you did. 24,000 you paid for 23 you sold it for net net losses 500
59:27
during the month but you see a better educated version of it you are doing two
59:31
things with the laptop you're using it and then you are selling it why is this
59:35
bifurcation important I'll tell you using the laptop remember operating
59:39
investing financing operating what activities
59:43
dayto-day very good financing or capital structure debt and equity and investing
59:48
with related to long-term assets buying a long-term asset is investing Investing
59:53
or operating? Buying a long-term asset.
59:58
Okay. Tetar. Buying this camera. Investing. Selling remains investing.
1:00:05
But using a long-term asset is very good. That means this part 2,000 is
1:00:13
operating. Whereas this part 1,500 gain on sale is
1:00:21
investing. Are you with me on that? Mathematically,
1:00:26
I'm in sync. Net net damage is 500. But I don't write just as a 500. I will
1:00:31
write as a 2,000 minus as an expense and 1,500 as an income. Are we together on
1:00:36
that? So there are three incomes that you will show. Seminar income delivery
1:00:41
to the students. Second is your scrap sales and third gain on sale of laptop.
1:00:47
Are we together? Okay. Let us see what the profit is.
1:01:04
The profit is 249400. Oh, I think the the slideshow must be
1:01:15
on. One sec. One sec. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hang on.
1:01:23
Whenever the slides on, you have to exit that maybe and then it shows up.
1:01:31
Where is the Excel? H.
1:01:38
Yeah. 249400
1:01:48
is the final profit. Is there anybody who got there? Very
1:01:55
good. After how many? 20 attempts like no 18.
1:01:59
Five attempts. Okay. Finally was able to hit the bulls.
1:02:05
It is like I said, it is not about getting the final answer right. It's
1:02:10
about getting the logic right. For each of these people ask questions. You're
1:02:14
coming here to ask questions. You're not coming here for the solution.
1:02:19
Which adjustment? Good. Ask those questions. So, what is
1:02:27
your question everybody? Uh the case was given to you.
1:02:33
You can download it or maybe what you can do now is to maybe click a picture
1:02:37
so that once I'm on the Excel file, it is easier.
1:02:43
Can you just click a picture of this? 84. I'll come to that. I'll come to
1:02:54
that. Just give me a minute. I'm just allowing everybody. Picture clicked.
1:02:57
Everybody. Okay. 3 2
1:03:02
1. Everybody, what is your income? the
1:03:11
delivery that you do, right? How many students did you serve?
1:03:16
90 or 84? The question is very important. Question
1:03:20
is not how many students did pay. The question is how many student did you
1:03:24
serve? 90. Therefore, this seminar fees 3500 *
1:03:31
90. I know money did not come in but at the point of sale while you were
1:03:36
delivering this counseling what did six people give you promise brilliant and
1:03:41
you had no reason to believe that the two people will get absconded later on
1:03:47
at that moment it looked like a healthy promise accounting is updating yourself
1:03:51
as and when new business information comes in but when I was delivering the
1:03:54
seminar it felt that six people who did not promise will pay tomorrow it's okay
1:03:59
so I can book that as an income that's your seminar fees, your primary sales.
1:04:04
But then there was some cartoon boxes that you could sell for 2,000. And then
1:04:09
this is the gain on laptop sales. We just discussed it there. Are we
1:04:14
together? Total income is 318500.
1:04:22
I'll come to that. I'll come to that. Okay. Let me just explain the income
1:04:25
part and then I'll go line by line. Sorted. Everybody still here? All right.
1:04:30
Next question. Coming on the line items. By the way, I'm using the word line
1:04:33
item. Line item. What do you think line item means?
1:04:38
That's it. The item which is appearing in different lines. Remember how
1:04:43
accounting is what you would want it to be. So in case you are a business, you
1:04:47
think I want to club these two. I want to show them separately. It's up to you.
1:04:50
There are no set formats. That's a problem of a CPA and a charted
1:04:54
accountant who has to report to the government. You don't have to report to
1:04:57
the government. You have to take internal decisionm for you. There is no
1:05:00
format. So you are absolutely free. Oh you want to put scrap below this this
1:05:04
above this feel free be my guest. Formats are not important in this class.
1:05:08
The understanding and the structure is coming to the expenses. Why is it not
1:05:12
44? You paid for 44,000 but you consumed only 31 because 13,000
1:05:20
worth of goods are still lying with you. So what does it tell you about expense?
1:05:24
Expense is not what you pay for. Expense is what you consume. Anything which you
1:05:30
pay for and it is still with you is what which you can use it tomorrow is what is
1:05:36
an asset for you is an asset for you. So think about you know a prepaid talk time
1:05:41
balance yesterday you recharge it let's say for 50 dirhams you've already spoken
1:05:45
used the data for 10 dirhams 10 dirham is an expense because this is what you
1:05:49
consumed 40 dirham of balance which you paid still with you is an asset so asset
1:05:55
and expense both need me to pay the cash but the difference is not payment
1:06:00
difference is the consumption part of it so is that material consumed clear to
1:06:04
everybody all right advertisement was straightforward rent was straightforward
1:06:09
Legal service was interesting. It was not paid for. But the question is not
1:06:14
here. We are not answering a question of payment. We are answering a question of
1:06:19
profitability. And therefore I am going to charge 400
1:06:24
as an expense whether paid or not. Coming to the laptop, how much is the
1:06:29
laptop usage? Laptop usage was 2,000. So 2,000 comes as an expense. You see
1:06:36
everybody that's what I meant. 1,500 income, 2,000 expense, net net 500
1:06:41
damage. That's what a businessman will think like. But businesses sometimes
1:06:46
only think better. They have to also report it better together. So far,
1:06:51
moving on. What are these bad debts or credits?
1:06:57
These are those remember what was the bifurcation about the customers? You had
1:07:03
90 people overall out of which how many people paid on time?
1:07:08
Very good. Six people gave you what? Promise. At that point it was a good
1:07:13
promise. Later on four people continued to be good promise but two people became
1:07:22
bad promise. If I had known that these two students will become bad later, I
1:07:29
would have asked them to leave the seminar room there and then I'm not a
1:07:32
charitable organization. I'm a profit-making business. Are you with me
1:07:35
on that? But at the point of sale, the promise that was given to me felt
1:07:40
healthy. So therefore, I booked the sale. Remember how many students have I
1:07:45
booked here in my sales? Full 90. Later on when I called them up, when
1:07:51
will you give the payment? Four picked up and says no. Yes, sir. Yes sir, we
1:07:53
will give the payment. Two did not pick up only. Now this is where 2 + 2 is how
1:07:58
much? Four comes into the picture. When a friend does not pick up a phone,
1:08:05
what does or what can it mean? Can it mean that the friend has
1:08:12
Can it mean that the friend is no longer a friend and he has blocked me? Can it
1:08:17
mean that he might be in his or her shower? That's it. Can it? So it depends
1:08:22
upon what you think at that moment. This business according to my presentation
1:08:27
here is thinking that it's a retail customer. It's not a B2B customer. It's
1:08:32
a retail customer. And a retail customer is very hard to track and you can only
1:08:36
track by calling them. And in case somebody is not picking up the phone
1:08:39
again and again, that means they have eloped. This business thinks that this
1:08:44
7,000 will not come. But you have already booked that as an income. So you
1:08:50
got to reverse the collection that you thought will come will not come now.
1:08:55
Don't you think it's a loss for you? Something somebody has to give it to you
1:08:59
and now they're not going to give it to you. It's a loss to you. So uh 3500
1:09:05
fees times two students bad debts. I swear I swear if these bad
1:09:15
students had been known to me from the first day, I swear I would have booked
1:09:21
it at 88 only. But at the moment of delivery, the
1:09:26
moment of sale, the promise given to me was healthy. And the question is how
1:09:31
many students did I serve? 88 or 90? That's the point. Sales is the work that
1:09:37
you do. Sales is your output. Sales is the turnover that you create.
1:09:42
So far so good everybody. Is there any line item that we are
1:09:48
missing? Is there any line item that we are
1:09:54
missing from the case?
1:09:59
Is there any line item that we are missing from the case?
1:10:03
The promoter. The promoter withdrew cash for her personal usage.
1:10:10
What is this? Is this an income? Is this an expense? What is this?
1:10:16
Looks like an expense. Promoter like bank will take something, rent, landlord
1:10:22
will take something, employee will take something, supplier will take something,
1:10:25
then promoter should also take something. Correct? So, can I add that
1:10:30
amount also as one of the line item 600 rupees here itself? Answer is a no.
1:10:36
Answer is a no. Now listen to the story about how is an expense different than
1:10:42
something called as a dividend. This is the first time the word dividend is
1:10:47
coming into your life. Okay, listen to this carefully. What is an expense?
1:10:52
Expense is a consumption. Can you complete the line? In the process of
1:10:57
in the very good say say more in the process of
1:11:01
expense is a consumption in the process of
1:11:05
providing product or a service. Fantastic. You
1:11:10
withdraw anything from here. You will not be able to generate this output.
1:11:16
You withdraw this material, you withdraw this advertisement without the rent,
1:11:19
without the laptop, without the legal service, you will not be able to
1:11:22
generate this output. That is an expense. Expense is something without
1:11:26
which your output is not possible. If I don't pay to karim in the morning
1:11:31
20 dirhams to come from my hotel to here, I cannot come here. That means
1:11:35
that payment is an expense for me. It is mandatory for me to generate that
1:11:40
income. Are you with me on that? But what is this 600? What is the nature of
1:11:44
this 600? Owner would have come up and how is the work? Yeah, it's pretty good.
1:11:50
Uh you see I have to also pay my personal rent etc. So owner would have
1:11:53
withdrawn 600 from the bag from the business and would have paid his
1:11:58
personal rent and stuff like that. From the point of view of the business this
1:12:01
600 is a withdrawal. 600 reduces the size of the bag. 600 reduces the owner's
1:12:07
money in the bag. But imagine if owner had not come or owner had withdrawn
1:12:11
double. Will the students the service to the student change? That's the point.
1:12:17
Therefore, I cannot put that dividend, that discretionary withdrawal,
1:12:22
I use the word voluntary withdrawals in the list of these mandatory expenses.
1:12:27
But the point is that's also a reality. Today, we are extending your income
1:12:33
statement beyond just profit. People, today is an interesting day. You get to
1:12:39
learn the difference between profit and retained earnings.
1:12:45
No pressure. What is 249400?
1:12:50
Money generated by dash for dash. What is 249400?
1:12:56
Money generated by very good business for
1:13:04
services. Money generated by business. But for
1:13:08
whom? Owner.
1:13:13
Whom does profit belong to? owners. So who is generating this?
1:13:19
The business. But it belongs to whom? The owners. Where is this profit lying?
1:13:27
Where is this profit lying? In the business or shareholders pocket?
1:13:31
Shareholders pocket. Okay, let's do something. Let's do something. You're
1:13:34
taking too much pressure. Just take it easy.
1:13:38
We have what, like 7 minutes left. My god. My god. Easy.
1:13:46
Generally in accounting class, finance class, these kind of small disruptions
1:13:51
happens. Just take it easy. It's a deliberate
1:13:56
pause. Keep breathing. Keep breathing.
1:14:01
You've done such a good job. For the other section, we could not even reach
1:14:05
till this point. So, you guys are doing anyway a very good job.
1:14:10
And does is anybody carrying a very light
1:14:13
bag? Very very light bag. Yes.
1:14:19
Okay. Everybody
1:14:24
meet. What do you think it is? It is the business.
1:14:31
It is the business. The bag is the business. Okay. and bag
1:14:40
is managed by somebody called a CEO. CEO is not the owner. CEO is an employee, a
1:14:47
glorified employee who runs the show, who does not own the show. Are you with
1:14:51
me on that? Now, the story and do you read this? And
1:14:57
I'm sure you have, you know, a bit of the figures as well. This is pretty
1:15:01
heavy. Come on, give me a light one. I have to continue to hold it for a long
1:15:05
time. And so, you are a bodybuilder. Your light and my light are very
1:15:09
different. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. You are
1:15:13
so lovely. Thank you very much. Everybody meet the business. Okay. Sleek
1:15:19
asset light. Okay. Now, um uh what's your good name, ma'am?
1:15:23
Sophia. Sophia. Sophia. Uh do you have some
1:15:26
props, some pen, papers, whatever? No. No. I have to go to the owner only.
1:15:32
No. Yeah. Maybe just give the give the back
1:15:34
itself. Okay. So, everybody uh just hold it. I'll come to you. So, uh, a business
1:15:39
was started for event management counseling. How much money did owners
1:15:43
contribute? Read the case. How much money did owners
1:15:46
contribute? 20,000. Owner, give me the money. Where?
1:15:50
Who gives money to whom? Owner gives money to the business. So,
1:15:55
the money, the cash goes into the business bank account. But the bank
1:15:59
account of the owner goes down. Fair point. Who is holding the money now?
1:16:04
Business. But who is indirectly owning the money? The owner. Never forget. I as
1:16:11
a CEO I felt that yeah this is too little you know I need to buy more
1:16:14
things etc. This is too less. Owner can you give me more money? Owner said no.
1:16:18
Owner said no. Sophia owner said no. Okay we are in the game. We are in the
1:16:23
game. And therefore uh somebody says why don't you borrow from the bank. So I
1:16:27
went to the bank and borrowed and the business made a commitment I'll repay.
1:16:32
That's why it's a liability. Did you hear me saying I will repay true Sophia?
1:16:37
No. Because to an equity guy, it is never an obligation. Equity. What do you
1:16:42
give? You give the ownership to the debt. You never give the ownership. You
1:16:46
give a promise to repay. So here is Enzo's money also where in the bag. Now
1:16:52
how much money does the bag own? 100,000. This is the initial funding in
1:16:56
the business. Remember and by the way these two are my capital structure debt
1:16:59
and equity. Now business have enough money. Business will start to buy some
1:17:03
assets. Business will start to do some activities, some income and expenses.
1:17:07
All of that done. Who is working? By the way, are these two working or is the CEO
1:17:11
working? That's the point. That's the role
1:17:14
differentiation. Owners don't work. The CEO's work. So the CEO is managing the
1:17:18
show, generating sales and then incurring expenses, this and that. How
1:17:22
much money did the business end up generating?
1:17:26
How much money does the business end up generating as profit?
1:17:32
249400. Are you with me on that? Where is this
1:17:35
249400 lying? In the bag. Have you paid to the
1:17:41
employees? You have paid to the employees. You have
1:17:44
paid for the material. Have you charged for the legal services? Have you charged
1:17:47
for laptops? Have you charged for everything else? Yes. Except I did not
1:17:52
pay anything back to the owner. The money is lying in the bag belonging to
1:17:58
Sophia. I went to Sophia. It's saying Sophia I am holding 2 lak 49,400
1:18:04
worth of profit that you own but is held by me. You see the difference. Business
1:18:10
never owns anything. It only is because it is ultimately owned by the equity.
1:18:15
Business is the just a possessor of things. Think of it that way. So the
1:18:19
business possesses the profit belonging to Sophia. Sophia, would you want to
1:18:22
withdraw anything for your rent, groceries, etc.? Sophia say yes. How
1:18:26
much Sophia are you withdrawing? How much are you withdrawing from the
1:18:30
business? 600. 600 worth of money comes out and is
1:18:36
given to the owner. Who is paying to whom?
1:18:39
Business is paying to the owner. The bank balance of the
1:18:44
business will decrease. The profits were distributed,
1:18:48
right? So the amount of profit that I was holding on behalf of Sophia will
1:18:53
reduce size of the bag becomes bigger or smaller.
1:18:57
That's the point. That's the point. Imagine if Sophia had not withdrawn
1:19:01
anything or had withdrawn more money. Will the profit change
1:19:06
because of this line item? Look at my finger carefully. Because of this line
1:19:10
item, will this change? No. Profits come first.
1:19:17
When I had profits, I went to Sophia. I did not go to Sophia beforehand. I had
1:19:23
the profit amount already. 249400 is a reality in our life. Nobody can
1:19:28
change it. The only question that I went to Sophia with was how much would you
1:19:33
want to withdraw out of it? Sophia said 600. But imagine there are four slices
1:19:38
on the table. I decide to eat one slice. Even if I decide to eat two slices, the
1:19:42
total slices will remain four. No, because slices came first and what I
1:19:45
decided to eat came later. The profits came first.
1:19:50
Sophia's whims and fancies, discretionary, voluntary withdrawals
1:19:53
came later. Sophia decided, who knows? Sophia says, "No, no, no. Don't give me
1:19:57
anything. Just let it remain all in the business. It's all the same thing."
1:20:01
Sophia said, "No, give me 600." No problem, Sophia. You take 600. The
1:20:04
profits that I was holding on her behalf will go down by 600 because now I've
1:20:10
given her 600 her share. Are you with me on that?
1:20:13
This is a voluntary withdrawal by the owner which is not the expense. Expense
1:20:18
is something without which your incomes cannot come in. So tell me with the
1:20:23
guest lecture that Teta organizes for all of you is it expense or is it a
1:20:28
voluntary expression of some withdrawal? It is an expense because the whole
1:20:34
program cannot function without those guest programs and the guest lectures.
1:20:38
My fees is it an expense or a dividend for Teta? without my fees you can't
1:20:44
collect you know fees from all of you are you with me on that so this is what
1:20:49
is the business is still holding how much money belonging to Sophia
1:20:55
business is how much uh holding how much money belonging to Sophia 248800
1:21:01
can I say this is the part of the same profit fair point which has not been
1:21:06
distributed out can I say that and if not distributed out where does it get
1:21:11
retained retained here in the bag. Can I say 248800
1:21:16
is nothing but retained profits? Can I say 600 is nothing but distributed
1:21:21
profits? And can I say 249400 nothing but total profits? Are you with me on
1:21:27
that? That is how the businesses are run and managed and controlled. Are we
1:21:33
together on that? Stay with me for last one second. How many people recall step
1:21:38
A, B, C, D of Elon Musk? People, we did it then because we have
1:21:45
to use it in future. Today is that future
1:21:49
debt. Debt. One second. Sophia, thank you very
1:21:53
much for volunting everybody. Step number one. Step a
1:21:57
step a forance. Very no. No. So you're raising money
1:22:02
from debt and equity. Correct. Step two. Invest.
1:22:07
Invest the yellow box. Step three, buy cash flow.
1:22:12
Cash flows from cash flows from
1:22:16
customers. That's your income. Step C 318500.
1:22:21
That's is the income. Step four, what was step D
1:22:25
to your suppliers, governments, uh, rent, so on so forth. Step number D, all
1:22:33
your expenses are nothing but step D. What was surplus on that day? C minus D.
1:22:38
That's your profit. That is C minus D. What was step number F?
1:22:47
Repayment. Repayment to
1:22:50
the financers. Sophia, you just got step number F in form of 600. What is 600?
1:22:56
Who's paying to whom? Business is paying to back to the
1:23:00
investors. That's what step F was. And what you did not pay out got retained
1:23:06
where? In the business itself. That is step E.
1:23:12
That's it. If you want to grow very fast as a
1:23:17
business, will you pay more to Sophia or will you pay less to Sophia?
1:23:21
That's it. Simple. If I'm a very old company not knowing where to invest,
1:23:26
where to grow the money and I generate some profit. Let's say General Electric,
1:23:30
Walmart, Nvidia's, no not Nvidia, my bad. Uh let's say Toyota. These are all
1:23:35
very mature companies. They can't grow their sales by 30, 40, 50%. Like AI is
1:23:39
doing these days. In case they generate profit, they give hefty dividends to the
1:23:43
owners. They don't know where to invest this money because the more I keep
1:23:47
Sophia's money in the bag, Sophia's expectation for higher profits tomorrow
1:23:53
will be more. Think about it. Sophia is going to look at the return on the
1:23:57
capital employed initially. How much capital did she employ? 20,000 on which
1:24:03
I generated a return of 2 lakh 49,000. Can you imagine like a 10 10 times
1:24:08
return? If I tell Sophia Sophia now I am holding not 20,000 for you but 249400
1:24:16
for you that means Sophia's expectation for the second year's return is going to
1:24:20
be a humongous thing. So the business cannot just continue to hold owners
1:24:25
money just like that. Business have to also think about it that how much is a
1:24:30
reasonable reinvestment that I can give in case reinvestments are not possible.
1:24:35
Apple one of the fastest growing companies today between 2012 and 2014
1:24:40
had a massive program massive as in massive program to distribute cash to
1:24:45
the shareholders. They say we are holding so much cash in the bag we don't
1:24:49
know what to do and because we are holding so much cash shareholder thinks
1:24:52
we are doing some wonders they expect more dividends we can't give more
1:24:56
dividends because we are it's lying waste take it back that's the difference
1:25:00
that's the debate between the shareholder and the owner how much is
1:25:04
how much of capital is enough capital but anyway those are all business-like
1:25:08
things and we will discuss you know it much later but are you sorted on that
1:25:12
so Sophia's money in the bag she started her journey with 20,000
1:25:16
The money grew by 249,400 but then it reduced by 600 again. So the
1:25:23
total money Sophia has in the bag is 248800
1:25:29
plus Sophia how much did you contribute initially?
1:25:32
20,000. This is total owner's money in the bag. That's what we did. Equity
1:25:38
valuation. What was equity valuation that we did yesterday? Opening capital
1:25:42
plus the profits that you generate. That was equity's value. But this time there
1:25:47
is an added advantage of the dividends. All right everybody, I must tell you
1:25:52
that you guys did a fabulous job. To understand all of this in one session is
1:25:57
impossible. So don't judge yourself too much. Tomorrow again we are going to
1:26:02
bring up some case like this. We will reaffirm our understanding about what
1:26:05
dividends are and so on so forth. But you guys were fabulous. Very good. So if
1:26:10
you're like

26/09/2025 | 08:30 AM - 10:00 AM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:09
Okay, everybody quiz time. Yeah. So it's a contact and basically
0:16
it's more about struggles.
0:30
Thank you. Ready?
2:13
Ready everybody?
2:25
Yes. Anyone not able to join?
2:29
Rishi uh who's logged in with the name Rishi?
2:37
Yeah. Whatever.
3:15
Let's begin. Okay, let's see who gets how many right.
3:40
We discussed multiple profits before tax, operating profit, gross
3:46
profit, stuff like that. Which of these will fall?
4:03
So the structure was everybody um sales minus COGS was your gross profit. Okay,
4:12
depreciation has no role in it. So depreciation going up or down gross
4:15
profit will not be impacted. Then you had selling general administrative all
4:20
those expenses you get EIDA earning before interest tax and depreciation.
4:26
Still depreciation has no role in it. Depreciation will impact only the
4:29
profits which come after depreciation has been included which is your EBIT
4:33
your taxable income and so on so forth. So this question is a reminder of the
4:37
fact that you have to always remember the sequence in which different expenses
4:41
are to be subtracted. Okay, today is going to be a re reaffirmation of the
4:46
same thing. Don't worry about that. But happy to see that you know at least 15%
4:50
got this right. Okay, let's move. Well, for the Coca-Cola company, buying
5:33
land is operating, investing or financing?
5:36
Investing. So, in any case, operating and financing activities will not be
5:40
impacted. And cash is coming in or cash is going out?
5:44
Going out. Therefore, CFI will reduce. Okay. Next.
6:26
people. This one's clearly not the answer because when the business pays
6:30
out something to the shareholders, the money with the business goes down. So,
6:36
you categorized it right financing, but the direction was incorrect. Okay. All
6:41
right. Let's move to the next question.
6:59
You have 20 seconds. Long 20 seconds to answer.
7:23
Now here how much is the rent that you have paid?
7:29
How much is the rent that you have paid? 1,200. Okay. Even after payment, how
7:36
much was still due? 250. Which means how much you should
7:41
have paid at the first place? 1450 1200 plus 250 that's and why you should have
7:48
paid that much maybe that is because that's your consumption. So the rental
7:53
bill was a 1450 you paid 1200 and therefore 250 was outstanding. So any
8:00
three out of which two given you can find out the third one. Are you with me
8:05
on that? So here I could have also restated the question as the rental
8:09
expense is 1450 and over you know is it overpayment or
8:14
underpayment? Underpayment. The rent expense is 1450
8:19
and it was underpaid by 250. How much must have been paid? 1,200.
8:25
Are you with me on that? Okay. So correct option was 1450 in this case.
8:38
Y stands for yen. This is tricky. Equal.
9:09
Equal. Absolutely equal. Come on. Increase the volume. Thank you
9:19
everybody. Let's look at it one more time.
9:24
How much is the total balance of reserves? But first of all, reserves are
9:29
held by whom and for whom? Reserves are held by
9:35
the business. Very good. For whom? The shareholders. Ultimately, it is the
9:40
profit which was not distributed. So, how much is the closing balance of
9:44
everything all said and done? How much are the reserves after everything has
9:48
been done? A,000. Okay. Now, focus on what happened during the year. How much
9:53
was the profit which is an increment to the reserve during the year?
9:57
700. Out of which how much was withdrawn automatically?
10:01
500. That means how much during the year was the increment?
10:05
200. And how much did you end the year with?
10:08
1,000. Increment during the year was only 200. Where is the balance 800
10:12
coming from? The last year. That's how the opening
10:16
balance of 800 would have been the answer. People think about it. Reserves
10:21
are shareholders wallet in the bag. How much money does the wallet have is equal
10:28
to if the closing money is for example 1,000 during the year you pumped in 700
10:34
and you took out 500 how much money would the wallet have at the beginning?
10:38
800. Now read the story straightforward. The wallet had 800 rupees in the bag.
10:45
Okay. Uh business made a profit of 700. How much is the total money in the bag?
10:51
800 + 700 is 1,500. Out of which 500 was withdrawn as
10:57
dividend. So how much money is left in the wallet? A,000. That's how the stream
11:02
is. So out of four any three you've given, you can find out the fourth one.
11:07
People this is actually a reaffirmation. I understand this was tricky. This is
11:11
reaffirmation that as promoters you have to be very quick on calculating a few
11:16
things. It is not going to be enough. I repeat, it is not going to be enough to
11:20
just have a good product and be able to sell it at a higher value.
11:25
So for example, here Enzo's team has a product at a cost of X and they're
11:30
selling it for let's say 54 dirhams. Now 54 minus X let's say the cost is 50. So
11:38
54 minus 50 4 dirham per product are they making? It's job done well but
11:43
that's not enough. You have made money. That's okay. But is that enough for you
11:48
to take home? That is what is important. You started a business not because for
11:52
the joy of it, but because you wanted to become wealthy. So this statement that
11:57
you see here is actually measuring and tracking the wealth that you have in the
12:01
business. Today's class is going to be let's let's first look at the uh
12:06
results. 292 Sakit well done 29147
12:17
well done and Anun here superb good job done
12:24
everybody all right
12:32
can we have more lights also so people today is a special day and I am
12:36
extremely happy for multiple reasons should I start telling one after the
12:40
other or you want to know the the biggest reason that I'm happy about one
12:44
after the other. Okay. Chal uh today is a day where we are going to talk about a
12:49
case where there are two years back to back. So far we have already you see we
12:55
have done so many cases with each other. Session four,
12:58
session five drop shipping case. Session six uh counseling case, session seven
13:03
again a counseling case and then u you know today is like session 8 and 9. This
13:08
is a time where we are going to do a case which have two years back to back.
13:12
We have never done that. That's one reason of happiness. Second, we have
13:16
always done cases. We have always looked at businesses which have made money but
13:20
that's not the reality. Here is a business a lot of businesses
13:24
which will do good job but and ultimately they'll figure out oh my god
13:27
there is a loss like any startup. So how does lossm startups look like? Today is
13:32
going to be the day where we are going to look at it. Third reason for
13:36
happiness is we never really formally speak and spoke about the entrepreneurs.
13:43
Today is a day where we will zoom into the entrepreneurs and speak more about
13:47
them. So far we have spoken only about calculate the profit. So calculate the
13:51
bank balance. That's what we have done at best. What we have done long ago in
13:55
session four last week was can you sum total all the resources that you have?
13:59
Can you sum total all the obligations here? That was like a cursory example.
14:02
We just found out some value of equity if we're using two formulas and I told
14:06
that day that don't worry even if you don't get it there will be a day where
14:09
we will focus on equity. Today is a day where we focus on equity. Okay. So these
14:13
are the three main reasons for happiness. In addition to that today we
14:17
are closing phase two of our course. Phase one was hardly any accounting. We
14:22
were just warming you up. We were just preparing the ground. Okay. We're doing
14:25
things like operating, investing, financing, legal forms. This is not
14:28
accounting. This is base building. This week was where the actual accounting
14:33
started. You were looking at profit and loss account, your income statements in
14:36
detail. You're looking at liquidity which is cash flow statement in detail.
14:40
And today we are going to look at the balance sheet in detail. That's where
14:43
the real solid accounting is happening. So we are closing the phase today so
14:47
that next time when we meet in October we are going to begin with the analysis
14:52
and reading part of it. So a bit of a reading I will bring to you today also.
14:57
It will give you a sense as to what your day job is going to look like as
15:00
entrepreneur. You may have an accountant hired to do the accounting job, but
15:04
you'll have to still read the numbers and make sense of it. You can't hire
15:08
somebody else for that also. So imagine how stupid that entrepreneur will be
15:12
that there is an accountant employed and there is an analyst also employed.
15:16
Entrepreneur does not does not know anything about the business. For
15:19
everything else they have outsourced it. That's not possible. At least the
15:22
understanding bit has to happen today. Okay everybody? Are we ready? So uh we
15:27
always begin with where we left and um can you quickly read through the
15:30
questions? Every financial statement, balance
15:35
sheet, cash flow, income statement, they are an answer. Go to a question. What
15:40
kind of questions can a balance sheet answer? These kind of questions. Quickly
15:43
scan through them. Anywhere do you see the word liquidity?
15:58
Anywhere do you see the word cash flows? You see the word performance,
16:02
profitability, efficiency? Never. That means balance
16:06
sheet has a very limited purpose. Balance sheet is only as good to talk
16:11
about the capital structures which is debt and equity. Balance sheet is good
16:15
enough to talk about the investments in the business. Balance sheet is good
16:18
enough to talk about how much money is stuck in working capital versus my fixed
16:21
capital those kind of stuff. So uh you you you know there's fellow called as
16:25
Jackma Jackma the out of the three uh generally
16:29
you know leaders don't kind of say and he's pretty good pretty eloquent leader
16:33
that way. He said I don't like looking at P&L and cash flows. I like looking at
16:38
balance sheet more. You know why? Because he said it tells me what am I
16:42
left with. That's what his answer was. That tells
16:45
me what am I left with all said and done. So when somebody let's say is at
16:49
war. It is not important how many soldiers did you kill or how many of
16:53
yours were killed. What is important is how many are you left with? Because you
16:58
have to go to the war tomorrow as well. That's the thing with balance sheet.
17:01
It's not just a business for one year that you're doing. In case you're
17:04
serious about it and your business picks up, you're going to continue the
17:07
business forever. So every day or every month end or every quarter end, you must
17:11
figure out what are you left with for tomorrow. We do it all the time as
17:15
households. Don't you think we look at always our bank balance, how much money
17:18
are we left with? That's looking at a balance sheet perspective. Are you with
17:23
me on that? Okay. All right. So we are going to begin today's case and to to be
17:28
able to kind of reach to the pinnacle, you have to do some warming up.
17:31
Everybody make sense of these eight transactions. Anything that you don't
17:34
understand, time to ask is now. Just go through the transactions.
18:20
And once you have gone through all of them, I want somebody to explain
18:25
transaction number two to me. Oh,
18:31
I think it just went in. It just got fitted.
18:34
Fantastic. Somebody explain transaction number two.
18:42
Rest is rest are very easy. Raising money from equity, bank balance going
18:48
up, purchasing machinery, bank going down. This is simple stuff. Below your
18:52
pay grade transaction number two, somebody volunteer.
18:56
Come on. This is a safe space. Why are you taking so much pressure?
19:00
Take it easy. Yes. H. You say more. You bought the goods
19:09
from first.
19:14
You are always right in your first attempt and not so right in your second
19:17
attempt. This is the second time that it happened. Yesterday also I think you
19:21
started so strong but then you got something. Oh my god. Oh my god. And
19:25
then you ended so weak. Come on. You were so right. Come on everybody.
19:28
Anybody else? Anybody else?
19:39
Accounting is easy. Understanding business is difficult. So I want you to
19:42
do the difficult thing first. Go ahead. Um Myra
19:49
very good to buy goods.
19:52
Fantastic. That means how many business associate is uh being dealt with? Two.
19:58
The business goes to the bank first, borrows money. How much cash inflow
20:03
comes in? 10,000. And there is an obligation to
20:06
the bank because you made a promise. I'll pay back. And then you come home
20:10
and then you decide, oh my god, why did I take the loan? To buy the goods. You
20:13
went to the supplier. You paid cash and bought the goods. Are you with me on
20:18
that? My question to all of you is is this cash purchase or is this credit
20:22
purchase of goods? Is this cash purchase of goods or is
20:27
this credit purchase of goods? Come on, you are purchasing the goods
20:33
for your venture. Is this cash purchase or credit purchase?
20:38
Who is giving credit to you? The bank. But who are you purchasing the
20:43
goods from? Suppliers. Is supplier giving credit to
20:46
you? No, it's a cash purchase.
20:50
Can I therefore come to a conclusion that for a business the bank funding and
20:55
supplier credit are a substitute of each other.
20:59
I either take the funding from the bank and go to the supplier with cash loads
21:04
of money. No credit required then or if the bank says no then I go to the
21:09
supplier saying please please please give me your goods and I will pay later.
21:12
Can I say that the bank funding and operational credits are substitutes of
21:16
each other? Are you with me on that? All right. Now these are the things that you
21:21
have to now this is not accounting. This is a dimension of a business that
21:24
perhaps is understanding is required to do accounting. Well people accounting is
21:29
something which is reflection of what you're doing on the ground. That
21:33
understanding is primary. Never be in a hurry to calculate bank balance. Never
21:37
be in a hurry to calculate profit balance. Always understand what is
21:40
happening here. So for example point uh number
21:47
eight has liquidity gone down has
21:51
profitability gone down has neither gone down or has both gone down? Point number
21:57
eight. Has liquidity gone down?
22:07
No. Why do you think liquidity doesn't go down?
22:09
No cash flow. No cash flow. That's it. Brilliant. Has
22:12
profitability gone down? Profitability goes down when you consume. Super. When
22:18
you consume, you've consumed 120 worth of services, distribution guy, and you
22:22
know some legal charges. So $120 is going to hit your profit. So profits go
22:27
down. Are you with me on that? That's the basic understanding is what you
22:31
need. All right, everybody. Now what I want you to do and you can work in
22:35
groups of course. Um there's the same case that we will continue in the post
22:40
learn session also. So please make sure that you are not working only on the
22:44
phone. You take pen paper, you take a laptop, you do tab, you do whatever. But
22:49
because I want you to keep the same details in the second phase today like
22:53
in the this class itself and then post lunch when we meet same case is going to
22:57
be built up. So it's not enough to say oh I just on a calculator I just
23:01
calculated the right bank balance. No, today you'll have to kind of work on a
23:05
longish case. That's why we need two classes for that. So a good time to
23:09
finish this case is 2 hours. We have three. So think about it. We can finish
23:13
both the classes 30 minutes sooner. Do you get the math? Total time that you
23:18
require is 2 hours. I wish if there was one class for 2 hours, I can finish the
23:22
entire you know this thing in one single shot. By chance of class 10 is 90
23:26
minutes and stuff like that. There are cahoots etc so on so forth. Anyway um
23:30
everybody how much time do you think you need for calculating bank balance? Tell
23:34
me in minutes. Take 10. And to calculate the profit
23:41
balance another 10 is like and then quantity
23:47
discount 10 + 10 tick tick 15. Okay. In 15 minutes would you be able to
23:54
calculate both the bank balance and the profit balance everybody? But I have a
23:58
request. Please write the numbers on a pen paper so that in case there is an
24:02
error you know where to correct just just calculators won't work today. Let's
24:07
work on the bank balance first. All of us are calculating the bank balance
24:11
first. How much is don't make full cash flow statement. CFO
24:18
CFI CF we don't need that. We just need you to write the cash transactions and
24:24
the bank balance. Okay, let's go everybody.
24:32
First 10 minutes are to 10, five, whatever it takes.
24:36
Is there a Is there a
24:38
No. Enzo templates are below your pay grade
24:47
now. Okay.
24:49
Of course, that was so just for the first two classes.
24:51
So, we need to do the bank balance.
24:55
only the balances but with some numbers in like let's say 4,800 plus 3,000 minus
25:01
those kind of things. People you can work in groups so that
25:06
you can nudge each other. This is a safe space to create mistakes.
26:11
So you put a plus 10 and you put a minus 10. Yeah, both.
26:29
Done. Done.
26:32
Bank balance. Yeah. How much? 9. Very good. I got the profit balance now.
26:39
Those who have finished the bank balance. Move to the profit balance.
26:51
We got some What are you doing?
27:45
Uh but 40% of tickets purchased were sold at a profit.
27:50
Mhm. 20%
27:53
credit. Credit that means the customer did not
27:55
give you cash. The customer gave you a promise to pay later.
27:59
Ah okay. Okay. Okay. And the profit margin is 20%. Thank you so much.
28:48
We both have a question about the 40% goods in the profit part. Will we
28:53
consider them like 4 40% which is basically 4,000
29:00
we add that to the profit balance. So uh who are you?
29:04
Krishna that's the mistake you're doing
29:09
business from business standpoint don't think
29:12
from a standpoint I do of course
29:19
this is profit or the bank
29:28
what happens when you let's say you give free sample to your beloved professor So
29:34
you already so will that transaction involve cash
29:40
outflow because we already bought it at first.
29:44
Oh okay. I will reduce your inventory balance.
29:47
So what I did was profit and lo basically
29:50
more or less. So you kind of mixed the two.
29:53
What goes out of the system either it is cash or it is profit. You have kind of
29:59
mixed the two right now. So think with a clear mentality. only focus on the cash
30:03
balance. The list will be shorter. Only think of
30:07
my profit balance list will be shorter. Okay?
30:11
But but don't forget free sample to your beloved professor.
30:19
Welcome to marketing. Yes. Answer. Very good. Bank.
30:25
Good. 99. And this is not right.
30:31
Is this right? This
30:38
is normal when it's not considered as a like loss.
30:46
It is a loss. It's a loss and it's like a normal loss,
30:50
but you nonetheless it is a loss. Okay.
30:52
So you still write 500 as a loss. Could you give me a hint first?
30:56
Yeah. Could you give me a hint? This income
31:00
site is grossly wrong. Yes ma'am. Income is what you do with the customer.
31:07
Very good. This one
31:11
income statement. Yeah. What is coming as loss?
31:26
There is one transaction that you've done at profit.
31:33
Yeah. So that's what happens in a startup. Hardly any sale. All expenses
31:38
only. Okay. Whatever it is.
31:45
No. as well. Is
31:53
that correct? Uh this is short by 2000.
31:58
Think about free sample. Imagine that this product is your drop
32:02
shipping product and you give that free to me as a sample.
32:08
Oh yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. It's not like cash flow.
32:14
Correct. Correct. Sorry.
32:22
So you got a machinery that's equipment, right? Right. But it doesn't look like
32:27
this purchase this year but like last year because it says after us one year.
32:33
So in terms of um you purchase the machinery on the
32:38
first day of the current year and after one full year is worth 9,000 only. Now
32:43
this is the first year of the business. Yeah. And since it's only bank balance,
32:46
do you also calculate equipment depreciation?
32:51
Focus on ah good point. Focus on the bank. Any transaction which reduces your
32:56
bank should come in is not going to come in.
32:59
That's the point. That's the point. No.
33:13
Okay. So hold some questions. So we have office hours today 6:00 to 7:00
33:18
and uh you know we can have some uh just in
33:22
case you're missing some classes if you can just watch the recordings of it you
33:26
can just create some summary that will be nice. Let's meet no problem.
33:33
Bank balance right or wrong doesn't matter today. Uh one of
33:39
bank balance is right. Well done. Profits. Profit. You're very close.
33:43
You're very, very close. Think about it. The goods that you're
33:49
purchasing, have you consumed all the goods?
33:53
Therefore, why are you as an expense? Expense is always the consumption.
34:03
Everybody those who have got the bank balance 990
34:08
should move to the profit balance 9900 is the bank balance
34:19
bank balance is 9900 that's the final all said and done what
34:26
are you left with in the bank 9 0 0.
34:38
That's okay. By practice. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Let's do it together.
34:49
Um no
34:57
bank balance. No, I gave my money to this.
35:00
I am not going to do it. I am more lazy than what you think. I am here only to
35:05
collect free samples. All right.
35:08
Uh so this is what we do. This is the purchase of goods.
35:12
Very good. Uh also free samples.
35:14
But when you give free sample, are you paying cash to that person or is the
35:20
inventory going out? Is it the inventory is going out? But
35:22
you already paid for that. That's it. So that you have already
35:25
included in 10. H then I don't put it. Then you don't
35:27
have to put it again. Okay. It's stolen minus 5.
35:31
Was was money from your wallet stolen or was good stolen?
35:34
Was stolen. Therefore, why are you subtracting it?
35:38
You have to focus on one thing. Your bank balance. Not everything which is
35:42
happening in the business. Bank interest.
35:45
That's it. That's it. But it's an outflow. So, put it in negative.
35:49
Okay. Okay. Machinery. Brilliant. Brilliant.
35:54
Really? This is what we asked for. Superb. Superb.
35:57
Now, now Oh, now he's good. 99 0. That's it. That's it.
36:03
That's it. Just go logical. Okay. Enzo, come on. The world has got the bank
36:09
balance. You can't let it go. How many people could not get 990? Could
36:16
not get 990. That's okay. That's all right. Okay.
36:22
Okay. 20,000
36:26
and I also have 10,000. So the sum is 10,000,000.
36:34
Hang on. Yes. 3,000. What is 3,000 as a transaction?
36:38
Uh it's an expense. Expense. But are you calculating profit
36:41
or are you calculating the bank balance? Bank balance.
36:45
So when you pay 3,000 goods of words to somebody, that is not a cash outflow.
36:51
That is your inventory going down. Cash has already gone down when you paid
36:56
for the inventory. So,000 again you are double counting,000
37:02
was distributed. Distributed. I see. Correct. There was not the money that
37:07
you had you are giving. It's just the goods that you're giving. So right now
37:10
your focus is on the bank balance. Note only the transactions where the bank is
37:14
impacted. All right. Okay. Got it. Me and her both are getting
37:20
net 80. Positive or negative? 3,920.
37:37
Can you all four come together and solve out? Because there are two people who
37:41
are getting the right answer. Two getting the wrong answer. I won't tell
37:44
you whether you two are right or you two are right. Well, one of the answer is
37:48
right. So now it's only
37:59
for right. So think about it. 50 and 70. Have you made the payment?
38:03
Uh no. Yes. But it was due. It was due. They were they were due for
38:08
payment. Has not been paid. Which means you have consumed somebody's
38:13
service, but you have not paid for them. No. So the bank has not paid out
38:20
anything to them. It was just due. They are still due.
38:26
Yeah. It's yet to be paid. So you remove that amount as well from the bank
38:29
statement. Aisha,
38:33
how are you getting stuck? You are the balance.
38:48
and then worry about but I thought the revenue
38:54
100% so you can always like you know separately it's maybe like a little more
38:58
extra work but getting the cash first is always
39:02
going to put things clear in your head okay everybody let's see are you getting
39:11
these numbers 3 920
39:15
loss 3 920 of loss.
39:21
Yes. People the PPD is with you. So that you
39:34
know if we toggle around here and you are on a let's say uh one step back you
39:38
can always refer to the PPT. This has been uploaded as in session for uh in
39:42
session material uh for I think today's session session 8.
39:48
Okay, everybody figure out where your answer does not
39:52
match mine. Why is it important to write these two
40:03
in spite of the fact that it is cancelelling each other? The debt
40:06
funding from Abu Dhabi Bank plus 10,000 and then making payment to the
40:11
suppliers, they cancel out each other. Right? This was a transaction number two
40:15
that I was trying to explain. Why is it still important to write both of them?
40:20
Why can't we just write a zero rather than writing a plus 10 and a minus 10?
40:26
Because both are of different nature. When you raise money from bank, this is
40:32
operating, investing or financing? Financing. When you make payment to
40:35
suppliers, it is operating. Fantastic. Both are different
40:40
heads. So CFF goes up, CFO goes down. Net cash balance is still a zero. I
40:47
understand. But different heads show different numbers.
40:51
Everybody, you have a minute or so to be on the same page.
41:14
A lot of you a lot of you missed out on the first line item of expense here
41:22
because you're selling goods worth 4,800. Then the cost of goods will also
41:27
come as an expense. Right? That is something that a lot of you
41:31
missed out and therefore you are getting an 80 plus. 80 worth of profit. The cost
41:36
of the goods that you're selling is also an expense.
41:40
Another mistake that I found in general was many of you have written goods
41:44
purchased 10,000. Tell me is goods purchased an expense. Why not?
41:51
Because because we did not use all of them.
41:55
Only the portions that you're consuming are the expense. You used goods in three
42:00
manner. Number one, you sold some of them.
42:04
You sold some of them 4,000. You gave them as free samples.
42:11
You gave them as free samples 3,000. And some goods got stolen. That means three
42:17
situations. Situation 1, 2 and three, inventory is going down. Look at the
42:24
inventory balance. Inventory balance will go down. Right? But these three are
42:29
different nature in altogether. These three are different transactions. I am
42:32
the happiest when my product cost of goods sold goes up because you see it
42:36
tells me that I'm selling more. But I am not very happy when somebody steals my
42:40
good and I am I have a mixed feeling when I have to spend on marketing. Is
42:45
marketing expense a good idea? It's a bad idea. Any expense is a bad
42:51
idea? Think about it. Coca-Cola doesn't market much. Nvidia does not market
42:56
much. Their product sells, you know, without marketing as well. But a lot of
43:00
weak products have to market a lot. So marketing what is the main purpose of
43:04
marketing as an expense to increase to increase sales to generate demand. You
43:09
generate demand only when there is none. You see the point? So don't think any
43:13
expenses. Oh my god, thank god there is marketing in my life. No, it's very bad
43:16
idea. You should have only profits in your life and profits go up only when
43:20
expenses go down. All expenses should be as low as possible. Think of it that
43:24
way. Think from a businessman's point of view. People, you're not doing business
43:28
for joy. You're doing business to generate wealth. Don't forget this line.
43:32
Wealth may be next week. Wealth may be next year. Wealth may be after 5 years.
43:36
But wealth has to be focused upon. Today we are going to focus a lot upon the
43:40
wealth. All right people, you have 30 more seconds to please update your
43:43
answers in written to these numbers. Whether you're on soft copy, whether
43:48
you're on hard copy, So
44:05
by chance by chance you know so that just to know that in case there would
44:08
have been that also comes as an expense I could have removed it also.
44:14
Sorted everybody move on. Okay now all said and done
44:20
all said and done I'm just boring you to death. All said and done, this is the
44:25
tagline for balance sheet. All said and done, what are the leftovers?
44:31
How much assets are you left with? And is there an obligation on your head that
44:36
you are left with all said and done? So tell me without worrying about the
44:41
accounting, what are the resources that you're left with? Give me the names of
44:44
the resources. 6,000 worth of goods. How? How? How?
44:50
Total 10,000 were 10,000 is what you had purchased. Four goes here, three goes
44:57
here and 500 goes here. Only 2500 worth of goods are left. Right? I'm not
45:04
interested in the valuation right now. I'm only interested in the names. So can
45:08
you tell me everybody what are the leftovers?
45:12
Jackma remembering JMA. Whenever you talk about
45:16
balance sheet, remember Jackma. This guy is fanatic about the balance sheet. They
45:19
say I can see where my money is coming and going. I can see what am I left
45:22
with. I have to fight every day a new war. So I must know my leftovers. How
45:26
many resources are you left with? And how many obligations are you left
45:34
with? I want the names of these. What are the
45:39
resources that you are left with? Somebody said inventory.
45:44
No, don't give me the values. Just tell me the resources.
45:48
Very good. What else? No, no. Resources.
45:56
What are you left with? Fee payment is an obligation. Okay. So, let me write it
46:00
here. Fees and distribution. What else are you left with? What are the pending
46:05
balances? Pending businesses. Cash balance.
46:08
Cash balance. Fantastic. And what are you left with that you can use tomorrow?
46:13
Oh, equity is not what you're left with. Equity is a residual. You're always left
46:17
with resource or an obligation. We got
46:21
We got machinery. We got cash. We got inventory. Anything else that you're
46:24
left with? Receivables.
46:26
Receivables. Very good. Who are receivables?
46:32
Credit sales. The credit customers. Those are the people who purchase goods
46:36
from me and gave me what? Promise. Not cash. They gave me promise.
46:43
All right. Is there any other obligation on head of the business? any commitment.
46:47
Very good. The bank loan, the first Abu Dhabi bank
46:54
is equity also an obligation. Is equity also an obligation? The point
47:02
it depends upon what are the terms of conditions of raising money. So when you
47:06
raise money from debt, what did you give to them? A promise to pay back. But when
47:11
you raise money from equity, you never give them a promise to pay back. There
47:14
is no commitment to equity. There is only dilution of ownership. There was
47:19
nothing to give. The I told equity you become my owner itself. Whatever surplus
47:23
I make belongs to you. Whatever decisions I have to take I will ask from
47:27
you. That's what I give to equity. I never give any commitment to equity.
47:32
Okay. All right. So everybody can you take like 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 2
47:36
minutes to give numbers to each of these and give me the sum totals of resources
47:43
and obligations. All said and done, what are you left
47:48
with? If you open,
48:26
are you punching it down? because you'll have to move to the second year also. So
48:30
then you'll need those numbers with you. Everybody please make sure that you
48:35
punch these numbers down either hard copy or soft copy.
49:11
the leftovers which I can use tomorrow. How much is the bank balance that I'm
49:16
left with? How much is the bank balance? I'm left
49:20
with 9,900.
49:22
9,900. We just calculated the bank balance.
49:31
Sorry. Receivable. Receivable are those
49:35
customers to whom I sold. They did not give me the money at that moment, but
49:40
they gave me the promise. They're still pending. Absolutely. So
49:44
these are the people whose money is spending that I need to receive.
49:52
How much inventory are you left with? 2500.
49:56
2500. Very good. Where has 7500 gone? Some sold, some
50:02
stolen, and some given as free samples. Okay. All three of them. Uh,
50:08
nonetheless, the inventory has go, you know, goes down. Okay. Machinery. What's
50:14
the value of machinery? Oh, I thought you purchased it for
50:17
10iations for 1,000.
50:20
That means the machinery is now no more brand new. Machinery is a slightly used
50:24
machinery like a 9,000. You see people it is important to figure out where are
50:30
you standing? Because somebody ask a question what is left over? You always
50:35
ask a question when at what point in time are you asking me? A minute ago
50:40
something else was left over and maybe a minute later something else will be left
50:43
over. During that minute I must have gained something or lost something. So
50:47
it's always important may I ask this point is this the photograph or
50:51
videograph that you're making? Is this a videograph or a photograph that you're
50:56
making? What is left over? Photo or video?
51:03
This is photo. Imagine students are dispersing after the break and there are
51:09
some students in the room and then Gimma comes and say how many students are left
51:14
in the room now this is a static question at the moment how many I can
51:18
click a picture but maybe a minute ago there were more in the room maybe a
51:22
minute later there will be less in the room because continuously the business
51:24
is making transactions some things are coming in some things are going in
51:27
assets are getting exchanged liabilities are being taken incomes are getting
51:31
generated expenses are being consumed there is a live body on the
51:35
So therefore, this is a photograph that you take at this very moment. What am I
51:41
left with? And how much is a receivable? Very good. 4,800 worth of uh promise.
51:48
Somebody's promise is still due. So how much is the total resources?
51:54
26200. 26 200.
52:01
And what is the obligation? any burden on your head to pay to
52:06
somebody? You need to pay to the bank how much?
52:12
Why do you have to pay to the bank? 10,000?
52:13
Because you took a We took a loan. That's why. Okay. Oh,
52:17
have you paid the interest? Yes.
52:18
Oh, yeah. Okay. So, interest is not an obligation. So, bank loan 10,000.
52:24
And is there any other thing that you have to Yeah. Somebody said fees and
52:28
legal fees and distribution 120. So far so good.
52:35
And therefore the total obligation that we have is 1 0 1 2 0.
52:48
All said and done jackma all said and done we are left with resources 26200
52:55
which I can use tomorrow and I have an obligation of 10,120
53:00
that I have to pay tomorrow. That is at this very moment where I'm standing at
53:05
the end of the first year. Is this point clear so far? What is this
53:12
statement communicating? This is not communicating the flows of cash.
53:18
That's cash flow statement. This is not communicating how much profit did you
53:22
make? That's income statement. This is only communicating a simple point. What
53:27
are you left with? This statement is called as a balance
53:31
sheet. A balance sheet is like the tagline is all said and done what is
53:36
left over. So on one hand you have all the resources and on the other you have
53:41
some obligations. Are we together on that? All right. Now everybody um I want
53:48
to again go and pick up pick up somebody's light bag. Uh can I
53:54
pick your bag for a minute? What was this?
54:00
The business. What is the size of the business? What is the size of the
54:05
business? Pick up a number. What is the size of the business?
54:11
26,200. Fantastic. This is the weight of the
54:15
business. This is the size of the business. These are the resources in the
54:19
business. And when I somebody enters the of the business and say what do I see?
54:25
How many resources do I see? Four. I see some bank balance lying
54:29
there. I see some machinery lying there. I see some inventory lying there. And I
54:32
also see some receivables. But the total weight of the bag is
54:36
26,200. Think of business as a bag in which everybody puts in money. There is
54:41
a lot of activity that happens and then the bag becomes heavier or lighter. So
54:45
stay with me. The right now the weight of the bag is 26 to 100. Okay. How much
54:50
does the bag need to pay to outsiders under the commitment?
54:58
You have already worked done the hard work. Now is the reading time. Read the
55:02
number. How much is the bag need to pay to outsiders?
55:06
10,120. Where will the bag pay from?
55:11
resources they have so many resources 26,000 worth of resources right and I
55:16
have to pay how much 10,000 something of resources can you tell me if in case
55:20
hypothetically bank the bank bag is not paying that but I'm saying
55:23
hypothetically if it is assumed that bag pays all obligations how much will the
55:29
bag be left with can you calculate the difference between the two
55:35
1680 is the value of resources that will be
55:41
left in the bag in case all obligations are paid. Correct? This 16,80 of
55:47
resources will belong to whom? The owners. That's what is owner's money
55:54
in the bag. Owner's money in the bag is not 26200.
55:59
2600 is the total money in the bag always. Somebody else have also helped
56:05
you to create the size of the bag like a bank. So that means you owners can't say
56:09
the bank's money is also my money. Bank's money is bank's money. So all of
56:14
that money is in the bag. This bag overall belongs to equity. I understand.
56:18
But equity does not own every bit of it. You have to pay to outsiders first.
56:23
That's the contractual obligation that equity has. So therefore out of 26,200
56:28
how much money belongs to equity? That's the first thing that we got to calculate
56:32
which is nothing but the difference of the two. So
56:36
value of equity, this is where you come in is going to be the total money in the
56:44
bag minus the money that I need to pay to
56:49
the outsiders. 16080. You know who calculates this 16080
56:56
all the time while the business is on? All the time. Every day somebody
57:01
calculates this 16080. Who is that? The owner.
57:06
Because employees are only concerned, you hire a driver, they're only
57:09
concerned about their salary. You hire a supplier, they're only concerned about
57:13
the payment. You hire a customer, I mean sell to a customer, customer is only
57:17
worried about the quality. Who is interested about you? Nobody. Only you
57:22
are interested about you. Government is only interested about the taxes that
57:26
they collect from you. All of the different stakeholders are not
57:31
interested about 16080. There is one person who is which is you. You when you
57:38
do the business I'm not saying you don't look at these totals. I'm not saying you
57:41
disregard all of what I'm saying is you have to also take into account that
57:45
there is one household that you have to also feed which is yours. So I'm going
57:49
to pick up an an brilliant example of something a business called as airlines.
57:55
Okay. Airlines is a brilliant business model but for only the business
57:59
associates. The companies who supply oil make wonderful money. The employees,
58:05
pilots and crew members make wonderful salaries. The taxes the airport charges
58:10
that airlines pay to the airports are wonderfully high. That means everybody
58:16
else is making money from airline businesses except the owners of the
58:20
airline. So how do you become a millionaire fastest? become a
58:24
billionaire first and open an airline, your wealth quickly drops to let's say
58:30
it's a it's a proven business model which does not make money for the owners
58:34
of the airline. Airbus and Boeing they sell the planes to the airlines Airbus
58:39
and Boeing makes money. It's just that the main person who is holding everybody
58:44
together that is not making money. bad business to be in.
58:50
Ego, you know, the more you seasoned you become as an entrepreneur, you you
58:54
realize that good businesses are one which are uh run with lack of emotion.
58:59
Why does your first business generally is not the airline? Because you haven't
59:04
got that ego kick so far. Once you know earn money from somewhere, let's say
59:09
Kingfisher airline is a classic example. Kingfisher Airlines earned a lot of
59:12
money from breweries and alcohols and spirits etc. And then the ego comes in
59:16
and then say I'm going to open an airline also. You see it's such a in a
59:20
social club it's such a power statement that I own not the cars but the planes.
59:26
So that's the ego part of it. And I'm not saying all airlines do bad. Uh
59:30
Singapore Airlines is one of the few examples which have made consistent
59:33
money every time. That means they must be doing something good. But in general
59:37
airlines is a very bad business model to be in. Very very bad business model to
59:41
be in. But anyway, you don't have to have that business model in your thing.
59:45
So, you got to make sure that your number of equity is always on your
59:48
radar. Next way to calculate equity, may I ask
59:52
you a few questions and can you answer it using the case? How much money did
59:57
you put in at the beginning of the year in the bag?
1:00:02
20,000. And what did the bag generate for you?
1:00:08
A loss of how much? 3 920. Uh, won't employees share that
1:00:15
loss? Won't supplier share that loss? Won't bank share that loss? Won't
1:00:20
government share this loss? And you thought all of them are yours. Nobody is
1:00:24
going to share that loss should you get into a loss. People think about it. All
1:00:28
business associates are very very emotionless. Everybody connects with you
1:00:33
in order to generate profit not for you but for themsel.
1:00:37
To put it very very bluntly, I prefer to come to Tetar not because Tetar makes
1:00:42
good money but because the the compensation that is given to me is
1:00:47
good. Emit has rented out the place to tetar
1:00:51
not because they love Tetar but because Em but the rent is good. Are you with me
1:00:55
on that? Every business associate thinks like that. So how much is the loss that
1:00:59
they have incurred? 3 920 and therefore their wealth becomes lower. Jakma, what
1:01:08
are we left with? A lower wealth than what we began. If your closing position
1:01:13
is poor than the opening position, what can you say about the performance?
1:01:17
Performance must have been bad. Only then your position have worsened. Are
1:01:22
you with me on that? And this 3 920 everybody which is also
1:01:29
was reflected in the in the loss here 3 920 this is essentially called as please
1:01:36
write it down somewhere wealth destruction
1:01:42
the loss that you generate destroys the wealth whose wealth by the way sorry
1:01:47
whose wealth that's the point so you hand over you
1:01:51
see doing businesses therefore we say it's risky you're giving putting your
1:01:54
20,000 in hands of somebody else and that somebody else the business can
1:01:58
either grow it or it can destroy it. So that's why we say doing business is
1:02:05
risky quote unquote risky salary is still safer. You go to the office you
1:02:10
are working for yourself and that's about it. Here so many people are
1:02:13
working for you. If employee goofs up you lose. If supplier goofs up you lose.
1:02:18
If customer doesn't come in you lose. If government screws you up then you lose.
1:02:22
Everybody can screw you up. So therefore, for you to be able to make a
1:02:25
profitable business, million things should come right at a time. It's not
1:02:30
like Tesla make good cars. It's not that only steering is good, seats are not.
1:02:34
It's not that seats are good, tires are not. All of the things have to be good.
1:02:38
So while we were discussing with one of the, you know, drop shipping ventures
1:02:41
that they have a product, only having a good product is not enough. You need to
1:02:46
have multiple dimensions of the thing all working together back to back to be
1:02:51
able to successfully run that business. Accounting only gives you a mirror
1:02:55
image. So if your business is ugly like how ugly the business is, it will show
1:02:59
up an ugly image. What to do? This is the first time you and I are doing a
1:03:03
ugly business. So far all businesses have done fantastic profits. Are we
1:03:07
together on that everybody? Okay, moving to the next. Have you written the well
1:03:11
destruction? Uh can you make some sense? This is
1:03:17
something a repeat of what we did day before yesterday or I think yesterday we
1:03:22
did it. You see the same loss of 3920 but I'm writing it sequentially
1:03:29
today cahoot's question if depreciation goes up
1:03:34
will your gross profit be impacted? No. Will your earning before interest tax
1:03:39
and depreciation be impacted? No. But your operating profit will be impacted
1:03:43
because depreciation comes before that. So that's the sequential bit of it. And
1:03:47
there is still some goodness in it. This is the advantage of making a sequential
1:03:52
income statement that rather than saying oh my loss is 3920. Everything I've done
1:03:56
is wrong. You have to understand everything you did is not wrong. The
1:04:00
sales were made at a profit something good. It's just that the marketing
1:04:04
expense and all of those were a little more lossmaking. Okay. All right.
1:04:10
You have already made it and that is well done. Everybody I want you to
1:04:13
scribble this framework down. When
1:04:19
whenever after 3 months 2 months you will be neck deep into your business and
1:04:24
sometimes you get that you know feeling of being lost.
1:04:29
My request is just make this framework fill in the numbers and it will give you
1:04:33
a very good summary of what has happened till date.
1:04:37
Frameworks always help you to understand complicated constructs.
1:04:43
Okay, let me know once you have this framework written. Those who are on soft
1:04:48
copies have to click the picture maybe import it and then scribble.
1:05:01
How you going to do it on phone? I want to see. I'm very curious to know.
1:05:17
Whenever you are lost, try and use this framework. It will give you a lot of
1:05:21
sense as to where is my money in the business
1:05:30
and people because you most of you have not started your businesses. Therefore,
1:05:34
you will appreciate the value of this framework once you are neck deep into it
1:05:38
and confused what am I doing man you know since beginning to the end I have
1:05:42
been selling selling selling buying buying buying but where am I in my
1:05:46
business this is a framework that will help you so let's get the numbers have
1:05:50
you written it everybody okay just take 30 more seconds
1:05:58
today you need to do a lot of reading of numbers also Oh.
1:06:24
All right. What is the total size of the business right now at the moment? Total
1:06:30
size of the business. Pick up a number from the board.
1:06:34
26,200. That's the total size of the business. But hey, business have
1:06:38
resources of 26200. But business cannot print money. Unlike central bank,
1:06:43
Federal Reserve, etc. They can't print their own money. That means somebody
1:06:46
would have given this money to them. Who are the people who have given the money
1:06:49
to them? This is the other side. The two always have to be equal to each other.
1:06:55
Because let's say X rupees is what the business have received. X is what they
1:07:00
can buy stuff from. Imagine you are empty pocket right now and during the
1:07:04
lunch time somebody gives you 10 dirhams to go and buy something. What is the
1:07:07
maximum value for which you can buy? 10. The two sides have to be equal to each
1:07:11
other. Oh, that's why we call it balance sheet because the two have to balance
1:07:15
out each other. That's the name balance sheet. But anyway, the total resources
1:07:19
owned by the business is 26,200. Is it a photograph or a videograph?
1:07:24
What are you left with? Photograph or a videograph? photograph. Maybe a minute
1:07:29
ago, machinery was something else. Maybe a minute later, inventory was something
1:07:32
else. This is at the after year one. Somebody is clicking a picture, a
1:07:38
photograph. Okay. So far so good. All right. How
1:07:43
much are the obligations on the head? Some money came from these two people.
1:07:48
Some money came from First Abu Dhabi Bank. How much money came from First Abu
1:07:53
Dhabi Bank? 10,000. Very good. And some help came
1:07:58
from my operational suppliers. How much help came from operational suppliers?
1:08:05
How much help came from operational suppliers?
1:08:08
120. Very good people. What is the difference between these two? Both have
1:08:13
obligations. But one is operating in nature, the other one is
1:08:20
financing in nature. Remember OI and F that we did both are obligations. You
1:08:25
need to pay to both and therefore I am clubbing both of them into 1 0 1 2 0.
1:08:32
So the narrative goes as follows. How much is total money in the bag? Total
1:08:37
money in the bag 26. And how much is the bag owing to somebody else?
1:08:42
That means the money that must be belonging to owners has to be the
1:08:47
residual. That's what the residual is always the
1:08:52
owner's money. The host of the party. So imagine you have some friends coming
1:08:55
over and you have ordered some pizza. How much pizza do you get to eat? You're
1:09:01
not going to be the first one to pick up a slice. As a gracious host, you will
1:09:05
always allow the guest to eat first and whatever remains more or less belongs to
1:09:11
you. So has it ever happened that you have a feeling yeah yesterday in my
1:09:15
party I was not able to have anything. My guest only consumed everything.
1:09:19
That's a situation where in a business equity value is zero. Everything is
1:09:23
taken by outsiders. Okay. Anyway, now equity is surprised. All of you are
1:09:28
surprised. How did my wealth become 1680 at the moment? You started with 20,
1:09:35
correct? How much is the income that you generated?
1:09:42
How much is the income that you generated?
1:09:45
That's a profit. How much is the income that you generated?
1:09:50
4800. That's your income. And that's your delivery. That's your dealing with
1:09:53
customers. That's your sales. That's your output. Somebody let's say you know
1:09:57
once your ventures are on Pratam will ask this very question. How much is your
1:10:01
revenue? Is he asking about the net profit or is he asking about the sales
1:10:06
to the customers? That's it. Your profit may still be loss
1:10:10
but the revenue is like how many times have you interacted with customers?
1:10:13
You're dealing with customers. Are you with me on that? Okay. So your uh
1:10:18
revenue your incomes are 4,800. Can you pick up a handphone everybody?
1:10:22
Handphone. And very quickly, can you add the
1:10:25
numbers that I'm telling you? 4,000
1:10:30
+ 3,000 + 50
1:10:37
+ 500 + 70
1:10:42
+ 1,000 + 100.
1:10:48
These are all your expenses that you have already included. How much is the
1:10:51
number you're getting? 8,000.
1:10:54
8,000. Okay. All right. So, your income was
1:10:59
during the year 4800 worth of revenue and 8,720
1:11:05
worth of expenses. Both of them resulted into a loss of 3920.
1:11:14
In yesterday's case, promoters came to withdraw how much money?
1:11:19
600. Can the promoter withdraw any profit? No. Why not?
1:11:24
There is no profit. I can't eat the cake right now because there is no cake in
1:11:28
the room. So that's the point. The dividends are zero in this case. So how
1:11:32
much is the balance in the reserves? -3920.
1:11:37
people equity is such a serious business to get in because all the losses doesn't
1:11:43
matter who the reason was but the losses will come on your account. You know this
1:11:48
equity called up these suppliers, advocates and distribution guys. They
1:11:52
say can you share some loss? They said no. Equity called up these bankers can
1:11:57
you share some loss? They said no. You see all the losses doesn't matter who
1:12:01
the reason is uh is always on the account of equity. And therefore a
1:12:04
20,000 plus uh 3920's loss is going to get you the 16,80.
1:12:10
Are we together? How much is the size of the business?
1:12:14
What your answer is going to be? 2600. Very good. How much is the
1:12:18
obligation to outsiders? 1,120. And how much is owner's worth is 1680.
1:12:24
Are we together everybody? Don't take any pressure. 30 second of
1:12:30
processing the information. I'm going to show you the last slide after this.
1:12:37
Today is a mature class. Some every class is not like that. Yesterday class
1:12:41
was so simple cash flow statement like inflow outflow below your pay grade. You
1:12:44
know yesterday honestly I had a feeling that I think I wasted everybody's time
1:12:48
because it was too easy for everybody is like simple inflows and simple outflows
1:12:53
you are more mature than that today is a class where I am telling you that even
1:12:57
if you don't understand don't unnecessarily take stress this is
1:13:00
something which businessmen take time to absorb but one day it has to happen and
1:13:07
for that one day to happen somebody has to go to do the start this is the start
1:13:11
today are you with me on that different classes will have different concepts.
1:13:15
Okay, everybody, are you ready? Anybody want to crack a joke to make the
1:13:20
mood lighter? I see a lot of dense air in the room. Take it easy. Relax. It's
1:13:25
okay. Nobody's dying. There is going to be tomorrow sun outside, bright shallow,
1:13:29
sunny day. You know my manager at EY. So, we used to sometimes had heated
1:13:34
argument with clients. They pay us to find out faults. How funny consulting
1:13:38
is. Somebody invites you to find out fault in themselves and then pay you
1:13:42
money as well. So anyway, you know, we would go happily, you know, tie suit
1:13:46
etc. uh kind of scrutinize, ask questions, etc., etc. Sometimes it was
1:13:51
very heated argument and then my boss had a very good go-to balcony strategy.
1:13:56
And what do you mean by go to balcony strategy? Meaning mentally you just
1:13:59
think that you go out of the room and now you're looking at a mountain with a
1:14:02
river flowing and there is a sun rising. That's his go to balcony thing. Okay,
1:14:06
virtually you're sitting in the chair but you're virtually there and then you
1:14:09
say what a bright yellow sunny day. So that line has kind of stuck. Okay. So I
1:14:14
ran out of my standup content. Now let's go to the slide. Okay. All right. Here
1:14:21
this is how an entrepreneur is going to look at the balance sheet. And uh there
1:14:27
was a slight changes but it's okay. That's okay. Don't break
1:14:32
the momentum. Uh you see everybody I'm going to can I can I clean the board a
1:14:36
bit? People please drop your pens. Drop your pens for now. It is reading time.
1:14:54
That's okay. I just have to press two. Okay.
1:14:58
How much is the size of the business everybody? What did you say?
1:15:02
What did you say? Size of the business. 26200.
1:15:06
Basically size of the business is nothing but the all the resources
1:15:08
involved. That's the weight of the bag. Correct. Now I'm going to make some
1:15:12
transformation in this whole thing. Joanna, nothing is coming.
1:15:22
Oh, now it comes. The same balance sheet of the same
1:15:27
business at the same point in time has been redrawn with little modification.
1:15:33
figure out what's the difference between the two. What is the change that I have
1:15:36
done? Cash, inventory, receivable. What's the
1:15:42
commonality in all three? Operational. Brilliant. Okay. Current
1:15:49
asset is not wrong answer but current asset is a name given by accountant. We
1:15:52
are not accountant in this class. We are business people. We understand things
1:15:56
better as operational and investments. So these are all operational assets,
1:16:00
short-term assets. What is the difference between all of these three
1:16:03
versus machinery? Machinery is chunky. You have to spend a lot on it, but you
1:16:08
don't buy it very often. On the other hand, inventory is not chunky at all.
1:16:14
It's smaller, funible, but you have to rotate this money again and again. You
1:16:18
buy, you sell, you buy again, you sell again. In machinery, you don't do like
1:16:22
this. Machinery you just buy, use for 5 years, and then maybe when it you see
1:16:26
the nature is different between the two. Look at the marker versus a mic. What is
1:16:30
the difference between the nature? You buy, consume, throw. Buy, consume,
1:16:34
throw. You don't do that with my cash that often. That is how operational
1:16:39
capital and fixed capital differ people. Now we are talking about an
1:16:43
entrepreneurial fund point of view which is a course that we will do again in
1:16:48
term four or term five. Maybe you'll be in France or Mexico or wherever. But on
1:16:53
that day for that to happen, management accounting needs to be understood. Well,
1:16:58
welcome to term three. For that to happen, business planning needs to be
1:17:01
understood well. Welcome to term two. And for that to happen, business
1:17:05
accounting has to be done well, which is term one. That's how the buildup happens
1:17:08
for an entrepreneur. But let us see who's going to differ between these two.
1:17:14
What is the difference between 120 and 10,000?
1:17:18
Difference between 120 and 10,000. One is operational, the other one is
1:17:22
financing. What is the difference? Why do I when do I call something
1:17:26
operational versus when do I call something financing?
1:17:30
Longterm? No, no, no. Long-term, short-term. A
1:17:33
loan can be short-term as well. I have actually in my life taken loan for 21
1:17:38
days from a bank. That was also a financing obligation. It's never
1:17:42
long-term short-term. Uh no, no. What is the difference
1:17:47
between these two? Let me give you an example. Okay. I have been uh hitting
1:17:52
the floor for 2 weeks now. That means I deserve to be paid some amount. And then
1:17:57
the policy of tetar is that the payment will be released once the course is
1:17:59
over. My point is till now tar have consumed my service
1:18:04
and therefore I must be a liability for them outstanding expense. Am I an
1:18:09
operational liability or am I a financing liability?
1:18:14
You see operational liability will never give money. They will always give their
1:18:19
goods and services for which the payment is due. Financing liabilities will
1:18:23
always give you hard cash to the business to do something. What did bank
1:18:28
give you when you had gone there? Money. What did equity bring in the game?
1:18:33
Money. That's financing. And that's why we say it is interestbearing. Anybody
1:18:38
who gives money will charge interest for it. That's why bank charges interest.
1:18:42
But these 120 guys will not charge interest. But anyway, operational guys
1:18:46
are goods and services being supplied. Payment is due. So uh Enzo can you show
1:18:51
the product that you have the box maybe? So there was a very nice product
1:18:58
supplier is let's say ABC form okay so Enzo's team went out and bought this
1:19:02
product this is an inventory in their books right now okay and the payment is
1:19:06
due that supplier gave money to Enzo or that supplier has given some goods and
1:19:11
service to Enzo therefore that supplier is an operational obligation or a
1:19:15
financing obligation that's the difference will the supplier charge
1:19:19
interest or will not charge the interest not interest is charged only when
1:19:23
somebody gives you the money Okay. And now is the fun part. Really the last
1:19:30
bit. Last bit here. This is how investors which is you have
1:19:37
to look at the balance sheet. This is how your accountant will make it. This
1:19:42
is how annual reports will have it. But this is how you have to look at it. What
1:19:46
is the change that I have done? Anybody? People click pictures later. I'll tell
1:19:50
you when to click pictures. Hang on. Start reading. What is the change that I
1:19:54
have made here? Minus operational assets from
1:19:57
operational operational liabilities have been taken
1:20:00
on the other side and have been subtracted from the operational assets
1:20:04
which is 17,080. Rest everything remains as is. Are you with me on that people?
1:20:10
Now this do you see the two sides will still be equal to each other. Okay. It's
1:20:14
not a great shape baba. You have taken some amount on the other hand like in
1:20:18
mathematics you do you change the sign. Whenever you change the sides of the
1:20:21
equation, the two sides will still be equal to each other. My point is, can
1:20:25
you spot a blue box in this? What is the blue box of sixstep framework?
1:20:32
Very good. This is your blue box. The amount of funding that you have raised.
1:20:36
You have raised funding from two places, equity and debt. Where do you spot a
1:20:40
yellow box? The amount of investments that you have done in assets. There are
1:20:44
two type of investments you have done. long-term investments which get fixed
1:20:49
and short-term rotational operational investments which continue to get
1:20:53
rotated. What is the enterprise value? It is a
1:20:58
value of equity and debt put together. 26080
1:21:04
which is the value of debt and equity. Simple.
1:21:07
What is the form value? That's also the meaning the same. And both of them as
1:21:12
you can see differ from the size of the business. Size of business was 26200.
1:21:18
This is 26 080. Marginal difference. What is the reason for the difference
1:21:23
between the two? This is operational obligations.
1:21:27
Absorb this. The sometimes we learn something which is not helpful at the
1:21:33
very moment but it is going to be helpful at one point in time. Okay.
1:21:37
After the break when we meet we will reaffirm this concepts when we take the
1:21:41
case to the next phase. Um not pictures still not now. One more minute. If there
1:21:48
is a question that is being asked to the promoter, how much is the total capital
1:21:53
employed in the business? What number will you give? There are so many
1:21:58
numbers. What number will you give? Question is important. How much is total
1:22:02
capital employed in the business? What number will you give?
1:22:07
26 080.
1:22:11
The capital comes from only two sources. That means capital employed is nothing
1:22:14
but your blue box equity and debt. How much of the capital is blocked in
1:22:20
long-term asset? What number will you give?
1:22:24
Blocked in your long-term assets? 9,000. And have you heard about the name called
1:22:29
as working capital? Okay. My business was very good but my working capital
1:22:35
consumed all my money. I could not manage my working capital. Working
1:22:38
capital is so important. you know Pratam and the entire team will also in the
1:22:42
drop shipping will help you manage the the working capital is this box
1:22:48
the amount that you invest in your operational assets so when Enzo's team
1:22:52
has gone out and bought that box their money is stuck now but that money is
1:22:58
stuck not in a place like machinery which is stuck for 3 years it is stuck
1:23:02
temporarily till the time they sell their inventory and it will get will be
1:23:06
released but what will Enzo do with the money that will get released is he'll
1:23:09
not take it home. He will buy more inventory.
1:23:13
That's how the rotational capital is also another name that we use for
1:23:18
working capital. We call it revolving capital. We call it rotational capital.
1:23:23
Better name is working capital. So these are two different capitals that
1:23:29
are invested in the business. We could never speak about them before this
1:23:32
because for that equity focus has to come in which happened today. So I
1:23:37
understand it's a heavy class and that's why I needed two classes together and
1:23:42
it's going to happen after the break. So sometimes you know you feel worse
1:23:45
finally before feeling better. It is this kind of a feeling right now I can
1:23:49
sense. I'm sure when we leave the room after the second class you will be
1:23:53
feeling much better. Okay. This is a time to click the picture
1:24:01
total capital employed. Yeah,
1:24:06
that's also to capital employed because this everybody tells you from
1:24:13
where it is coming and this is telling you where it is
1:24:19
going. Yeah.
1:24:28
We have office hours 6 to 7. Yeah. We can do that again. Yeah, sure.
1:24:35
But once you look at the second class today, maybe the need to do that will go
1:24:39
down because that's a repeat of the whole thing. We have one more class
1:24:46
because this is half finished. All right, everybody. We are good to
1:24:50
break. Yeah. Thank you very much.

How can we use financial numbers to compare firms and perform time series analysis on different dimensions of the business health, such as enough liquidty
26/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:45
all right everybody between the you and your freedom it is
0:49
me who is standing and I appreciate that fact okay um self-awareness is the
0:54
biggest asset and thankfully sometimes I do have it um so who wants to get free
0:59
like by Three. Who wants to get free by three?
1:09
Free means like good to go home. Anon, you don't want to go.
1:16
My god, look at the energy. So, and what are you saying?
1:22
Are you saying that I'm lying? Are you saying I'm lying again?
1:27
Yet another time? Just because you didn't give me
1:30
something free samples. Okay. By the way, I made you famous in
1:35
the other class. I took your example while we were talking about the equity
1:38
and stuff. That's what
1:42
No, no. No. No. You may go home. You will or not. That only time can tell.
1:49
You may. You may. Depends on how good or bad you are. Okay. Everybody. Um, so I
1:54
see some fresh faces who were not there in the morning class. Raise hands
1:57
everybody. Those who are not there, make sure you're sitting with somebody who
2:01
was there. Sit with somebody who was there. So, uh,
2:05
so Arin Arin, uh, oh, are you carrying your kitchen along? You bring your
2:10
kitchen stuff as well. What's that? I want to take a look. Is that your drop
2:15
shipping product? What in an accounting
2:25
what in an accounting class can this be used for?
2:30
It's like a samurai or something. Thank you. Keep it please. Just take
2:34
care. Just just aren sit with somebody. Maybe
2:38
you can sit with her. She was very good. Yeah.
2:48
H uh other people who were not there in the morning session raise hands please
2:53
everybody there you were there so you are sitting with him okay just make sure
2:57
that you take a download uh because it's a continuation of the case that's the
3:00
only point otherwise you know obviously every session is quite independent um um
3:06
all right all right uh so the target is that we may get free by three okay but
3:12
there is no pressure to get it all right number one. Number two, um let's say
3:17
yesterday's session was pretty light. Cash inflows coming in, cash inflow
3:20
outflows going out. I felt that it was like below your pay grade. So, uh in in
3:25
the hindsight, I thought that I might not have insulted anybody by asking two
3:28
easy questions. Um in case you are one of those who want to
3:34
do serious business, sometimes you see as entrepreneurs, you're like, "Oh, I'm
3:38
just here for a joy ride and then we I will just test my waters and then there
3:41
is a family business I have to join." In any case, that's not really the right
3:44
audience. But in case you are serious about starting something own and
3:48
understanding and doing an aware job out of that, then today's session is going
3:52
to make sense. But disclaimer, this is not the end of
3:57
discussion that we are going to begin today. We will continue with this
4:00
discussion in the second term business planning and forecasting course. We will
4:05
continue with this discussion in third term management accounting and more
4:08
particularly in corporate and entrepreneurial finance in term four
4:12
where you'll be somewhere in Mexico or Ghana or France or wherever which means
4:17
that this whole process is a thought that you have to try and catch even if
4:23
you are unable to figure out let's say even 50% of it don't judge yourself what
4:29
we're doing today is anyway little not difficult but yeah It's a little
4:35
hard-hitting and then you're like, "Oh my god, can we look at all of these
4:39
things just by these numbers?" That's the point. So, like I I've been saying
4:42
from the first day that financial statements are answers to what kind of
4:46
question the questions are going to become more tricky, more complicated,
4:51
more difficult. Answers will remain pretty simple. What we calculate on the
4:55
board, what you do on your scribble are the answers. Nobody have asked you
4:58
questions as yet. Now we are preparing for this is the last class where and
5:02
after that we meet in the analysis phase. In analysis every stakeholder
5:06
will be asking us questions only. Nobody will worry about whether you have got
5:10
the right profit or right the bank balance but how much is the this how
5:13
much is that? There are questions that you'll have to answer. So try and get to
5:16
that mentality. 50% understanding is also a good understanding. All right.
5:21
Don't judge yourself too harsh but looking at your performance before lunch
5:25
I think you're able you should be able to get like about 70 75% of it
5:31
towards the last 30% where the legal forms are going to come up just
5:36
channelize some kind of a super energy within yourself and just try and
5:41
continue to connect sometimes some things take time to get
5:45
absorbed that's the disclaimer that I have all
5:49
right are we good to All right, for the benefit of people who
5:52
are not there, we spoke about the balance sheet. Balance sheet is nothing
5:55
but you know the leftover all said and done. That's the tagline. You are left
5:59
over with two things. All your resources on one hand and all your obligations on
6:03
the other. So we were basing ourselves on this particular case. Those who were
6:07
there in the class, how much is the value of resource that you ended the
6:10
year with? 26,200. Fantastic. Is there any
6:15
obligation that a business has to pay to somebody?
6:17
How much? 10,120. How many line items are there within
6:23
10,120? Two. What is the difference between
6:26
these two? One is
6:30
financing. Very good. The other one is operating. Fantastic. Okay. So, this was
6:34
the bank balance. This was a profit balance. Simple exercise. And you had,
6:38
you know, the focusing on all the resources and all the obligations. And
6:42
that's what we said. How much is owner's money in the bag? The owner's money in
6:47
the bag. You can calculate two ways. Number one, total size of the bag. How
6:50
much is total size of the bag? 26,000.
6:52
26,200. The total assets are always referred as the total size of the bag.
6:56
And out of that, how much you have to pay to outsiders? 101 120 whatever
7:00
remains. And that's must be for the owners. There's another version of it.
7:05
How do you calculate owner's value? That is how much has owners contributed
7:08
initially? How much did they contribute initially?
7:11
20,000. And what did business do with that 20,000? Did they grow the money or
7:15
did they lose that money? Destroy the money. Destroy the money. Destroy by
7:20
Destroy by what amount? 3 920. 3 920 is the loss. Loss is nothing but wealth
7:27
destruction, loss making businesses. So that's how the 26 um closing this 20,000
7:34
and -3920 leads you to uh 16,000. In both the ways obviously answer is there.
7:39
So um may I may I may I request you to quickly recall that we did something
7:45
like this. Uh Joanna this is not the latest version I think. Is this the
7:49
version? Let me just check. One sec. Correct. This is the version. Correct.
7:52
Uh people this was a very very heavy slide and this is something deliberately
7:58
been given to you knowing that you will not understand everything but some
8:02
things are like in the third attempt you will understand. So somebody has to
8:04
start the first attempt once. This is the first attempt today. All right.
8:08
Right? So even if you don't understand but we still were able to catch up a few
8:11
things. How much is the total size of the business? We said
8:14
26,200. This is the total assets. Okay. Then we
8:20
clubbed all these operational assets into one. How are these two different in
8:24
nature? What did we say? How are these two different in nature? Very good.
8:28
Brilliant point. The fixed capital is always chunky. Meaning that you have to
8:32
spend a lot and not very frequently like you buying a phone. You don't have to
8:38
buy phone every day but once you buy huge amount of cash goes down. That's
8:42
your 9,000 fixed assets. And what is this other 17,200? This is like you
8:47
putting you know gas in your car. You recharging your phone. Okay. You paying
8:50
your gas bills, you paying your electricity bills of the house, tetra
8:54
paying this rent. This is like the operational day-to-day buying markers.
8:57
something which is very frequent continue to revolve
9:01
and so buying the inventory that's where the revolving rotational operational
9:06
these are the words that some people will use also called as the operational
9:10
assets and then in the third version what I did was I took this operational
9:15
liability and subtracted it from the operational asset making this uh to
9:20
quickly tell me assets minus liability is equity or capital asset minus
9:25
liability is capital. Therefore, operational assets minus operational
9:29
liability is operational capital also called as working capital. So whenever
9:34
you are worried about how much is my working capital is my working capital
9:37
the problem am I able to handle my inventory well when you will be neck
9:41
deep into your drop shipping venture the promoters the mentors pratam kiti all
9:45
these are going to ask question how much is the working capital in the business
9:48
what are they asking they are essentially asking you this 1780
9:53
how do you calculate working capital all operational assets
9:57
subtract operational liabilities from it that's your working capital are you
10:01
together on that everybody on this point can you bring up a calculator.
10:05
Calculator app sorted question that I'm asking is you
10:14
don't have to punch it. How much is the capital invested in the business?
10:19
How much is the capital invested in the business? Pick up from this whole slide.
10:23
Capital invested in the business. The blue box
10:27
capital invested in the business is 26,080.
10:32
the capital that I have taken from debt and from equity. These are the two
10:37
people who invest the money. Okay. So 26,80
10:41
from this side when you look at it these are the people who provide the money. So
10:45
26,80 is coming from their pocket and then the other side is answering where
10:52
has it been spent. Are you with me on that? The total always have to be the
10:56
same. That's what we said. This side is the blue box. This side is the yellow
10:59
box of your sixstep framework. The money that you raise from blue box is spent in
11:03
the yellow box. That's what we did on the first day. That's what you now see
11:06
in the numbers. How much money did you raise from debt?
11:11
10. How much money have you raised till date from equity?
11:15
16,080. Now out of 20 you have destroyed 3920. Now how much money of equity
11:21
remains? Only 16,080. This is the total capital employed, total enterprise
11:26
value, total firm value. These are the names that investors will talk to you
11:30
about. All they are referring to is debt and equity. Okay, this is capital
11:34
employed. But capital employed where I employ capital at two places. Places
11:40
where it gets blocked. Welcome to fixed assets. Places where it continues to
11:45
rotate. This is your working capital. Sorted. Now calculator can you do 17,080
11:52
1 17080 1 17080
11:57
divided by 26080. Let me give you the numbers that I'm
12:03
talking about. The total is 26080 and I'm dividing it by 17080. How much
12:10
is the percentage you're getting? What is this 65%? I want you to
12:15
interpret it. What is this 65%.
12:20
No. What is the numerator? Tell me what is
12:23
the numerator? No. What is the numerator? Very good. Brilliant. Working
12:28
capital. And what is the denominator? What is the denominator? This is what an
12:33
entrepreneur needs to do. Numbers are not the important. What is the
12:36
description? What is the meaning behind it? What is 2680 signifying?
12:42
The total. Total what? No total asset is 26,200.
12:47
What is 26,80 signifying? Very good. Total capital employed.
12:54
So this 65% is answering an important dimension of the health of the business.
12:58
Out of the total capital that you are employing, how much of it is in working
13:02
capital? How much of it is rotating? That means 65% of your capital is
13:07
continuing to rotate in the business. Good news. only only 35% gets blocked.
13:14
It's wonderful good news. So therefore these kind of businesses are very good
13:18
investable businesses which don't block the money. 65% is rotating. How do I
13:23
arrive at such an important parameter? Taking the rotational capital dividing
13:27
it by the total capital. This is what investor community talk about and judge
13:31
the businesses in. Are we together? So this is like the foundational class to
13:35
talk about more things such as this. Okay. All right.
13:40
Everybody welcome to year two. This is the first time you're looking at a case
13:45
where sequentially the company continues the business. And
13:51
may I quickly ask you to recall uh what were you left with? What kind of
13:57
resources were you left with? No, that was total. But what kind of
14:01
resources? Inventory,
14:03
machinery, bank balance and
14:07
receivables. These are the four things that you're left over with. And on the
14:10
obligation side, what were you left with?
14:12
These are the distribution charges. Distribution charges outstanding and
14:15
some of the loans. These are the leftovers which you used to carry
14:20
forward in the next year. So when you will start doing the business in the
14:24
next year, that becomes the opening balance. Can I use the word? Meaning
14:28
this time you are not starting your bank account with a zero number. You're
14:32
starting with a 9900 already. Meaning in the second year when you open your go
14:36
down you see 2,500 worth of inventory already. It's not an empty go down.
14:41
Meaning when you speak to customers you already know oh 4,800 is what you see
14:45
there are some history to it. This is the first time you're looking at a
14:49
sequential case. So I give you the transactions that the business have done
14:55
in the second year and I want you to calculate same basic stuff. How much is
15:01
the bank balance at the end of second year? And how much is a profit for
15:04
second year? Six transactions only. Yes sir. You okay? Have you done it?
15:10
Okay. So, so don't give me the answer as yet. Everybody take 10 minutes, 15
15:14
minutes, whatever time it takes. Get me? These are the opening balances that you
15:19
have at the beginning of the second year.
15:26
You have 10 minutes, 15 minutes, whatever it takes. So what are what are
15:30
you answering? How much is the bank balance and how much is the profit
15:33
balance? Second year is what you are focusing on.
15:38
These are the only transactions. Very few transactions are done.
15:43
Please get the right profit number and get the right
15:49
bank account. But here we wait.
15:54
Let me see the numbers first. I want to ask a question.
15:57
Mhm. For for profits, we're only calculating the year two.
16:00
Yeah. Yeah. That's what these are. Mhm. Mhm.
16:04
Both of them. Mm.
16:23
500. Okay. Very
16:35
good. Selling some goods at a value higher
16:40
than that. Only two numbers that we want. And
16:54
everybody it's always a good idea to work on the bank balance first that's
16:57
easier. So let us first of all get the
17:17
Those who get the number just raise the hand.
17:33
I will come and see. Don't announce the number.
17:45
cash. That's it. I like that attitude. It is
17:50
just cash. Focus on just cash. That's what you need to calculate the bank
17:56
balance. Nothing is more important when you're
17:59
talking about cash flows. It's only the cash which is what you got to focus on.
18:18
So are you focusing on cash or you focusing on profit?
18:29
So again you're answering something. What is the question? Is the question
18:33
about the cash? Then you're focusing only on cash.
18:35
Where inventory would go? Would that be in profit or would that be in I think
18:40
it's people two different questions these are
18:47
how much is your profit balance separate issue how much is your cash balance
18:51
separate issue catch the cash first
18:57
cash numbers cash number don't announce
19:02
buttonm no
19:08
Okay. Read the case hard. Read the case hard.
19:12
You've got the number. Oh, you are there. Of course. Of course.
19:15
Of course. Uh, no. Can you increase the font? I think I
19:21
think I didn't see. No, no, no. Cash. Cash value.
19:27
Bam. Cash. No. No. No. You by far. Come on.
19:35
You're way off. I think you're missing on some point.
19:39
Some major error has happened. You're very close. You're very, very close.
19:45
Think about it. Think about it. Everybody, accounting is never
19:49
difficult. I think basis the three wrong answers, you are not reading the
19:53
transaction carefully enough. Read it. You have the time. We can go home like
19:58
right now. I mean, oh, it's already 3:00. Oh my god, dude. We're not going
20:01
at 3 for sure. Maybe some time. What's one sec? Cash balance. Cash balance.
20:09
No, this is more of a technical question. If
20:13
I already have my things, how can I mention that?
20:19
I am not the champ. You maybe have to close
20:23
the bracket. Are you closing the bracket?
20:29
Maybe consult. No, I can do this in calculator.
20:34
Okay. From receivables then 200,000
20:40
in cash 2,000.
20:42
2,000 less. And 2,000 less what? Do you have to pay
20:46
2,000 to somebody or do you already have paid for the inventory?
20:50
Because you were saying that actually selling is also a cost, right? If it's
20:55
inventory. Yeah. So right now you're not worried
20:56
about costs and income. Right? Now you're worried about the bank balance.
21:00
Focus only on your wallet. Cash going out, cash coming in. So you your
21:04
inventory is already paid for. You don't have to pay for that again.
21:10
Okay. You are very close. This is exactly
21:13
where Aisha was. This is correct. This is the onera.
21:19
How much? 30. You're missing one transaction. How
21:25
much are you getting? That's it. the bank loan is it like come does it
21:33
come into 3,000 does it come into bank because normally it's not your money
21:40
that it's like minus so when you repay the bank loan will the
21:46
money that you have goes down or does it remain same
21:50
that's it so it's an outflow minus -
21:56
50 as well as 3,000 In both the cases, the money will go out a lot.
22:01
Wait, wait. You're on profit. Your bank is right.
22:05
Correct. Brilliant. How much are you getting? 3830.
22:10
3830. You calculate the bank balance, right?
22:13
Yeah. Cash collection from customers. Three.
22:19
How much? How much? How much? Very good.
22:29
Very good. Very good.
22:37
Point number six. Oh, is it me everybody? Point number
22:42
six. Rent and other operational expenses incurred 10,200.
22:49
So many rental expenses and operational expenses like salary this that were
22:53
incurred and they were paid also along with the outstanding from the previous
23:00
years. Is there anything that is outstanding from the previous year?
23:04
How much? 120. That means how much you would have
23:08
paid this year? 10 200 for the second one and also 120 from the previous one.
23:14
So about 120 you consumed it last year but you paid it next year. That's a
23:19
clear-cut demarcation between liquidity and profitability.
23:23
Wait, you have got the bank balance right. I'll come you have no I'll come
23:27
to profit. I'll give you time for profit.
23:31
You are only looking at bank and I like what menu and you said just focus dude
23:37
on cash. Only on cash please.
23:41
How much is just for
23:44
38. Can you like
23:55
2500 number one?
24:05
Okay. Okay. That means 4,800 will more come as an
24:08
invoice. Oh, so that's okay. So we add 4,000
24:11
4,800. Yeah. And then in terms of the outcome, you have a bank paid very good.
24:15
You have interest paid very good. You have rent paid very good.
24:24
So it's 10,000. Just add one more line item. Outstanding
24:27
expenses 120. Where's the 120?
24:30
Where the last year's last year's outstanding?
24:34
Uh it is right here. Okay. Read the transaction carefully
24:41
everybody. The bank balance is The bank balance is
24:48
383 0.
24:52
The correct bank balance is 383 0. How many people could get 3830? Good.
24:59
All right. And most of us are there one or transactions here and there. Those
25:04
who have got the bank balance, please move to the profit balance. How much is
25:08
the profitability? Incomes and expenses. Where did you get it? Right.
25:14
How much did you get it? 293. Okay. And it is 33 because what's
25:21
the gap? 900. 900 is what you're missing out right
25:26
now. So you have 9,000. No. Opening is 9,900.
25:33
There you go. Profit.
25:39
Profit. Tell me the profit number. Very good.
25:42
Correct. Bank balance. Right. Profit.
25:47
Okay. How much? How much is the bank balance?
25:52
Did you get 330? All right. Um, work on the profit.
25:57
Uh, sorry, the screen went out. Working on the profit.
25:59
Working on the profit. Okay. Can you teach me how to get the profit?
26:02
Profit only. Look at the incomes and look at the expenses.
26:07
So incomes are when you're selling the goods to the customers. So in this
26:12
there's only one transaction of selling. So this 2500 becomes your sales and look
26:18
at all the expenses that you are incurred. For example, the rent
26:21
expenses, expense, the uh consumption of goods or just go transaction by
26:28
transaction and figure out where my consumptions where my expenses are. Add
26:32
all expenses subtracted from income you get your
26:36
I have one. So what value from here do I use for the
26:42
initial for what
26:44
for this year's profits do I look at these
26:47
nothing nothing profit is that particular year's incomes and expenses
26:51
have nothing to do with what happened last year that's a very good question
26:55
but like this is from the last year and
26:58
these are the 4800 2500
27:04
1320 3050 that's it it's that simple Oh
27:10
yeah, I'm guessing these are the list of
27:14
obligations and resources more or less. It is right.
27:18
So in the initial contribution, do we use the resources we had left last time?
27:24
Think about it. Anybody with the profit number,
27:30
is it gain or a loss? Very
27:38
good. You will not include it. Every year's
27:44
loss is different. Last year you burned 3920. That's separate. This year you're
27:48
going to burn more. No,
27:54
you got it now. It is 1,000's gap.
28:01
How much how much profit are we getting on this corner of the room?
28:06
How much profit or loss? Okay. All right.
28:10
Okay. Take it easy. We have a lot of time.
28:14
Loss or profit? One more time. One more time. Sorry, I
28:25
missed the question. things like those legal chances are you
28:29
also the second year without just see in case it is mentioned
28:33
separately otherwise don't assume don't assume
28:37
anybody don't assume any expense of the first year to be repeating unless
28:43
something specifically has been mentioned here yes ma'am expenses cost
28:48
the same as no so in the second year the business is
28:53
different in the second year you will incur different kind of expenses
28:56
So the first expense is going to be the consumption of inventory 2,000. Second
29:01
expense is going to be the machine depreciation.
29:04
No legal charge, no marketing, nothing. Third expense is going to be interest.
29:09
Fourth is going to be rent and operational expenses.
29:12
So machinery. So machinery you already have an old
29:16
machinery worth 9,000. You will use it more. And it says machinery usage
29:21
pattern is the same. Which means last year you used the machinery for 1,000.
29:28
This time you're using it only for 6 months which mean which is half of it
29:32
500. And then the remaining machinery gets lost by floods. So that again
29:37
becomes a loss for you. So just go line item it counts as a loss. Very good.
29:45
Give me the loss number. You're close. You're doing a very good
29:49
job. You're very close. Have you got the number? One. No. No. Is this a balance
29:56
or is this a loss? H. So rent is 10,200.
30:10
Just subtract that also from this. Yeah. Uh where is
30:19
H? So the rental expense are going to be uh administrative expenses.
30:25
Yeah, everybody the answer to the loss for the second year
30:32
loss is I don't know you figure out
30:38
the the the now first of all everybody figure out
30:44
this fact that the profits whatever you're going to get gains or a loss has
30:50
nothing to do with the already loss of 3920. That loss of 3920 is your
30:58
performance in the first year. That has nothing to do with the performance that
31:01
you're calculating. Now let's say this is another loss. Actual number of loss
31:07
is 18,750. 18,750 is the loss that the business is
31:14
incurring in the second year. Let's go item by item. You have made only one
31:19
sales 2500. And what is the cost of goods that were sold?
31:25
2,000. So that becomes an expense. Then how much did you consume the machinery
31:30
for? 6 months only. So which means 1,000 was the usage cost
31:35
last year. 500 is going to be this year. What has the value of machinery become
31:41
from a 9,000 at the beginning of the year? You use it by 500. So the
31:45
machinery value becomes 8,500. It is this moment the floods enter the
31:50
factory and your machine is lost. What would you tell the world? How much is
31:53
your loss of machinery? Not 9,000 only 8,500 because 500 did not lose. You used
32:00
it. Are you with me on that? How is 500 different than 8,500 in nature?
32:06
Okay. And then there was some bank interest also. And then there was some
32:10
rent and operational expense of 10,200. Don't forget expense is operational.
32:17
Expense is consumption. Expense is not payment.
32:21
So here is your loss of 18,750 comes in. What I wanted to highlight is this is in
32:31
addition to 3 920
32:38
that was incurred in year 1. This 18,750 does not include that 3,900.
32:47
This is extra loss that you have incurred. So it's like saying the
32:51
student failed in term one and the student again has failed in term two
32:56
with even worse grades. That is the situation of this business.
33:02
So the loss of second year does not have anything to do with the loss of the
33:07
first year. It is over and above that. Are you with me on that people? You have
33:14
a minute or so to quickly bring yourself up to this point.
33:21
Most of you were right except at one or two places. So don't go home thinking,
33:26
"Oh my god, I did not get anything." For example, Myra had done everything right.
33:30
It was just the opening cash balance of this 9,900. She had written 9,000. So
33:36
her answer was differing by just 900. It means that everything is right about
33:41
her. Just that one clerical error. Absolutely. A colleague is the best
33:48
asset that you can have. Always nudge your partner to say, "Hey, how did you
33:51
get that? Can you tell me that?" That's how entrepreneurs also do.
34:00
These are consumptions. Don't forget these are not the payments.
34:07
And these are your payments. You see two different questions. How is
34:21
the business performing? Profit or loss is the answer. How much liquidity the
34:25
business have? Bank balance is the answer.
34:32
Quick answer that I need. Has the liquidity improved during the year or
34:36
has the liquidity worsened during the year?
34:40
By how much? Very good. Fantastic. The net change in
34:46
cash 6,70 is the net fall in the bank balance. This is the fall in liquidity.
34:53
You started the year with 9900. You're ending it at 3,800. So this is the fall
34:58
in liquidity. And that's what fall in liquidity
35:07
670. Are you with me on that?
35:12
If an investor ask uh how much is the cash balance that you have, what number
35:16
will you give? Absolutely. Depends on what point in
35:20
time the investor is asking. If investor is asking at the end of the second year,
35:24
how much cash balance do I have now? 3830. How much was the balance at the
35:29
beginning of the second year? 9,900. This will continue to keep changing.
35:34
Yes, ma'am. I don't know if it's too much to ask.
35:36
Can we go back to the previous? Yeah. Yeah, sure.
35:40
Everybody, but uh because of you know this everybody's working at a different
35:44
pace. Slides have already been given to you as in-class material in session 8.
35:49
So in case somebody is let's say falling behind a step or wants to move forward,
35:52
they can always download the slide from there and they can work peacefully. No
35:55
problem in that. Does it say cost of goods sold?
35:58
Very good. Good point. Very good point. My Where does it say cost of goods sold?
36:02
Anybody? Where does it say cost of goods sold,
36:06
sir? Second line, where does it say cost of
36:09
goods sold? Selling the inventory worth 2,000.
36:13
That's what cost of goods sold is. What is the cost of inventory? That
36:17
fantastic. So, the selling price of inventory is 2500. The cost of the
36:21
inventory is 2,000. Sure. Enzo, I need your product. The
36:27
massager. I'm so glad that you have got it.
36:32
And you should be glad that Okay, everybody. Enzo's team. Does your
36:40
venture have a name? Elan.
36:47
Elen Thurm. Elen. Okay. Elen for now. Elen for now.
36:53
The venture the business called as Elen have purchased this for 50 50 dirhams
36:58
and they're selling it for 54. Which out of these two numbers is cost
37:03
of goods sold? No, let answer 50 because that is the
37:08
cost to the business themselves. That's the point. And 54 is the selling
37:14
price which they are charging the customer.
37:16
Oh, okay. I'm going to keep it. Okay, I will use
37:19
it in the class. In the class. Don't worry. Don't worry. This is yours. Okay.
37:24
Ilenum is having, you know, like skipping a heartbeat. No free samples.
37:29
Don't worry everybody. Any question that you have, time to ask is now.
37:35
Anything that you're missing, it's okay, absolutely okay to not know. But it is
37:40
not okay to not know and not ask. Are we ready? Good. Now, with the second
37:47
year done, how was the second year's performance? What would your answer be?
37:51
Only bad. Will you say only bad? Horrible. Much worse than the last year.
37:58
Last year, how much did you destroy? 3,920 shareholders money. How much did
38:04
you destroy this year? My god. 18,750. You destroyed somebody's wealth. You,
38:09
meaning the business. Okay. All right. Now, with the second year done and
38:15
dusted. I mean, the year is not dusted. You got dusted. What is the leftover?
38:21
Leftover is always the favorite list for Jackmma. Left over.
38:27
Jackma, what are the resources that you are left
38:32
with? Don't give me the values, but what are the resources that you're left with?
38:36
Cash balance. Very good. And inventory.
38:39
Inventory. And machine. What happened with machine? Gone. What
38:44
happened to receivables? Received.
38:46
They were received. So the promises have been you know complied by with the the
38:51
person is not going to give it to you again. Okay. And oh oh my god one thing
38:55
I did not ask that happens when you have a good student um collection of cash
39:00
from receivables. Is this not going to show up in the income in the second
39:03
year? No.
39:04
Why not? Because it's already been promised.
39:07
You've written it down in the previous year.
39:09
Correct. Written it down. You have already written it in the income
39:13
statement in the first year. You will not double count the income. Is it fair
39:17
to say focus only on one? Focus only on one cahoot question. If a business
39:22
incurs a credit sale in which the collection happens next year, this is a
39:27
situation. Is it fair to say that year 1 shows higher profitability but year two
39:34
will show higher liquidity? Is it fair to say that the profits got booked in
39:39
the first year because the sales and the delivery got done then but the
39:42
collection in cash is happening in the second year because the customer is
39:46
paying now. Are you with me on that? This is how sometimes you see the year-
39:50
wise profitability and liquidity differ from each other. You say, "Oh my god,
39:54
last year was so profitable. Where is the bank balance?" Oh, I realized I sold
39:57
to sold on credit and in the second year the sales are not good but suddenly cash
40:02
is flowing up. Why? Oh, the last year's collections are coming now this year. So
40:06
this is the understanding that you got to maintain.
40:09
Okay everybody, now I am at an exciting juncture and this is where I meant just
40:13
keep some stamina on. All right, it's it's on the downhill. It's about to get
40:18
finished. How much are the leftovers? Now this is a photo that I'm clicking at
40:22
the end of year two. What are the leftovers? You
40:26
said the bank balance and and inventory. How much is the worth of
40:32
each of these? You calculate the bank balance. How much was it?
40:35
38 3 0. Fair point. And how much was
40:40
inventory? 500.
40:42
What happened to your inventory? It was 2500.
40:44
2,000. Sold 2,000. Fantastic. Was any free
40:47
samples given? No.
40:48
No free samples given. And was any goods stolen? Thank God. So you were like
40:52
tight at least on those two fronts. So that means your total resources left,
40:58
may I use the word left for third year because second year has already ended.
41:03
The second day's war gets over. How many soldiers are you left with? You are left
41:06
with four. How much is the total? 33.
41:10
4 33 0. What is 4330? It is the all said and done the leftover assets which you
41:18
can use when in the third year. Are you with me on that? Okay. Is there any
41:24
obligation that is left or you have complied by everything? You have paid
41:29
some bank loan also. No. How much is the obligation left?
41:34
7,000 bank loan 7,000. What about the rent and
41:41
operational expenses? All paid.
41:42
All paid. What about the previous year's operational expenses? All paid. What
41:47
about the suppliers? No purchase. No purchase was done in the
41:52
second year, remember? Okay. So, how much is the obligation therefore?
41:57
7,000. What is the value of equity? Can I borrow this bag?
42:01
Yeah, go for it. What is the size of the bag at the end
42:05
of second year? 4,330.
42:10
Very good. This bag has made promises to pay something to outsiders. What are
42:15
those promises worth? 7,000. So, how much is owner's money in
42:20
the bag? Minus I'm going to keep it - 2,660.
42:28
What was equity? By the way, owner's money is total money in the bag minus
42:33
outsiders. How much is total money in the bag? Only 4330.
42:39
And how much are obligations? Oh my god. Which means equities money is
42:45
negative 2670. What does a negative equity signify?
42:52
That this money equity must bring into the bag immediately. There is no money
42:59
that equity has left in the bag. Negative balance means the bag is
43:03
calling for more money from the equity. Now where will this money come from?
43:08
Equity has to sell personal houses, personal assets, personal jewelry,
43:12
personal watches, personal rings, personal watch, everything personal.
43:16
Doesn't matter where you get it from. You got to pump in the money into the
43:19
business. By the way, why? Because
43:23
why do you why does a business need more money? Pick up the numbers. Why does the
43:28
business need more money? Very good. To pay the obligations. How
43:32
much obligations are standing on your head?
43:34
And how much is the resource that you are left with? Therefore, there's a
43:38
shortage. No. Who's going to be? So, think about it. There is a party at your
43:42
house and the food falls short. Do you expect another guest to organize the
43:46
food or the host has to organize the food? That's the point. Equity is the
43:50
host. So, equity the host organized the party called as a business. The money
43:55
fell short 4330 and the consumption or the obligation
44:00
that you have to honor the guests are more 7,000. What do you do? Order more
44:03
food. Now where will the guest get the money from? That's not guest problem. It
44:08
is hostess problem. Are you with me on that? Any confusion whatsoever that you
44:13
have? Yes. 7,000. Good point. So how much was a
44:20
bank loan that was outstanding at the beginning of the second year? 10,000 and
44:26
then you repaid how much? 3,000. So, how much is yet to be paid
44:31
for the 7. Okay, everybody pick up a calculator.
44:37
Question of the machine. Loss of machine.
44:41
The machine was 9,000 at the beginning of the second year.
44:44
Yes. Yep.
44:45
And then we used it for 6 months.
44:48
That means the machine became older by 500.
44:51
Yeah. So, I feel like we don't know the count of that. If the machine was lost
44:55
and we used it already, then No, the machine was lost after 6 months
44:59
of usage. Yes. So, it's just 8,500
45:04
is the loss. So, so easy easy. You had machinery
45:10
worth 10,000. This is year 1
45:16
and this is year two. Are you able to read this? you lose or
45:22
you consume a th00and the value of the machinery becomes a 9,000. This is
45:28
reflecting value of machine where does the value of
45:33
machine go here. In the second year you consume it by 500 only for 6 months
45:40
which means the value of the machinery by now has become equal to 8500.
45:46
Is it not fair to say that 500 has been used, 500 has been consumed, 500 is the
45:51
expense, not the loss? People, loss is when you lose something without any
45:56
value coming back. Here 500 worth of machinery was actually used to make
46:00
inventory and stuff like that. That means it's not a loss. It's an actual
46:03
expense. But now is where you lost this machine. This is a 1 and a half year old
46:09
machine, not a one-year-old machine. This is the loss. This is my expense.
46:17
Both expense and losses hit your income statement. Here is the loss. Here is the
46:23
expense. But both needs to be shown separately. That's the whole idea.
46:27
Expense are good. Losses are bad. Expense is planned. Losses are sudden.
46:33
Expense are systematic. Losses are abrupt. So when you lose your phone,
46:38
that's a bad idea. But when you use your phone to do something, that's a good
46:42
idea. So whenever next time um you know you have a feeling that oh my god I'm
46:46
incurring so much expenses think that business is incurring expense that means
46:50
some value is coming back to you it's not a bad idea at least you're not
46:53
burning the money okay so far so good everybody we are are you having a
46:59
calculator in hand h we want to ask you how much is equity's money in the
47:05
business at the end of the second year you gave me an answer of 2670 from one
47:09
method I want to think from a different point point of view. Equity, how much
47:15
was your value in the business at the beginning of the second year?
47:21
How much was equity's value at the beginning of the second year?
47:26
How much was the value of equity? Very good. 20,000 at the beginning of
47:33
the first year, you lose how much in the first year? 3920.
47:38
How much was equity's value at the end of the first year?
47:42
16,080 that's what we reconciled in the morning session. Now with this 16,080
47:48
equity guys started to do the business in the second year and in the second
47:52
year what happened? The business lost how much?
47:58
18750. Where is the loss of the business? Oh my god.
48:04
Now people I'm going to make a statement. You tell me you understand
48:07
this or not. The money was lost by business.
48:12
Second, money of equity was lost. Business does not have its own money.
48:20
Business is doing business is doing activities using somebody else's money.
48:23
Either equity or debt. Business is a empty piggy bank. Remember step one, you
48:29
raise money from equity. Business is different. Shareholder is different.
48:34
When Tesla Motors incurs a loss, Elon Musk becomes poor. Tesla Motor does not
48:39
become poor. Tesla Motor does not have anything. It is the shareholder who
48:44
grows. It is a shareholder who becomes poorer. But the game is played by the
48:48
business. Is this nomenclature clear? So business is like an agent that you
48:53
appoint to grow the wealth for you. The agent can do a good job also. The agent
48:57
can do a bad job also. Are you with me on that? All right. So
49:02
how much is that was the opening equity that's the wealth destruction how much
49:05
is the equity's value at the end of the second year 2 670.
49:11
So you have to come to terms to the fact that this is how the startup ecosystem
49:17
functions year after year those buggers are making losses and they are the worst
49:21
thing is they are so proud of it. They are so proud of the fact that we are
49:26
burning shareholders money. They have started to wear it as a badge of honor.
49:30
Who is a more successful startup or a more daring startup? The one who burns
49:34
more money. While like a catapult, have you seen a
49:38
catapult? You kind of pull the string back. The more you pull, the faster the
49:45
the trampoline what's what's called as sciences. Uh the
49:50
faster the projectile, the more you pull, the stronger the projectile is.
49:55
That's why sometimes you pull it too hard. What's the risk when you are
49:59
pulling it too hard that it breaks? That's the break point that an
50:04
entrepreneur is always has to be aware about. I should not pull it too much
50:09
that it breaks only. So it's like saying I go to the gym to make my muscles.
50:13
Obviously the more number of hours I go the the stronger I become faster. But
50:17
you see you can also have a heart attack in case you are working too hard. So
50:20
that's the balance that you got to keep. This business is pulling the string too
50:24
hard. They want to become they want to grow very fast tomorrow. They are
50:28
acquiring customers. They're doing this and that incurring burning stockholders
50:31
money. That's what they are saying on a podium with a lot of crowd. I'm not
50:35
saying this is right. I'm not saying this is wrong. I I'm not saying anything
50:38
about we not getting judgmental as now. But we are saying numbers are showing a
50:41
very ugly picture for now. Are we together on that?
50:46
Okay. All right. Easy. Can we
51:03
people tell me something uh for the drop shipping ventures that you all are going
51:08
to be uh starting are you going to adopt sole proprietorship or partnership as a
51:13
legal form or are you going to adopt LLC as the legal form?
51:20
I'll tell you what may happen if you adopt soul and partnership on one hand
51:25
and you adopt LLC on the other. So today's class is a good eye opener to
51:31
figure out what can happen if I am a sole proprietor or a partnership versus
51:36
how can I be saved if I am an LLC. Okay everybody, do you have this
51:43
framework from morning? Okay. At the end of year two, end of
51:49
year two, can you write the numbers? At the end of year two, you have 2 3
51:57
minutes. Please scribble it down. Is there a way Jonah we can increase the
52:45
AC pressure or cold? Yeah.
53:02
Which is trying to make the room cooler. No. Isn't it very hot? I'm
53:07
kidding. Okay,
53:12
everybody. At the end of year two, how much assets are you left with
53:17
only? How much obligations are you left with?
53:22
And how much equity? 2670. But hey, how did a 20,000 that you had
53:30
put in became a negative 2670? Let's find out.
53:37
You had contributed how much? 20.
53:43
Till the last year, you already had burnt 3920. Correct?
53:49
In the second year, how much was your income?
53:57
In the second year, in the second year, how much was your income? There was only
54:01
one sale transaction. 25,500. And how much were your expenses?
54:08
Can somebody pick up a calculator and total up quickly?
54:12
2,500 11,000.
54:18
11 21
54:22
2150 21 250
54:28
So 2150 is the expense. How much was the income?
54:35
Just 25. This is every startup's income statement. Very little income, huge
54:42
amount of losses. And you know what they say proudly that we are acquiring
54:46
customers. This is a phase where you have to keep patience to us. That's what
54:49
the narrative that startups have with their investors. Investors see their
54:52
money getting burnt but they can't see because startups are proudly saying have
54:56
patience, have patience, have trust, I'll do something. I'm pulling the
54:59
catapult back so that we get a projectile later. Sometimes it happens
55:03
also. That's why investors are keeping that phase. So it's really a big bet
55:07
that people are playing. So how much is the loss that you incur in the second
55:11
year? 18750. Is it is there a question of dividend?
55:17
Owners come in and say, "Hey, how's the work? I want to withdraw something."
55:20
Dude, we are burning. We have burnt all your money. There's nothing to pay you.
55:24
So therefore, dividends are zero. And there is additional 18750 of loss.
55:31
Welcome to year 1. Welcome to year 2. Cumulatively,
55:35
you have burned how much? Can somebody add these two losses together?
55:45
22,670 22,670
55:50
is what you have lost. Year one you lost 320 to zero. Year two
55:56
you lost. This is the first time everybody you see this case is not an
55:59
easy case. That's why we wanted we lost
56:04
expanded. Yeah, good point. Good point. Technical point. Um people this is the
56:08
first time you're looking at two years simultaneously. This is the first time
56:12
you're looking at loss getting increased and heightened. This is the first time
56:16
you're looking at loss being so much that the equity is getting wiped off.
56:21
This is the classic point where a firm should file for bankruptcy.
56:26
This is a classic point where the firm should dissolve itself and say I can't
56:30
do successful business. Just take over quotes. Please take over me. Sell my
56:33
assets. Pay as much as possible to the debt and then I'm going home. This is
56:38
how and when firms file for bankruptcies. Are we together on that?
56:42
Okay. But but startups are tough nuts to crack. Okay. In spite of the world
56:49
telling them that you are not worth it, they say no, I'll tell you. I'll prove
56:52
you wrong. This startup is also trying to do something.
56:56
Let me know anything any problem till here.
57:01
So far so good everybody. Okay. And I'm going to now clean the board a
57:06
bit for the purpose of the next discussion. Everybody, somebody wants to
57:11
take picture with the numbers etc etc. This is the time.
57:20
So the total amount that you need to pay is the loan.
57:23
We as in who? Is 7,000
57:27
plus the no no is 7,000. Obligation is only to
57:31
one loan. Equity is never an obligation. Yeah, but we'll have to pay that
57:35
eventually. No, there is no obligation. Think about
57:38
it. When you give money as equity to any business that money is gone forever. You
57:44
business might pay if lucky. Business may not pay if not lucky. Equity guy can
57:48
never have any whims and fancy against it.
57:52
We write it together. The naming of the heading is wrong. The
57:56
right naming is source of funds. Source of funds.
57:59
Source of funds. That's where the money comes in.
58:01
Now we have to pay back 80,000 plus the 7,000.
58:05
You just have to pay 7,000. What about the loss that we have
58:08
gone? Somebody betted on you. You have burned the money. I'm sorry. I never
58:12
promised to any pay you back. Remember that's the equity funding. So everybody
58:15
when a friend asks you that hey would you want to partner with me in my
58:19
business? Be very careful when you say fine take my money as equity because the
58:23
moment you give your money as equity the business is not giving you any damn
58:27
thing except the ownership. But tell me even if you are the owner of this
58:30
business the money is not going to come back. That's equity game. High risk high
58:35
return. more time.
58:38
Don't worry about it. How much is 2 plus two?
58:41
Yeah, but still that's it. Don't worry about taring.
58:43
Come on. Get the business right. The moment you
58:47
give your money to your friend, fine, let's do something. You drive it and the
58:51
silent partner, it is the most dangerous thing that you're doing. You're giving
58:54
that person the right to burn your money and you can't do anything about it.
58:59
People, that's why contractual obligations are important. Debt is
59:02
safer. At least the business is writing a commitment and say I will pay back.
59:06
That's why these 7,000 people feel relatively still safer than the equity.
59:12
Equity is a blind game altogether. Okay everybody. So I'm going to clean the
59:16
board a bit to have the discussion on the legal forms and this is how it looks
59:20
like right now. People you can drop your pens please. Now you only have to do the
59:27
thinking part. This is how it looks like. This is a
59:31
photograph at the end of which year? Year two. Now the banker called up the
59:38
equity fellow and they said uh Mr. Equity the business deserve to pay me
59:44
how much? 7 and the business have how much?
59:50
4330. There is a shortage of shortage of 2670.
59:55
you better put that money back into the business so that my claim can be paid
59:59
easily. Now this is the point where the legal form matters.
1:00:05
If the legal form of the business is sole proprietor or partnership
1:00:11
then the business uh the debt has the power to call the equity and say I don't
1:00:18
care where you get this 2670 from you better get it now. So how much is the
1:00:24
shortage that debt is facing? 2670. Imagine owners, the poor owners, sle
1:00:30
proprietor owners sold their watches and jewelry etc. Somehow managed to get 2670
1:00:35
and pumped that 2670 into the business. From a business standpoint, isn't it
1:00:41
fundraising from the owner? What happens when you raise money from the owner?
1:00:45
Cash goes up and the money invested in the business
1:00:51
also goes up. plus 2670. Fair point. How would you
1:00:57
think the numbers change? The total assets become equal to
1:01:03
7,000. Liability remains 7,000 and equity becomes now equal to zero.
1:01:11
This is a point where shareholders are bringing as much money which is just
1:01:15
sufficient to make sure that the debts can be paid off. But nonetheless, they
1:01:19
had to sell their personal assets. No, that's the problem with sole proprietor
1:01:23
and partnerships. In case the business suffers any huge loss and their capital
1:01:28
gets wiped off, their personal assets can also be brought to manage the
1:01:32
business losses. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about
1:01:36
it. How much was the total loss of the business?
1:01:39
22670. How much is the capital invested originally?
1:01:44
20,000. 20,000. How much is the I'm using the
1:01:46
word unabsorbed loss? 2600 right 2670 is the unabsorbed loss
1:01:53
that is the problem for equity can the equity uh say no to it in sole
1:01:59
proprietor and partnership they can't say no to it you have to fund the
1:02:02
unabsorbed loss doesn't matter where you bring the money from that's the problem
1:02:06
if you do business as sole and um partnership but are we together on that
1:02:12
now however ever in case your business is 2670.
1:02:25
That's the restated one. Yeah. In case your business is an LLC
1:02:29
and in that case the personal assets have been protected. No business loss
1:02:34
can call for your personal assets. The maximum loss that you can bear is the
1:02:37
amount that you are putting in. How much did you put in as equity? That means
1:02:41
that's the maximum loss that can happen to you. In which case the following will
1:02:45
happen. The banker will give a call to the equity and say I'm short of 2670
1:02:50
fund in the money. The equity guy can always say dude there is a firewall
1:02:53
between my business life and my personal life. Whatever losses I can bear the
1:02:58
maximum amount is already put in. The debt guy will say hey dude but the money
1:03:02
is still falling short. You're still on a negative equity. The LLC will say the
1:03:08
equity can never be negative. But then who is going to bear the loss
1:03:13
of 2670? Unabsorbed one. Mr. Banker, you are going to do it.
1:03:23
You are going to do it. You gave money to somebody and the somebody promised to
1:03:27
pay back. But there is no guarantee there. That fellow is not God. You gave
1:03:31
it to business. You took a calculated risk. The business went down. What to
1:03:34
do? you lose money. Real example, I had some bonds of King Fisher. At one point
1:03:39
in time, India's one of the very luxurious premium carrier. I had given
1:03:43
money as debt holder. King Fisher went down. I get zero amount back. So as the
1:03:49
shareholders, they also did not get anything. The only deal is debt holders
1:03:54
will get before shareholders. There is no guarantee. Business is not God. So
1:03:59
therefore, how would the balance sheet look like? The assets remain there.
1:04:03
shareholder will not pump in any money and the debt holder will have to reduce
1:04:07
their claim. You see equity is personal assets got
1:04:11
saved. You don't have to pump in that kind of money. Are you with me on that?
1:04:16
At this point it matters. Otherwise if the business is profitable we have been
1:04:21
doing so many cases in session four, session five, session six or in all the
1:04:24
cases business has always made profit. In that case it doesn't matter whether
1:04:28
you are LLC or a partnership firm because that exposure to loss has never
1:04:33
come in. Today is the first time that the exposure to loss came in. How much
1:04:37
is the absor unabsorbed loss which is a problem?
1:04:41
2670 is the only problem. 20,000 is anyway the risk capital that equity has
1:04:46
provided. So it's like a commander who is going on war. That's equity
1:04:49
shareholder that you know I'm going on war. I might
1:04:52
get killed but that's okay. That's what you know my way of life is 20,000 is
1:04:57
that commando capital. Okay. All right. Any questions with
1:05:02
regards to LLC versus sole proprietor? Because if no I would
1:05:14
everybody can I take last one minute? We are about
1:05:19
to get over. How are you feeling by the way? Sorry, we had to go at 3:00, but we
1:05:24
just took a little more time. And so, in case your heart is beating
1:05:29
and in case my intentions change, today's class is relatively heavy and I
1:05:37
have always put honesty on the table. It was not that I obliquely hurt anybody.
1:05:41
It was told that it's going to be heavy and all of you are keeping up very well
1:05:45
and by the look from the eyes at least I can say that you have not discarded and
1:05:50
disregarded this concept completely. Obviously these are mature concepts. It
1:05:54
takes a while to get in. We also after so many rounds of teaching have got such
1:05:59
clarity. When we were students we were like there's something like that we are
1:06:02
not very clear. So it's going to take a while. Somebody had to do it for the
1:06:06
first time. We are doing it here for the first time. When we do it second time
1:06:09
you'll feel better. So it is like feeling worse before finally starting to
1:06:13
get better. It is the feeling that you all are having right now. Okay
1:06:17
everybody, nobody jumps off the building is what I'm trying to say. Okay, in the
1:06:21
nutshell. Can somebody please read through this
1:06:26
point number two? This is the last point and then we close in one minute.
1:06:30
Just read the point number two. How will the above change if the new
1:06:38
funding of 5,000 is infused from not the promoter but let's say some PE investor.
1:06:45
So I want to just restate the originals. How much was initial capital? 20
1:06:54
22670 and equity was -2670.
1:06:58
Correct? Such a business was Tesla Motors many
1:07:03
years ago. They were making losses after losses. Imagine electric vehicle is a
1:07:06
hot story for the last 5, seven years, right? More particularly after co but
1:07:10
Tesla motor is not a 5-y year old company. It has been a very long year.
1:07:13
So initially they were making huge losses pretty much like Alibaba, pretty
1:07:17
much like uh you know Khan Academy, you know there's a Khan Academy that is
1:07:21
there in the US online training etc. The first atte so so-called they have made
1:07:25
huge losses and whenever they go to the investor they say dude we have already
1:07:29
burnt somebody's money but are you still willing to bet on it? There is always
1:07:33
some idiot who will say yes. And that idiot is thinking that they will find a
1:07:37
bigger fool than themselves when they have to exit. That's how the valuation
1:07:41
games function. But anyway, we come back. This fellow says, "Fine, 5,000 I
1:07:46
will invest in your venture." What happens when a business raises money
1:07:50
from equity? Can you tell me what changes?
1:07:54
Is it bank balance going up or coming down?
1:07:57
Very good. By 5,000. Is the business making a promise I will
1:08:03
pay back? No, it's a equity investor. Is this the profits that you are
1:08:08
generating? No. It is the capital invested that is going up.
1:08:14
So your in the capital invested becomes 25. Your total loss becomes 22 670 as
1:08:20
before. How will the fundamentals change now?
1:08:24
This put together will be 2 3 3 0. Liability remains same
1:08:34
and the bank balance will be 933
1:08:38
0. This will happen when suddenly the new funding is raised. Equity which was
1:08:44
a negative number till now. Everybody was like shunning it away. Everybody was
1:08:48
like criticizing, getting embarrassed. Suddenly have a positive equity of 2330.
1:08:54
Now the point I'm driving home is whenever you speak to any business,
1:08:57
whenever you want to partner with any business, whenever you want to join as
1:09:00
co-founder and that person says this is how my financials look like, don't stop
1:09:06
at this level. This is the overall equity which is made up of two pockets.
1:09:14
The first pocket is what owner is pumping in. That's called as capital
1:09:18
invested. The second pocket is what business is doing with that money.
1:09:23
That's called reserves. Always always probe further. This 2330 hides the ugly
1:09:30
losses that the business have been generating for the last 2 years. Never
1:09:34
invest on the basis of the final equity only.
1:09:37
Final equity is the sum total of all the funding downs that they have raised. So
1:09:41
we have been taking example of Baijus and one of the Indian companies. They
1:09:44
raised money from equity 13 times. Every time they raise let's say $100 they burn
1:09:50
it. Equity becomes negative. Then they go to another investor. They raise
1:09:53
another money equity becomes positive. Then they again burn the second
1:09:56
investor's money. Then it becomes negative again. That's how 13 times even
1:10:00
a cat has only nine lives. So what were people thinking when they were giving
1:10:05
money to such a firm? Sometimes the loss has to stop. But this is what the
1:10:10
problem with momentum investing. Somebody is such a poster boy of
1:10:14
everybody is following that fellow blindly. But anyways, now this is an
1:10:18
educated class of entrepreneurs. You know that the equity has two pockets. I
1:10:24
want you to I think with the other section we did the same. Everybody start
1:10:27
scribbling. This is something that you cannot go home without learning.
1:10:39
Tab, pen, paper, anything will work. Oops.
1:10:55
Uh, Jonah, can you see why has it gone out?
1:11:06
I think I'll just share the screen, I think.
1:11:18
That's it. Equity holders have Is the font okay?
1:11:27
Equity holders have two pockets in the business.
1:11:36
capital introduced by the people. Let me know what's your
1:13:11
how much of capital introduced by the owners in our case 20,000. How much is
1:13:16
loss is 22670. Always consider the breakout before
1:13:24
taking any people. Do you want to see how good
1:13:30
companies work? One sec. One sec. One sec.
1:13:41
Everybody. Um, is this number is this number visible to you?
1:13:50
There's always a way out. Hang on. Where is the mouse cursor?
1:13:58
Can you figure out the Oh, here I got it. I got it. I got it.
1:14:07
Is this visible now? How much is the total owner's money in
1:14:17
the business for Nvidia? Let's talk about the whole number. 79
1:14:22
79 79 is the total owner's money in the
1:14:25
business. What are those two pockets? 79 is total pocket number one the money
1:14:31
that owners have put in some 11 something. And what is the
1:14:39
reserves that they have generated? 68.
1:14:45
This is the reserve and this is the capital. This is how good companies
1:14:51
behave. They raise money from owners but then
1:14:56
like our startup who is burning you know money after money each year.
1:15:02
So the obviously Nvidia on the first day was not like this but Nvidia on this day
1:15:08
at least is like this. You cannot aim to continue to make loss is the point. You
1:15:14
must have a business plan where there is some line item of a profit showing
1:15:18
somewhere maybe after 5 years and as the world progresses as the tech becomes
1:15:23
important everybody wants results faster. So even investors are losing
1:15:28
patience. Earlier investors were okay that even if a startup for 10 years is
1:15:32
making losses it's okay it's one day it'll make. Today they are not having a
1:15:36
lot of patience. They say show me some profit. No either show me gross profit
1:15:39
or show me operating profit. Show me some profit.
1:15:42
So that's the mindset with which the businesses have to start. All right
1:15:46
everybody let me tell you you guys were absolutely fantastic. Absolutely
1:15:50
fantastic. Good job.

How can we use financial numbers to compare firms and perform time series analysis on different dimensions of the business health, such as enough liquidity
13/10/2025 | 04:15 PM - 05:45 PM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:15
coffee for a subscription. It's a fair deal.
0:30
Morning everybody. So we are going to begin exactly where
0:34
we had left two weeks ago. That's right. Governments are going to
0:41
be graded. So make sure that you log in through your official IDs.
1:04
How you doing? just
1:17
write it down. Oh, I see.
1:30
That's it. The next is going to be even more
1:37
interesting exercise on business planning and forecasting. So, a lot of
1:42
planning stuff. How do you forecast a business? Uh sales forecasting, cost
1:46
forecasting and stuff like this. It's pretty interesting. Yeah.
1:51
Are we ready everybody? Should we begin?
1:57
Heat. Heat.
2:22
I think we are good to begin. Yeah. All right. Let's go to it. Let's
2:26
go. Let me remind you, no marks for getting
2:31
it faster. Only marks for getting it right.
2:42
To which stakeholder? Only equity. Equity as well as debt.
2:48
Only debt. All right. All right.
3:13
So, I have a good news and a bad news. Which one would you want to hear first?
3:19
Okay. Bad first. Still, there are 13 people who think that even debt, the
3:25
banks take away our share of profit. Absolutely no. They only get the
3:29
promised return which is we call it interest. Whatever residual profit is
3:34
belongs to the shareholders. That's the bad news that 13 people still feel it.
3:39
You want to hear the good news? More number of people here in this room
3:45
compared to the previous section feel that it's only equity.
3:50
So something to look up to. Okay. Yeah. Let's move on. the mic.
3:58
Huh? The audio is not working. Yeah. Now, now mic is pretty fine. Yeah.
4:04
Okay. Read it carefully. Opening value of machine was 1,000. You
4:11
bought another one. Used 10% perom.
4:17
For what? Perom.
4:20
Per year. Well,
4:50
that was quick. That was quick. I understand. We should have given like 10
4:53
15 more seconds to it. Um, see 150 can't be the answer. Why?
5:02
15 it has been used. Brilliant answer. So 150 is imagine you had a machine, you
5:07
bought another one and you did not use it. Then the value of the closing is
5:11
going to be 150. Good answer. 140 135 also. Is there anybody who got
5:17
137.5? How do you get it? We are. And then we take the person out.
5:26
No, but then that's right. That's right. But how?
5:36
You need to do the proator. Yeah.
5:42
Yeah. Sure. Sure. So, no, no, no. what he's saying sometimes what happens is
5:47
and in today's class that's going to happen a lot that what you think you
5:51
have to also express it in as many words so maybe you know what he's got in his
5:54
mind is right the point is that $100 of anybody like
5:59
to try else yeah $100 was used the whole year
6:03
very% goes down to 10% it becomes a 90 and 50 years so
6:11
so full year depreciation was $5. Half your depreciation is 2.5. So a $50
6:19
machinery becomes a 47.5. $100 became a 90. You add the two, you
6:25
get 137.5. But I agree that was a little quick.
6:30
But still a lot of people got it. But
6:44
these are the people with whom you have to compete.
6:48
I know. I know. I take your point. No, you also got it right. You got it.
6:58
Okay. Okay. Okay, let's see everybody. Let's see.
7:06
When a business borrows money from bank and buys a machinery from it,
7:15
cash from financing, cash from investing. You have time. You have a lot
7:19
of time. Come on. Come on. Come on.
7:37
How cool is that? How cool is that?
7:50
See if you borrowing money from financing.
7:56
Very good. Because there are two activities that you're doing. Number
7:59
one, going to the bank and raising money. So therefore, your bank balance
8:01
goes up. But under which head? Operating, investing or financing?
8:05
Therefore, CFF increases. But then you use the cash to buy a machine and which
8:09
head goes down? Investing goes down. So while the net cash balance is still a
8:15
zero, the different heads will show an inflow versus an outflow. Okay. All
8:21
right. Let's see. Please read it carefully. Please read it
8:28
carefully. During the year, you pay 1,200. By the
8:32
end of the year, 250 is prepaid. How much is the consumption?
8:40
Come on, get this right. Come on.
9:09
Heat. Come to terms with it. This discussion
9:22
what you're doing is important. Come to terms with it.
9:26
Yeah. Questions. It is. It is.
9:49
What did you get? How much did you get out of these?
10:02
Which one? So this year's cash flow is next year's
10:07
income. No, that's No. So if he pays if he pays 1.250
10:16
I thought that 250 was paid last year. Last year they paid 250 extra.
10:20
Where does it say 250 is used when you say
10:26
but see generally when you are talking about it that you see um I just paid
10:32
term 2 and 250 is prepaid. No, you're referring
10:37
to the prepayment out of the payment that it's contextual
10:42
people. You will be dealing with stakeholders out of coffee meetings.
10:45
It's not going to be an academic setting and you can't say spell it out like a
10:49
question. You have to draw inference from the linguistic language that people
10:53
are using you know out of context. So again going back and explaining this
10:58
point um remember we said that expense is consumption and payment is an outflow
11:04
of money both may not be always same. So here the business is actually making
11:09
payment of the cash goes down to the extent of 1200 that was very clear but
11:13
out of that 250 is prepaid. Prepaid means for the previous year you're
11:17
paying for the next year for the next year. That means how much do you deserve
11:22
to pay for the current year? The difference of the two papa you pay
11:29
1200 right and 250 for next year so 950 for current year think about it
11:36
more I get your point I 100% get your point
11:39
time can be increased from tomorrow I get
11:43
especially for the previous one I thought that you know the machine
11:46
calculations etc etc was like pretty fast but I think here the confusion that
11:50
would have cropped up is what is and are we the business are we the you're always
11:55
a business. So think about it, okay? Simply and I'm going to put uh it in
11:59
your context. Imagine you all are in the month of February. Okay, it is term two
12:05
for all of you. You are talking to each other. I just paid the fees to better
12:11
and 250 is prepaid. So is this 250 for term three or term one? You're in term
12:18
two already. You're saying 250 is prepaid. So 250 must be for term three
12:23
or term one. Term three.
12:29
250. So they say 250. No. No. But the point is see the context
12:34
is going to be here, right? This year.
12:41
Where does it say last year? No, no, no. That's the wrong
12:46
interpretation. See, you're saying um here is my payment out of which It was
12:51
last year. Where does it say last year?
12:54
It implies that it was prepaid. Prepaid. Very good. And you can prepay
12:58
even today for tomorrow. You can prepay yesterday for today.
13:02
It's a circular function, right? And no. And but you see read the read
13:08
the language a bit. You're saying business pays 1200. 250 is prepaid.
13:15
Does it say 250 was prepaid? 250 is prepaid.
13:26
No, that was a No, no, no, no. Surange, that was a question. Consumption, we
13:29
can't choose. No question. Yeah.
13:36
250 is free. Correct. It is very simple. It is very
13:41
simple. Okay. Just take it easy. Just take it easy. Easy. Calm down. Calm
13:47
down. So there are two things happening. Number one, number one people here we
13:52
are accountants maybe but out in the world we are business people. You have
13:55
to draw the sense out of the average language that people use. Think about it
14:00
that way. I made a payment of $100. 200 let's I made a payment of $100. 20
14:08
was prepaid. How much do you think is the food that I would have consumed?
14:13
80. 20 must be utilized tomorrow. Are you with me on that?
14:18
Yes. I think what's confusing is that the food is still worth 100. No, you've
14:23
just paid less. But the food is still worth whatever the cost of the food is.
14:27
Even if you pay 80, you're paying 20 tomorrow.
14:31
That would have been outstanding. George,
14:34
that would have been outstanding. It isn't like this. If I buy one watch
14:37
and I buy it, let's say for like $100, but actually was only 80. So they keep
14:45
correct. It is exactly that's it. That's exactly it.
14:49
That's exactly the point. Exactly the point. Okay, let's go. Let's
14:53
go. Okay, everybody. Let's see. Okay, now take it easy.
15:00
Paying versus consumption, expense versus payment.
15:08
Only two options. Liquidity is more than profitable. Liquidity is less than
15:10
profitability. You have 9 seconds. Easy.
15:23
What? How many people got this one right?
15:36
Okay. Can can somebody explain why would liquidity be less than profitability?
15:42
Yes sir. Because that's it. Your cash is going to go out
15:49
worth full entire consignment. Let's say in in the previous section um somebody
15:55
was showing some kind of a you know box in which there was lot of you know the
15:59
goods that they had to sell. So there are 10 units in it and that fellow has
16:02
paid for entire 10 units. cash has gone out but that fellow has not used all 10
16:08
units. The things are still with him. He has just sold let's say two out of them.
16:12
So consumption is the portion that we use that we consume. Payment is the
16:18
entire amount that you've gone out. So you're paying for 10 but you're
16:21
consuming only two. So obviously your profits go down to the extent of two.
16:24
Cash goes out to the extent of full 10. Liquidity is much lower than the
16:28
profitability. This is going to happen with each one of us. each and every one
16:33
of us who's going to get into the let's say any kind of venture etc because as a
16:37
startup your suppliers won't give you credit you'll have to pay them up front
16:42
so cash goes out of the pocket immediately entire consignment but you
16:47
will sell them gradually one by one and therefore at that moment your
16:51
profitability is going to be not as you know much as the liquidity suddenly
16:56
drops down the money availability in cash terms is most critical most
17:01
critical Okay, let's go. Let's see who stands
17:04
where. 29146. Well done. Oh, I thought you are
17:10
the one. All right. 290.
17:14
My bad. What was that number? 29 91. Well done. And 29124.
17:22
How come on everything three four people are raising hands?
17:26
1 2 2 9124. Well done.
17:33
29. Which number are you on?
17:39
Fourth. Oh, I see. I see. Yes. George.
17:43
How is the gra? Is it just all of them over the whole
17:49
thing? I did quite bad.
18:01
So pretty good. Yeah, it's 60%.
18:10
Each cahoot is graded after week two and onward. So week one was ungraded. Week
18:16
two we conducted four cohorts and this week we are going to conduct four more
18:22
or maybe three. So in total let's say there are seven
18:27
participation. No.
18:30
No. So out of seven we'll take best of five.
18:33
Okay. Something like that. So sometimes you
18:35
know people will miss out. Yeah. For the app.
18:38
Best of five is what we will take. Can we have the previous I'm not asking
18:42
for the future. Can we have the list of previous?
18:44
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Can't you access them on the
18:48
LMS? No.
18:49
No. You must have. Okay. So maybe we Okay. Okay. So, we'll give you that.
18:53
We'll give you that. Okay. Everybody, so I want to play a quick video.
18:58
And before that, before that project, everybody,
19:03
please do not be absent on Friday. 30% grading activity is scheduled.
19:14
So, what happened? This is not an exam.
19:18
It's just that it's graded, you know. It's not an exam. Come on. Me
19:23
take it. Come on. What are you saying? So this is
19:28
what I want you to go through it. You have to create posters. You have to
19:35
create infographic. You have to create something. No great. Come on. You can
19:38
use chat gibbies and stuff like that. That's an exam.
19:40
Oh god. You see now
19:45
smiling. What group is it?
19:50
No, we will create groups randomly. Yes,
19:55
we will give you the companies. We will give you the group members. We will give
20:00
you 75 minutes. You have to calculate the ratios. We will learn them
20:07
tomorrow. All of that. Yeah.
20:13
Same same stuff. Okay. So, Excel file and then you have to create an
20:18
infographic. I'm also giving you the weightage where you have to put the
20:21
effort and finally you have to kind of create a narrative. All of these we will
20:27
learn today, tomorrow and on Thursday. Everybody just go through it. Ask any
20:33
question that is coming to your mind. There is no backup to this. Your app
20:37
it's a group assignment. It's a group assignment. Good thing if
20:40
your group member is is is a very proficient member, you gain. But in case
20:46
that group member goofs up, entire group goofs up.
20:50
There are no individual components. No, no, we will make the team inform
20:57
you. We have to do it in class.
20:59
Do it in the class itself. No, it's so boring.
21:11
that I don't know about the reflection quiz. I think some people are saying
21:14
that it's been pushed out to December but I'm not sure about it. I wasn't
21:19
aware it's next week. I have created the quiz and they will just conduct it on a
21:23
day where they feel is comfortable. Okay everybody any question here? Yes. Andrea
21:31
so like the same thing but maybe other questions so you can like
21:35
practice. Yeah. like not the examples like the
21:39
actual questions or the case study or the actual numbers but the same thing
21:43
just numbers different question
21:51
Andrea I'm giving you the question right here
21:55
it is exactly the it's what you don't know is the firm that you will be
22:02
working on you want that also
22:09
You want the foam also? Anything else on the sidelines? Burger,
22:14
pizzas, anything? No.
22:21
Okay. All right. Everybody sort it. Yeah.
22:25
Program team people. You see don't uh Well, we will we will bring you out
22:33
of the hospital. I we'll bring you out of the class.
22:37
We'll bring you out of the hypothetical nursing home.
22:42
We'll figure out we'll figure out. Uh so for all of these things, you have to
22:46
speak to the program team. Okay, everybody. These are the institutees
22:48
policy. One trainer cannot really change it. You know, we will not give
22:52
discounts. Whatever institute says we will follow. You will follow. That's the
22:55
policy basis. Okay everybody? So it's it's video time everybody. This week is
23:00
going to be very very very different than what we had uh in the previous two
23:03
weeks. And I wanted to prove can we close the lights a bit and we create
23:08
like a movie theater. Okay everybody, you have to be very very
23:13
attentive for next 2 and 1/2 minutes. Let's see.
25:02
Heat. Heat.
25:26
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
25:50
Heat. Heat.
26:09
Yeah. Heat.
26:25
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
26:46
Yeah. Heat.
26:58
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
27:26
Heat. Heat. drugs without
27:44
the police don't consult. That
27:50
was amazing. the mic on as well. So today, tomorrow
28:18
and on Thursday we are going to divide the whole reading the financials
28:24
of financial numbers into three parts. Number one, we are going to learn how do
28:28
you make sense of numbers very top of the order. Okay. Second, tomorrow we
28:34
will get our hands dirty on ratio calculation ourselves. Now you and I are
28:38
living in an era where chat GBTS and Google finances and Yahoo Finance
28:42
calculate the ratio for us. But it's always a good idea to know how what is
28:45
working on the back end of it. So that comes tomorrow and on Thursday is where
28:49
we will learn the most difficult thing the art of building the narrative. Okay,
28:54
building a narrative especially means let's say creating a let's say a pitch
28:58
deck for yourself or you know kind of preparing for an elevator sales pitch.
29:02
How do you communicate what you saw? Okay, so Sherlock Holmes the video was
29:07
basically to kind of give you a sense of what the role of a person called as
29:12
analyst is. So analyst is pretty much like a consulting detective where you go
29:18
to the scene after murder has been done and you are just drawing conjectures as
29:23
to who could be the murder. So you're using you're very humble that way.
29:27
You're not paying God. You're using words like who could have been what
29:31
could have happened because you're not sure about it and therefore there is a
29:34
lot of logical and analytical work which is going in your mind. still you are not
29:39
very sure about it and then there are some people who said you know you're
29:42
being so why why are you templatizing everybody why are you creating you know
29:45
this is so cliche etc but templates always work so therefore today also
29:50
we're going to kind of work on you know some nine different crimes not nine
29:53
actually seven seven different crime scenes with some pointed questions at it
29:57
so I want to quickly begin by giving you some of the very basics from term one
30:02
and term two and I don't have much time for it tell me uh I'm going to pick up a
30:06
phrase from here and you have to tell me The meaning you understand the question
30:09
you have to tell me the meaning the phrase the first I'm picking is net
30:13
profit what is the meaning of net profit the money in the business after expenses
30:21
no half right half wrong after expenses is right but money in the business means
30:25
equity money in the business means assets
30:29
income huh so what you're giving is a formula
30:34
you're right but I am asking for meaning is different than formula All right.
30:40
Money that is left actually.
30:46
All right. Okay. And is that profit after retire?
30:50
After after the money generated by the business in financial year.
30:56
Money generated by the business in the financial year. Okay.
30:59
People you know why are we doing this exercise? Because on Thursday we will
31:03
give you 10 investors question and they will not ask questions in terms of tell
31:08
me gross profit margin, tell me net profit margin. They will give you some
31:12
open-ended business problem and you need to connect the dot. Oh investor was
31:16
talking about that they must be meaning this that connect has to be very very
31:19
strong. So net profit is the final value addition done by the business during the
31:24
year after all expenses have been met. Is it cumulative or is it periodic?
31:30
Profit. periodic important point every year you generate the profit okay next
31:34
next phase that I'm picking up and for startups it is most important gross
31:38
profit what is gross profit also called as contribution margin what is gross
31:43
profit I want I know the formula I know the formula don't give me that I need
31:47
meaning of gross profit or meaning of
31:52
contribution margin come on use in case you want to
32:00
You're giving the formula money that is left in a little
32:07
how much more you very close
32:12
people you see you're getting stuck you understand that but you all of you need
32:16
the capability to explain it also in your life as entrepreneurs you will need
32:21
minimum thousand more than that stakeholders you have to explain your
32:25
business proposition over maybe sometimes in a lift Sometimes on a
32:29
coffee discussion, sometimes while you're waiting for the airline queue,
32:32
you have to just explain, have the capability to explain what is gross
32:36
profit. How much you make of trading goods?
32:39
Brilliant answer. Brilliant answer. It is a basic trade profit. Nobody is
32:45
saying that's your final take-home. But it's like by trading goods, how much do
32:47
I make up? That's it. Brilliant answer. Next important phrase. What is operating
32:52
profits? No, operating profit is right here.
32:58
Gross profit is right here. There are so many expenses in between
33:02
that you're giving the full form. No, correct. Earning before interest and tax
33:08
income. Good point. So, what is operating profit people? You must have
33:11
capability to to be able to explain all of that. Come on. You want to try
33:19
the profit that you get after the daily like regular stuff.
33:23
Brilliant. The profit that you get after paying off all the daily stuff. That's a
33:29
brilliant non-commerce interpretation of operating profit. Full marks people.
33:34
That's what you will deal with. People who are not from accounting background.
33:37
You have to explain it like it's a 5-year-old. Okay. Good answers
33:41
everybody. Okay. Next. Explain what is CFO to me? What is CFO? I know the full
33:47
form cash perform operations. What is the meaning of CFO?
33:50
Money used for daily operations. Profits for also money. This is also
33:53
money. You see the cash. Yeah.
33:57
Correct. The money that you're able to generate the cash that you're able to
34:00
generate out of your daily operations. What is CFF?
34:04
kind of the cash that you're able to
34:13
only debt I could hear only debt I missed something
34:16
owner's money also what are they together called as
34:19
equity and debt equity and debt together are called as
34:25
equity and debt together are called as simpler it's simpler it's simpler than
34:34
that you're taking too much stress. Imagine he's equity I am debt for teta
34:38
and tet will say who are standing stakeholders investors
34:45
investors stakeholder employees also a stakeholder stakeholder is anybody who
34:49
can be impacted by the business and who can impact the business on the other
34:52
hand so very frankly em is a stakeholder for teta emity has nothing to do with
34:57
the investments in teta are we together on there so that's your CFF cash flow
35:02
tell you something if CFF is positive you're raising money You are repaying
35:06
money. If CFF is positive, you're raising money
35:10
or repaying money. Raising money. Okay. When would you be
35:13
raising money? Either start of the business or
35:18
or expansion or deficit. Brilliant. Now, which of these
35:23
three must be the situation? I don't know. That's exactly why you need to go
35:27
to the crime scene. That's exactly what an analyst has to do. So the brilliant
35:32
answer came from Joshua you know George Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh
35:34
Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Josh Joshua who was
35:35
distributing the chips he said uh in analysis don't you think every good
35:39
answer begins with it depends like yeah quite like it it depends it could be
35:43
anything else okay so on so forth all right everybody and this is the third
35:47
financial statement we looked back immediately preceding session 8 where we
35:50
made a balance sheet we said this side is what you see is the different kind of
35:54
assets long-term some short-term these are like the capital structure and these
35:58
are some operational obligations by the way do you recall operating investing
36:01
financing. Okay. And uh I couldn't take that chance with the previous section
36:06
but because you guys did so well in cahoot and therefore I can and believe
36:09
it. Do you also remember the sixstep framework of doing business by Elon
36:14
Musk? Step A. Step a blue box you raise money. Step B
36:22
you spend money. Your shop step now the customers marketing etc. Customer walks
36:27
in. Step C expenses. Step D. C minus D was profit. You can do two things with
36:32
it. You reinvest back or you give it back to the investors. All right,
36:37
everybody. Um, quick question. Why do we analyze it all? Because we have a
36:41
decision to make. It's not like a free time past hobby. Quick point. Didn't you
36:46
analyze Tet before saying a yes? Yes. Okay. Didn't I analyze Tet before saying
36:52
a yes? Yes. But your analysis and my analysis was very very different because
36:59
you as customers were looking at something else and I as supplier was
37:04
looking at something else people very frankly and because we are
37:10
accounts and finance so we know the business and all of that I don't care
37:14
whether Tetar lives beyond 6 months as long as my services are paid my job's
37:20
done but you do care you see the Therefore your way of and your questions
37:26
and your data points that you need for analysis of the same entity called as TA
37:30
is going to be different than my analysis. You don't have to take cash
37:34
from TA. So you are not going to look at the bank balance. I have to take cash
37:37
from data. I will look at the bank balance. Then what you want to find out
37:42
is different for every stakeholder. That's all right. But you see my
37:50
immediate problem is not four years. My immediate problem is my some you know
37:54
services have been taken the money is you do you have the money in your pocket
37:57
or not? So liquidity is what is primary thing on my mind. I would love in case
38:01
you know teta grows and they become 10fold and blah blah blah etc. But
38:04
that's a longer drawn thing. Immediate moment when the t contacted me and say
38:09
we'd like you to kind of go to Dubai and kind of do the first thing is you know
38:14
obviously we can't ask that blently but you know the thing that I mind is that
38:18
you know do you have enough cash in your pocket so on and so forth you never ask
38:22
this question because you are the one who give cash to them they don't give
38:25
cash to you. So every stakeholder will have a different impact. You see all the
38:30
employees at TETA they always look at the fundamentals of TA because they want
38:35
to look at the impact on the wages during COVID times you know whether the
38:40
company will strike me off you know whether they will cut down the pay so
38:43
every stakeholder has something to do with you know those financial analysis
38:47
and this is where the first crime scene begins everybody this is a group
38:50
exercise make sure that you're sitting with somebody this is what you see
38:55
nothing more nothing less and these are the three questions that you to answer.
38:59
You have 3 minutes to process the information, speak to somebody sitting
39:05
next to you and then we begin with an open house.
39:09
We have seven cases like this. Make sure you have the energy to go to the seventh
39:14
one as well. This is the crime scene.
39:24
Read the questions carefully. people once you have make made up some
39:40
points in your mind make sure that you speak even Sherlock Holmes needed a Dr.
39:45
Watson just remember that Boston.
40:22
Obviously, you need a lot of more data. Obviously,
40:36
if this was a 10 year data would have been better, but this is what you have.
40:39
Make as much sense as possible. As analyst, you're always ringing fence.
40:43
You're always controlled by the data that you get. It's not always enough. So
40:47
everybody please make sure that you're speaking to the person next for next 60
40:51
seconds minimum. We don't want you know brilliant individual entrepreneurs. We
40:56
need good team workers. Sri speak to the person sitting next to you here to Dr.
41:02
Watson. Heat. Heat.
41:29
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
41:49
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
42:36
30 more seconds everybody. 30 more seconds.
42:42
No, no, just wait for 30 more seconds. everything.
43:10
All right, let's begin everybody. And I want to just begin by asking the
43:15
third question. No debate right now. Is it fair to praise the management for a
43:18
good job? Yes or a no? How many people feel yes? How many
43:23
people feel no? Yeah. Now that's a good house to interact with. Go to question
43:27
number one. How has the company performed? Good or bad?
43:33
How many feel good? It's actually maintained.
43:36
And how many feel it's bad? Okay. I want to hear the good things about the firm
43:41
first. Good things. Tell me the good things. Good things.
43:44
Sales inreased. Sales increased. Okay. First good thing.
43:48
Sales have gone up. Second profits. That's it.
43:54
Every basic purpose of the business is to generate profit and the business is
43:57
generating profit. That's a good thing. Why are you undermining that? What else
44:00
is a good thing? Sales is increasing. Okay. Profits are there. Point number
44:07
two. Any other good thing about the firm?
44:09
The expense to sales ratio g. So it means
44:13
the profit ratio expenses have gone down in sales.
44:18
Which expense is going down? Uh the marketing sales So,
44:23
now this is year 1, year two, and year three.
44:26
Oh, yeah. So, this is the oldest year. This is the
44:29
recent post here. That's exactly the opposite of what you
44:36
said. So, you gave the other parties something.
44:39
Yeah. Yeah. It's is this way. Okay. Why bad? One of the bad things about
44:45
mobile but you see you're basically answering
44:53
the second point every level of expensive increase but don't you think
44:56
the company size have gone up if you see last time there were two
45:02
sections in Teta and this time there are four sections
45:07
why do you think there are four sections what is the basic reason
45:11
students more business. So when you look at faculty payment obviously faculty
45:16
payment this year is more but because there is greater work greater output
45:21
greater scale two things one good thing is from year 1 to year two we had a
45:26
increase in the gross profit margin uh where do you see gross profit margin
45:31
okay margin is what you brought up okay
45:38
profit margin margin is again you're bringing Anything
45:44
in the base data? Any bad thing in the base data? Bad thing
45:53
by 12 times instead of increase.
45:59
Okay. All right. So good performed. So I want to just I want to just uh come back
46:04
on the word perform. Which parameter? Imagine you had so little time. You can
46:10
pick up just one parameter. Out of all of them, you got to figure out
46:14
somebody's performance. Which parameter will you pick up? Net profit. The first
46:19
parameter for performance is always the net profit. Imagine you had one more
46:24
minute. Which parameter will you pick up second? Your focus is on performance.
46:29
Which parameter will you pick up second? Sales. Brilliant. Sales or revenue or
46:34
whatever it may call. You have one more additional minute. Which parameter will
46:39
you pick up third? Now if you are a startup then you may
46:45
not be profitable at this level but you still have to focus. So for a startup it
46:49
is the gross profit otherwise it is the operating profit which is the third most
46:55
important layer when you look at the performance of a firm and within the
47:00
three there could be very very you know diverging signals. That's what we will
47:04
pick up tomorrow and the day after but today is like a top of the order thing.
47:07
Okay. Next. So the CEO called up a meeting with member one, member two,
47:13
member three, member four and member five, tax officer, finance officer,
47:20
factory head, marketing officer and production head. All of all five members
47:27
CEO started to lampoon trash them. What are you guys doing under your watch? The
47:32
expenses are going up so much. What is the obvious defense the all five of them
47:36
will pick up? they're more business then the CEO is now left confused that you
47:41
know how do I find out the real of concern because everybody says more
47:43
business means more expense how do I figure it out what is a way to then
47:47
counter the argument of more business means more expense
47:51
it's not proportionally it's not proportionally so what CEO did
47:55
is to sorry but let's
47:59
per drop catch dropped catcher
48:07
like per and then we can just see how the product is more expensive
48:14
as a result. Fantastic. So one is some kind of a denominator is what we need
48:19
some kind of a scaler some kind of a reference point we need. So one
48:22
reference point could be the number of units that you have but generally you
48:25
see imagine it's apple where the different units are of different price
48:29
points then the value becomes a good scaler. So you see what is changing here
48:35
the size of the business. So the CEO decided to I'm using the word common
48:42
size. Common size means you see uh the factory
48:46
said so obviously 180 is a good number for 300 but you know since the size of
48:50
the business went up how do you arrive at this 62% can you tell me that 62%.
48:58
Pick up a calculator everybody. Will you pick up a calculator? Very good.
49:02
Fantastic. So, how do you arrive at 186 divided by a 300? Can you tell me how
49:08
much is that? 62%.
49:11
62%. Okay. Now, how do you interpret that as a point? How do you interpret
49:15
that as a point? If 300 worth of sales, your cost of
49:20
goods sold was 186. But then you are now not focusing on 300. You're saying let
49:24
assume 300 was equal to 100. On every $100 of sales, year 62 went out as
49:32
product cost in the first year. How much is the number parallel number in the
49:38
third year? 720 out of 1,200. Can you tell me the number is a 60%. So tell me
49:44
has the factory guy done a good job or a bad job? Has job done actually a good
49:49
job? In economics you have studied a phenomena which answers this which is
49:53
that when your scale goes up you experience what? Economies of steal.
49:58
Economies of scale means what? What goes down?
50:02
Cost goes down. Cost goes down. So you see the cost going down and therefore
50:06
profits are going up. That's exactly what you see. Are you together on that?
50:11
And then uh tax guy also said the same thing that you see over a period of time
50:15
from an 8% of the to line my cost is only 5%. So you are having some kind of
50:21
a saviors also with you. 100% I I'll come to I'll come to you in
50:28
a minute. Now can you now identify the main areas of concern the expenses which
50:32
are eating up the maximum. How would you interpret this four versus a 13?
50:37
Interpretation is important everybody. 2 years ago if you were selling goods
50:42
worth 100 four had to be spent to generate the demand.
50:48
Now in year three if you have to sell something worth 100 how much have to be
50:53
spent to generate demand? 13 that means the company's brand is getting built or
50:58
getting destroyed. That means marketing wise is not doing a great job. So on and
51:02
so forth. So this is the one of the biggest elephant in the room who is
51:06
eating away your profits. People think about it while at the absolute you look
51:11
like 55 is becoming a 126 management. Good job done. But actually it is not a
51:15
good job done. Think about it. Your sales is four times out of economies of
51:21
scale. basic logic your cost will not increase by the same logic that means
51:26
your profitability I am using the word carefully not profit but profitability
51:30
relative profits should increase rather than reduce look at what has happened an
51:35
18% has come down you have lost 7% of margins from an 18% you have become an
51:42
11% that means something's wrong and I'm going to use a line which is going to
51:47
hit hard can I say that it is the inefficient efficiency and inflation
51:53
which is taking over the benefits of economies of scale.
51:58
Can I say that? So economies of scale is one of the phenomena in economics but
52:01
that doesn't mean it's a given. Every factor will experience it. There are a
52:05
lot of times inefficiencies that crop in. Marketing is a classic example.
52:10
Depreciation is a classic example. You're losing 3% of profitability out of
52:14
usage of machinery. You might not be using it that well. So therefore as a
52:19
reader of the financial data the key take-home of this crime scene that I
52:24
took you all is sometimes base data don't throw the full picture you need to
52:28
common size it come tomorrow we will actually do the common sizing on a
52:32
particular case okay more questions you can't put a picture
52:37
100% of there's more
52:43
100% you are right sir 100% I agree But therefore I said you know Joshua
52:49
made in one point it depends and you see in the previous class in the previous
52:55
section okay the toughy guy who has been buying subscriptions okay anyway um good
53:01
sales guy absolutely sales have to be like that what is the inhibition you
53:05
can't ego and sales can't you know coexist anyway that's not the point I'm
53:09
driving home is everybody when Sherlock Holmes reached the murder scene is he
53:14
damn sure about a particular persons as a as a murderer. No, there's always
53:18
conjecture. It depends so on so forth. There are some templates that you will
53:22
have to fix and that's just help you get closer to the reality and there you kind
53:28
of you know take some risk and can do all it's a cognitive exercise up here.
53:32
So while accounting was irritating, analysis was heavy. Analysis is going to
53:38
feel heavy and I can guarantee by the end of this class today it will start
53:42
feeling a lot heavier to you that you know um finally I need a break kind of
53:47
that is the right emotion for an analysis. Accounting was very very
53:50
transactional. Can you this is a case can you calculate bank balance? Can you
53:53
calculate profit balance that was so simple and last week I told you that we
53:57
will begin exactly with a balance sheet or an income statement being given to
54:00
you. This week my problem is not whether you are able to calculate these numbers.
54:04
This week my problem is are you able to read those numbers or not. When a CEO
54:09
says you know my my cash flows from operations are going down. Do you really
54:14
interpret what cash flow from operation means? So on and so forth. That's the
54:17
psyche with which you need to approach this week. We have four classes out of
54:21
which one goes away in project only three classes we have including today.
54:26
So just imagine after today there are two more days of learning. Tomorrow is
54:30
going to be mathematical ratio analysis and day after is going to be very very
54:34
difficult the narrative building of it and we will use tragicity and all of
54:38
that why not of course those are the tools available why should we not use it
54:41
but we should use the tools not as they are our masters but we are theirs there
54:48
is a difference in the orientation when you use chat GPD and I'm so glad that I
54:54
am speaking to the last generation of students who had NI to handle AI. What
54:59
is NI? Natural intelligence.
55:04
To handle artificial intelligence, you need to have some natural intelligence.
55:09
Otherwise, you will become their slaves. Today, a school kid, a let's say a
55:15
school kid in the second grade says, I want to write a poem on let's say some
55:19
world leader. The fellow has no clue about it. Whatever AI gives, that's the
55:25
rule. For all of you while you were in school, AI was not there. You have been
55:30
given the hard way of the training and all of that you are the last generation
55:34
on this planet earth who can really challenge AI's point. How do you know AI
55:39
is giving us the wrong answer? Because somebody knows the right answer. Imagine
55:44
next generation would not even know the right answers or the wrong answer.
55:47
Whatever the he says. and they say by
56:13
the profit then also increase by four 100%
56:18
easy by saying that then cost expenses go up but is that too easy or would it
56:23
also be okay so it's a good starting point
56:26
it's a good starting point and then you have to Go find.
57:20
What is the cause of concern? What is the cause of concern?
57:28
Gross profit going down. George, it's not the best of the answers. That's not
57:32
the concern. What I'm trying to say is okay countering George's point when you
57:36
go when when when you go to the doctor and say I'm running fever then doctor is
57:41
not worried about the fever fever is a symptom the problem is some virus which
57:45
is inside you never can I say you never tabulate profits you always tabulate
57:49
your revenues and cost profit is a balancing figure automatically is it
57:53
fair to say so thank fantastic so what is the problem
57:59
no not the operating income what is the problem
58:02
the Cost of production is the problem. That is the real problem which is
58:08
pulling the profits down. Because George, this is the reason
58:17
that's the main reason and effect.
58:26
operating. You see the reason for operating income
58:30
to go down or the gross profit to go down is because the cost of production
58:34
is going up. Now may I ask you a question? Imagine who knows this is
58:38
Tesla Motors. Why do you think cost of production has gone up?
58:44
What do you think cost of production has gone up? Is it is it like a normal
58:48
marginal increase or is it like a steep giant increase?
58:52
You see an 82% doesn't become 95 like that. 13% profitability gone. What do
58:58
you think could have could be the reason such as
59:03
you see it depends depends on what raw material prices
59:10
geopolitical. Okay. And
59:15
labor prices. Okay. Some kind of a labor union problem. This and that. And but
59:20
then for labor but then but then for labor you'll have to also figure out out
59:24
of this how much is material component and how much is labor component.
59:31
Correct. Absolutely. But you see now comes to the point generally
59:35
inefficiency crops up gradually and it is not to the extent of like 82 becoming
59:40
a 95 you know. So that's where the Sherlock Holmes comes into the picture.
59:47
It is efficiency also. But can inefficiency erode 13% generally from
59:54
from tariffs some imported components. So suddenly there's 100% import tariffs
59:58
and stuff like that. Some reason out of that. Okay. Yes sir.
1:00:04
Now diseconomies of scale can also kick in. Brilliant point. Brilliant point.
1:00:08
You might have to open up another factory to handle the greater you know
1:00:13
volumes and therefore greater fixed cost and all of that. You see there are so
1:00:16
many factors you guys have given. Let me give you a bad news. Financial
1:00:20
accountant does not give you all the reasons. It only starts the conversation
1:00:25
like all of you have done it. To probe all of them you need to have another
1:00:29
kind of a set of datas from an annual report for company website from you know
1:00:33
companies managements and so on so forth. But at least a trigger point has
1:00:36
happened. Are you together on that? Okay.
1:00:42
Second cause of concern Fantastic.
1:00:48
Fantastic. I knew this section is special. You guys got it so quickly.
1:00:53
What is the problem here? What is the problem here? Aren't you
1:01:01
happy that you're earning this income? No.
1:01:05
That's the point. Somebody, you know, from a student point of view, learning
1:01:10
guitar is not operating. studying, learning entrepreneurship,
1:01:14
taking risk, all those modules are the primary job. How much time do you think
1:01:18
a company should devote on the non-operational side?
1:01:22
As less as possible, 1%, 2%. That's the average of let's say
1:01:27
top 50 count of 50 companies of the world. They just get 2% from their
1:01:32
nonoperational activity. And we human beings can learn so much from the
1:01:35
corporates about the focus. So imagine 40% of the time is going somewhere which
1:01:46
is nonoperational. Why do you think this must be the case? What could have
1:01:51
happened? Yeah, because
1:01:54
main like what they sell is gone like so hard to sell to Teslas for example. Say
1:01:59
people people hate Elon Musk now. So people buy
1:02:02
less Teslas maybe the Walmarts are more expensive than the trade war right now
1:02:06
with China. So that all gone. So there is a possibility. What he's
1:02:11
saying is look at the mathematics. This absolute amount did not increase sales
1:02:16
have actually gone down. So as a percentage this starts to look more
1:02:19
weighty. You see it's a percentage after all. That could be one of the case. We
1:02:24
don't know what else could be the reason. Brilliant.
1:02:32
No, we don't know. That's the point. Could be. You see? Could be. Yeah. What
1:02:36
else could be the reason? Maybe they sold like a factory or
1:02:39
something. They sold like a factory. Brilliant.
1:02:41
Superb. One time gain. Is that sustainable or nonsustainable?
1:02:45
Nonsustainable. Okay. But you see a 20 becoming a 30 becoming a 40. That means
1:02:49
that points that it could be luck. All right. Treasury
1:02:56
incomes. Look at those people who have invested into gold. Last one year 50%
1:03:00
growth. Humongous amount of growth. So today's you know that these days the
1:03:04
time where we file income tax return in India. So there was a return that I was
1:03:07
looking at the IT professional uh 5 million INR from IT sales or the typical
1:03:14
salary CPC and then double that from gold income because you see 2 years ago
1:03:19
he just bought some gold out of the parental inheritance and the gold has
1:03:22
now almost become like you know three times over the last 3 years. Such a
1:03:27
fluke such a guess such a lucky inheritance. Okay. All right. So can it
1:03:32
be also possibility? Do you know a company called as uni?
1:03:35
Uh which industry are they part of? Industry FMCG more or less.
1:03:42
All right, a fair point. Do they make textiles?
1:03:45
Yes. Are they famous for textiles?
1:03:51
No. Unable is not really into textiles. Imagine they start a business called as
1:03:55
textiles and that is very small. Will the colleague their primary job or
1:04:00
nonoperational initially to begin with over a period of
1:04:04
time textile does so well does so well and therefore textiles are growing now
1:04:08
what do you think this business should ideally do shift this nonoperating
1:04:11
income into the sales that also may be one of the reasons why this must be care
1:04:16
so I don't know we don't know okay that's what everybody welcome to the new
1:04:21
crime scene and this time we are changing it from income statement to
1:04:24
balance sheet Yeah, you're doing a fabulous job. And we are
1:04:32
just 10 minutes away. 10 minutes away from
1:04:37
the break. Um, what kind of firm does it look like?
1:04:42
Trading or manufacturing? People apply your logic.
1:04:48
What kind of firm does it look like? Which side by the way are you looking at
1:04:57
when you have to decide the nature of the business? Are you looking at the
1:05:00
funding side or are you looking at the asset side? Generally you look at the
1:05:04
asset side. The business model is always driven by what kind of resources do you
1:05:08
own? Funding is agnostic. So here you need to compare the proportion of amount
1:05:15
that you how much is the total amount that business have spent.
1:05:18
Pick up a number. Total size of the business.
1:05:22
size of the business. Which parameter do you pick up? Total assets. How much is
1:05:26
total assets? That means 250 is the amount of money that you spend. That's
1:05:30
your yellow box. Okay? And in yellow box, the spending is 20% and 80%.
1:05:35
Is it fair to say? Now, I'm going to make I'm going to make a statement. You
1:05:40
know, there is a company called as Toyota and there's a company called as
1:05:43
Renault, Nissan. Is it fair to say that this proportion of a Toyota is going to
1:05:50
be very similar to a Nissan and a Renault?
1:05:53
Yes. But maybe a little different than a
1:05:55
Tesla. Yes.
1:05:57
And completely non-comparable with Teta. Yes.
1:06:01
You see the point? This is the industry. This is the business model. So when Uber
1:06:05
and Ola launched themselves and said that you know we are disrupting the
1:06:09
business model. What do you mean by disrupting the business model? They're
1:06:12
changing this proportion. Disrupting the business model never means you're
1:06:16
looking at your funding side. Funding is basically where do you get the money to
1:06:20
invest. Now how do you invest is where the business model come into the
1:06:23
picture. All right. So you your vote is what? Trading or manufacturing?
1:06:27
Is it trading or manufacturing? Trading. Why? Because you see all of you
1:06:31
think that manufacturing needs more investment into long-term asset such as
1:06:37
machinery. Number one. Number two. Factory land. more particularly the
1:06:42
sheds that you create constructing a factory
1:06:45
laying down the conveyor belts having the goowns and so on so forth all of
1:06:49
those things are here maybe that is smaller here looks like
1:06:54
who knows that is maybe some other efficient factory some other disruptable
1:06:58
looks like you know is like a trading model
1:07:05
for you see now again point is are we always
1:07:09
sure about something No, but it is only guiding light.
1:07:14
1 is 2 + 2. What would you like it to be? Okay. Now, this is where you are
1:07:18
like guiding it. Okay. Um, yesterday, uh, it rained here, right? Yesterday
1:07:24
evening. Okay. Uh, is it monsoon? You see why can't it be monsoon?
1:07:33
It doesn't look like because you see that's the point. By one instance, you
1:07:37
cannot really conclude anything logically. You can only draw
1:07:40
probabilities around it. All right, everybody. Any concern from funding
1:07:44
point of view? The bank is higher than
1:07:48
so why is there a concern? Not enough.
1:07:52
That's a point. Now point is 150 is more than 100. So you have a problem. How low
1:07:56
should it be for you to say ah no it's okay.
1:07:59
Other maybe equal something like that. Okay. So you see again it depends on how
1:08:06
much loan is good enough for the fund. Okay. All right. Let me let me let me
1:08:10
take you to another crime scene and I have corrected your problem
1:08:14
everybody. I have corrected your funding problem. You said your bank loan was
1:08:19
higher so you were getting uncomfortable. I have reduced it.
1:08:22
I got the question but if the bank loans you money are cost to shareholders in
1:08:26
your business. No no no bank loan is just like the
1:08:28
borrowed capital. Simply borrowed capital you will return
1:08:32
them. All right everybody. Now what is the cause of concern?
1:08:36
This is the fourth crime scene you are at. Okay. What is the cause of concern?
1:08:43
Well, that's how the cement manufacturing is.
1:08:47
No, it is.
1:08:54
Because that's how the business model is.
1:09:00
Now the point is can you always change those proportion? Not always.
1:09:05
You pick up any university of the world. Any university as in any university.
1:09:11
Okay. Surange. Sometimes it is this way. Okay. Okay. Easy easy.
1:09:24
No. Allow me. Pick up. What I'm trying to say is you pick up a Howard, a
1:09:28
Watton, a Stanford, a Kilogs, an M, any university. Okay. This side is going to
1:09:34
look exactly the same in education as a business model. Okay.
1:09:41
This is going to be 99 and one. That's education. It is extremely risky.
1:09:49
Very high fixed cost. You can't change it. Okay. Sh. Okay. Remember that was
1:09:55
the last time I told you. So, uh we have to follow the norm. Um Rohit Um sorry
1:10:03
your good name. Zani make sure in Zani gets a minus five
1:10:08
in class participation. We promised last time was the last time.
1:10:12
And who else was there? Zani you were saying there were two more people you
1:10:16
hinted Surange. What happened to your friendship? What
1:10:23
just happened to your friendship gone out of the window? Gone.
1:10:27
You see you're not here to make friends. Classic example exhibit A. Just write
1:10:32
Suryange. And who else was talking suddenly? Why don't Why is Zani pointing
1:10:39
towards you? Zani, would you want to bring her to the
1:10:45
game? No.
1:10:49
Okay. All right. So, we stick to these two. Okay.
1:10:52
Okay. Yeah. Come back. What do I have better friends next time, George?
1:10:59
assets a long time. Okay, just make it - 5 minus 8 Rohit.
1:11:04
They're still not stopping. Yeah, George problem if the assets long.
1:11:11
99% will depreciate. 99 will depreciate unless it's a land which will
1:11:16
appreciate. But you see, you can't really benefit out of that appreciation.
1:11:20
Howard is still on the same land where it was which is bought. But but what
1:11:23
would you do with it? Would you sell it and shift your campus? No. So you see
1:11:26
that appreciation is of no use to you. That's exactly is the business and
1:11:30
that's exactly what the traditional way of doing business spend money which the
1:11:34
new age entrepreneurs don't like because that is depreciating. What's the point
1:11:37
of creating that you see ttor will never want to invest in like a fixed fixed
1:11:41
infrastructure because that's going to depre. So easy to come here, rent out.
1:11:44
Yesterday it was somebody else, today it is a better campus entity, tomorrow it
1:11:48
may be some other campus. That's the advantage of renting out. That's a new
1:11:51
age business models. And if you rent out things, these things will go down. And
1:11:56
that's what you will learn in your corporate finance. Different business
1:11:59
models. Where do you spend money? How do you spend money? In order to do that,
1:12:02
basic accounting will be required because then you will not have time to
1:12:06
explain what is a long-term asset versus what is a short-term asset. Okay? That's
1:12:09
why accounting is always part of your term one anywhere you go. That's the
1:12:13
language of the business. Okay everybody? So uh coming back any other
1:12:17
cause of concern? Now you are on the other side. Last time
1:12:23
you said the debt is low. Now you're saying the equity is too much.
1:12:28
Sure. Fair enough. Point well taken. Point well taken. There's always a
1:12:31
capital structure debate. Any other thing that you can pick up? Come on. You
1:12:35
can observe Sherlock Holmes fourth crime scene
1:12:41
by looking at these numbers. You're saying a short-term bank loan.
1:12:50
What about that? Very good. I don't know. Maybe because you don't
1:12:56
have that much. You started very strong but end day. No.
1:13:01
No. How do you know interest? It doesn't even know. You you for interest you need
1:13:06
to look at which statement profit and loss. This is a balance
1:13:09
sheet. You don't know the interest here. Well, maybe because a shortterm bank
1:13:13
always sucks because we have to pay back way faster.
1:13:17
So, so, so what is the problem? You pay in the short term.
1:13:23
Very good. Very good. This compared to this that mismatch is a problem. Is this
1:13:31
a profitability mismatch or a liquidity mismatch?
1:13:34
You see now imagine this is a 3 month bank loan. What will happen after 3
1:13:38
months from now? There will be a knock at the door and how much money do we
1:13:42
deserve to pay to the bank? 100. What will you do? You will see how much where
1:13:46
is my wallet? Where is all of that short-term assets? How much short-term
1:13:49
assets do you have? 25. How much will still be pending?
1:13:53
Now my question to all of you is where will you get the 75 from?
1:13:57
Number one. First option is sell long-term assets. Are you going to shut
1:14:04
down your business? No.
1:14:05
You see, so selling long-term asset is like the last resort.
1:14:09
Then second option you could have explored is raising equity.
1:14:14
People let me give you a practical version of equity. Whenever you raise
1:14:17
equity, you need 6 months minimum. It's very easy to say I'm going to go and
1:14:21
raise equity. Equity raising is hell of a job. It is regulatory. It is so much
1:14:25
negotiation, so many valuations this and that. Public equity and private equity
1:14:29
both need minimum 6 months of negotiation across the table from start
1:14:33
till the money enters your bank account even after investor says okay fine I
1:14:37
send you my commitment I'm committed to give you the money investors will take a
1:14:42
lot of time to get into money has to come in your bank account right there is
1:14:46
a loan that you have to pay so therefore that also is not a great idea but it's
1:14:50
still an option what else another loan very good you go to bank
1:14:56
two and say why do you need the money for? Oh, to pay somebody else. You think
1:15:00
the banker will be very happy about it. Oh, but what to do? Sometimes you do
1:15:04
that. Bank. Fantastic. The most obvious reason, the most
1:15:10
obvious solution is to go back to the same bank and say, I'm sorry, I did a
1:15:15
mistake and I'm not hiding here. I am committed an error. Now tell me what can
1:15:19
we do? The bank is also in the market to earn interest and you're also there in
1:15:23
the market to pay interest. So that is called as restructuring of loan.
1:15:29
Now tell me who's going to have the upper hand this time.
1:15:32
The bank. So imagine last time loan was at 8%, this time bank will say I will
1:15:35
charge 10. Last time loan was collateral free. This time bank will charge
1:15:39
collateral. Last time loan had limited covenants. Covenants means dos and
1:15:44
don'ts. This time bank will have a laundry list of covenants. How many
1:15:47
people had education loan? You see that 20pager document that you signed bank
1:15:51
can do this this and that. That's the power that you are giving to the bank by
1:15:55
signing. Yeah. Okay. Fine. I agree. I agree. I agree. So that thing can really
1:15:59
really change. Are we together on that? Okay.
1:16:03
Fifth crime scene. Welcome to cash flow statement this
1:16:07
time. Three questions.
1:16:16
Can you guess the age of the firm? Is it very old? Very new.
1:16:25
How do you know it's very new? Which number Surange? Which number tells
1:16:30
you pinpoint a number? One number that I agree. But can you let's say
1:16:39
now people you see how do you become better in in the game of chess or in the
1:16:44
strategy or in this analysis? By putting a counter logic. Okay. So that's my job
1:16:48
here as a devil's advocate. My question is if you can pick up just one number
1:16:53
out of these to answer the question is this firm young which number will that
1:16:59
be and why minus 100 why is that going to hint you
1:17:07
operationally the firm is unable to generate remember what is CFO how much
1:17:10
cash you are able to generate out of your day-to-day job that's just a 100
1:17:13
loss that's not a very powerful telling statement yeah Carlos
1:17:18
so that investing this one.
1:17:25
So you get 1.5 and you invest 1.1 that's a major investment.
1:17:30
Okay. Never do that.
1:17:34
Okay. Fair enough, George. 50.
1:17:38
50. Okay. How does that tell you that it's a startup?
1:17:41
Very very small amount. Okay. All right. That's not that's not
1:17:47
wrong either. Generally startups are not flushed with cash all the time. But
1:17:50
again my point is these are all conjectures. These are all some broad
1:17:54
templates in the mind. They may be wrong in in reality. Yes Sam CFF. Absolutely.
1:17:59
But you see Sam think about it. Can't an old firm raise a lot of money.
1:18:04
Can't Ramco after a lot of their years have just recently gone into an IPO like
1:18:09
recently as in 2014 and they like raising tons and tons and tons of money
1:18:14
like the largest ever this mother earth will see. So sometimes CFF being plus is
1:18:18
not just the full conclusive hint that it's a startup or not. You need to like
1:18:23
Suryanch was saying you need to look at actually all three of them in some kind
1:18:26
of a proportion. Okay. So I completely agree a large
1:18:31
funding with a lot of spending outside is going to be required for you to call
1:18:37
it like a startup startup. Okay. Coming to point number two. Where is the money
1:18:43
coming from and where is the money going? How would you quickly in one line
1:18:46
analyze coming from investors going into
1:18:49
brilliant answer superb answer very short very sweet coming from investors
1:18:55
how do you know this is debt or equity that's the point therefore if somebody
1:19:00
says my CFF is plus 1500 you can't assume key shareholders are these
1:19:05
shareholders or are these debt holders you can't really assume both of them are
1:19:08
clubbed under CFF and therefore the good word to use is investor not debt versus
1:19:13
equity okay all All right. Now the multi-million dollar question point
1:19:16
number three. If this continues next year, when do you
1:19:21
think company will have to raise the next round of funding? Everybody let me
1:19:24
give you a term called as cash runway. What is a cash run? What is a runway for
1:19:32
an for an airplane? It is the length of the road after which
1:19:38
the plane has to take off otherwise the it'll crash.
1:19:44
It is like the space that you have for yourself, the time that you're giving to
1:19:48
yourself to do something and after that if you don't do it crash will happen.
1:19:53
That's the cash runway. How many months, how many years?
1:19:58
How do you get three? Because so the investing money won't
1:20:02
change but every 100 will go in 100 CFO
1:20:07
H. So now the point is so then after you have so again
1:20:14
but are you telling the startup to stop to stop expanding
1:20:19
therefore therefore the point better is how much how much did you spend in last
1:20:23
full 12 months 1200 that means your run rate is 100 a
1:20:29
month 1200 in 12 months 100 a month including
1:20:33
machinery including salaries including marketing everything how How much cash
1:20:37
are you left with? 350. That means you are left for the
1:20:42
cash for how many months? Three and a half. Imagine this is
1:20:46
January 1st. January is covered, February covered, March covered and 15th
1:20:52
April is covered. Your firm is going to go bankrupt on 16th April. That's how in
1:20:57
an interview when Elon Musk said that you see thank God we were able to raise
1:21:01
funding on 24th of December otherwise on 26th my firm would have filed for
1:21:05
bankruptcy. How does how can somebody get to a date that's the date that you
1:21:10
come out with? So this is your three divided by 100 3.5 month is the cash
1:21:17
runway. So so I mean operating
1:21:22
investing both. Yeah. Okay. Have you heard about something called as cash
1:21:26
burn? You know how many how much is the burn rate? How much is this and that?
1:21:31
That's your burn rate. 1200 in 12 is equal to $100
1:21:36
a month. That's your burn rate. 100%. I take your point. But you see
1:21:45
startups are always in a particular fashion growing. But I take your point.
1:21:50
Okay. Again, it will depend on different startups. Everybody um and I'm I want to
1:21:54
just kind of look at this and tell me what kind of firm does it look like?
1:22:05
Is this startup or is this somebody else?
1:22:12
No people analysis is full 100% cognitive job. You can't do it with a
1:22:18
lighter mind. Think about it. Can this firm be a startup?
1:22:26
Can this firm be a startups? You're raising money but this time I
1:22:33
have changed the proportion of investing and operating. Can this firm be a
1:22:36
startup? Make up your mind. Everybody make up
1:22:42
your mind. You are Sherlock Holmes on the crime scene. Can this firm be a
1:22:46
start? The end goal of the business has
1:24:20
this business. Who is paying so much money?
1:24:30
Not from investors but Where is this?
1:24:46
So this is like I'm using the word and we will look at it in the next term
1:24:52
replacement capex. There are two capex. Expansionary capex versus replacement
1:24:58
capex. You already have a phone. you replace your phone, your capacity does
1:25:03
not go up. But you have one phone, you're buying one more phone. That's
1:25:07
where your capacity goes up. Expansionary capex versus replacement
1:25:11
capex. So when the size of the student at Tetar cohort one versus cohort 2
1:25:16
almost doubled, we had to make a lot of expansionary capex.
1:25:24
Expansionary capex means there were chairs in the room. Yeah.
1:25:43
Heat.

How can an external stakeholder decode maximum information from the disclosures made by the firm?
16/10/2025 | 08:30 AM - 10:00 AM
Mr. Ankur Kulshrestha
0:01
teams tomorrow 30
0:12
it's actually a project you know you can use strategy internet group everything
0:17
and I'll be there to help sure
0:19
seriously it's open book
0:21
open book open google open faculty Everybody make sure you're sitting with
1:16
somebody so that you can work in teams today. Today is going to be an absolute
1:22
dress rehearsal of what you have to do tomorrow.
1:36
Everybody joined in. Let's begin with the first question.
2:13
Last five questions. Let's begin. Read it carefully.
2:47
Everybody think about it. Think about it. Tetar as a small firm has a million
2:53
dollar debt and Nvidia as a firm has $50 billion debt. Who do you think will feel
3:00
the pain more? It is a Teta who will feel the pain
3:03
more. So in spite of the absolutely lower level, you need to look at the
3:07
overall context. Okay. Moving in. Moving in.
3:21
Which one is more relevant? Relevance is Well, um,
3:56
anybody explain why do you think a specific competitor is going to be more
4:00
relevant? competition
4:06
in an industry I mean we have all the competitors
4:09
which are not so related to each other for example for Tesla who is that one
4:13
competitor Tesla always wants to beat BY but let's say overall automotive
4:18
industry is not really the most relevant because in that overall automotive there
4:22
is a Honda who is not big on EV there is a Suzuki who is not big on EV but so
4:26
that specific competitor is going to be the most closely related to it
4:31
Sure. But you see there is one specific
4:38
competitor who's going to be very similar to your company in the DNA in
4:42
their you know blood and preferences and all of that. So relevance is higher
4:45
always when you're moving on a comparing yourself with a specific competitor.
4:50
Okay let's see let's get this right. Profitability
5:16
It's a perfect balance. Come on. I was hoping for a clear house and you have
5:23
like any. So, uh, what was the question everybody? Do you have to judge the
5:27
profit or profitability? That means relative which means the
5:33
margins are more important in context to revenue or in context to some other kind
5:37
rather than looking at the absolute profit.
5:41
Not per unit. You can look at in percentage terms also in terms of
5:44
revenue margins. It's not per unit.
5:47
Per unit is like you know how much Tesla makes uh $10,000 per car. That's not
5:52
what we're saying. We're saying Tesla makes 11% as margins. Okay.
6:31
Okay, good news. Maximum people feel it is everything put together. Uh that's
6:36
the right thing. See the capital employed means debt plus equity plus
6:39
everything together. So therefore you know the green boxes is okay. Let's see.
6:44
Uh oh really the last question read it carefully. Which margin will not change,
6:50
will not reduce. Well, that's the right answer. gross
7:13
margins because your gross margins have
7:17
implication only from the product costs. Your marketing, admin, selling, all
7:21
those expenses don't impact your gross margins and that's why it is and
7:25
anything that impacts your operating margin will also impact your net margin
7:28
because it'll have a trickle down effect. Okay, everybody. So, let's see
7:32
who stands where. Goofy. Who's the goofy? Okay. All right.
7:40
And then 2903. Well done. And then you have 29186.
7:46
Okay. Super. Excellent.
7:51
Let's begin everybody. So I want you to divide yourself in teams of two and set
7:56
sit separately from others. So these two are together. These two Brendan you want
8:00
to join her at the back. Come in front. Yeah.
8:08
name tags so that I would know how are you doing.
8:12
Teams of two join the site two are together.
8:17
Uh maybe yeah. And I hope every team has one laptop at
8:40
least. Cool. At least one laptop.
8:49
People it is a match practice of what you're going to do tomorrow. So in case
8:52
you want to get good grades in 30% weightage which is going to be the
8:56
exercise tomorrow, let's be very very serious and candid about what we're
9:00
doing. Commit mistakes as much as possible. Okay. Part
9:06
straight. Thank you. Okay. Um, in case you have
9:10
friends who could not attend the class, make sure they watch the video
9:15
recordings before coming tomorrow. Whatever you're going to do tomorrow is
9:18
what we are going to do here. Okay. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday which is
9:23
equal to a Friday. So today is what you're going to learn
9:26
the art of building the narrative, writing, committing mistakes and then
9:30
improving. That's how today's class is going to be. Please don't shy away from
9:35
giving the first draft. First draft, first output is always not good. It's
9:40
very difficult. But that's how the journey of a thousand mile begins with
9:44
the first single step. Okay everybody, I want to begin by giving you uh by giving
9:50
a quick uh question. So this is my feedback from Tuesday's Excel exercise.
9:56
Okay, you guys did a good job. But I found that there was some struggle in
10:00
relation to fishing. What is what do you mean by the word fishing? Too many
10:04
numbers out in the pond. You need to pick up the right one that you need. Now
10:08
what I mean is the following. For ratios, you need these things like
10:13
sometimes you need short-term assets, sometimes you need quick assets,
10:16
sometimes you need long-term assets, sometimes you need total assets. But the
10:19
businesses give you too much detail. My question to you is if this is what you
10:24
have tomorrow and you need a ratio which uses total assets, which one will you
10:30
include? You will be given these many details.
10:34
What you want is to pick up total assets. Which ones will you add up?
10:38
All of them. Brilliant. Okay, stay with me. If you need to pick up only the
10:42
long-term ones, which one will you add up?
10:47
Which one out of these eight will you add up?
10:50
only one and two because rest all of them are short-term.
10:55
That's what will answer the third point. If you have to pick up quick assets out
10:59
of those, which one will you add up? Other than all the short-term assets
11:07
other than inventory and prepaid. So, which means your
11:13
six, seven, and eight are your quick assets.
11:19
And then there is something called as cash assets. Cash assets are quick.
11:24
Quick assets. They are but within the short-term
11:28
assets they are even more short-term. Even more short-term. And then what are
11:32
the cash assets? Cash assets are really the bank and the short-term investments.
11:37
People ratios will always always need some kind of a fishing that you need to
11:42
do. So you see Tuesday we gave you a balance sheet and an income statement on
11:46
which you need to calculate the ratios. There was some botheration.
11:50
Profit and loss and income statements were done well but balance sheet was I
11:54
thought that you know you need it. So this is an important thing that you need
11:58
to know and I take you to even more interesting slide which is a slide on
12:04
the liability side. Just make yourself wiser by look reading
12:10
one to seven. These are the things that you see in the balance sheet.
12:19
If somebody asks you to pick up current liabilities, short-term liabilities,
12:23
which one will you pick up? What are the things that you will add?
12:29
Current liabilities. Current means short-term.
12:33
You will include a four, a five, a six. Rohit, can we get better markers? All
12:39
these have dried up. Four, five,
12:45
six. Is seven not a short-term liability? It
12:50
is. It is.
12:53
Advance from customers. Okay. If somebody asks you to pick up financing
12:57
this time, no short-term, long-term, but financing in nature, interestbearing in
13:01
nature. Which ones will you add up? Which one will you add up in debt?
13:05
Three and four. Three and four. Everybody you see that
13:09
the number four is getting repeated but that's all right. Number four has two
13:13
dimensions to it. One it's a loan. So whenever we had to add up loans you need
13:17
to include it. And second it is short-term. So whenever you have to
13:20
count shortterm you have to include it. You have to be very dispassionate about
13:23
it. Point number three total obligations.
13:27
Which one will you add up? 3 4 5 6 7.
13:32
Fantastic. Okay. Owner stake debt to equity needs a denominator equity.
13:39
What is equity? Is always the capital plus the reserves. This is the most
13:43
common error that happened on Tuesday. Whenever you have to calculate equity,
13:46
you picked up only point number one on Tuesday. You need to also include
13:50
reserves. So owner stake is 1 + 2 together. Obligations are 3 to7. And how
13:58
much is total capital employed? The blue box.
14:02
The whole blue box. The whole blue box here debt plus equity. So can I say
14:08
these two were debt these two is equity and therefore 1 to 4 is your total
14:17
capital employed. So if there is a ratio called as return on capital employed it
14:21
will have a denominator 1 plus 2 + 3 + 4.
14:24
Tomorrow you will have access to chat GBD and you can try it today. It's a
14:29
false positive in your life. It will give you so much information but in
14:33
order to process it you need your brain capacity only you have to forget. Okay.
14:37
So always always remember that your chat GBT will not help you all the time.
14:45
Tomorrow open Google open chat GBT everything is going to be given.
14:51
Yes. Go ahead. If you can refer chat GBD you can refer
14:59
to anything tomorrow. from from tomorrow
15:06
for finals. It'll be a closed book exam. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
15:12
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. You don't have to go to any book. Even
15:15
if you kind of go through the slides pretty well. You will be sorted. There
15:19
is no way you can't you know score full on full. So everybody I want to just
15:24
kind of get to the art of building narratives and I just want to you know
15:27
tell you that there are two components to it. One is the observation. The other
15:30
one is a communication. Communication is what how you kind of inform what you see
15:35
and observation is the things that you see. And I want to quickly look at the
15:42
video. Can we play the video? Rohit. And they should not see they should only
15:48
hear the video. So we can kind of switch the screen
15:53
while everybody we are going to play something
16:14
and you have to try and make as much sense of that as possible as a listener.
16:55
Yeah. No. No. But you have to
17:04
the sound system will not work, is it? Yeah.
17:29
Heat. Heat. Messi. This is his moment again.
18:05
Messi looks to make it clear. And make it clear he has. And Alvarez is on his
18:09
way. And he is not alone. And he keeps on powering.
18:19
some some kind of a goal would have happened. Okay.
18:26
Sensational. Did you say sensational goal?
18:34
You see the the emphasis that you know that the
18:39
commentator sorry what did I say the emphasis that who had put commentator
18:44
commentator is creating a commentary commentary is nothing but a narrative
18:48
narrative is exactly what you have to do so you have to actually write a solo
18:57
and now by Messi holding off guard Messi's pass Then there's Neil Messi
19:09
goal or was it not a goal? You see it was amazing
19:16
you without you looking at the match you're able to make some sense of what
19:20
is happening out there. That's the power and that's the role of narrative that
19:24
you have to build. Ivakovic down strongly.
19:30
Pair of South Americans in Brazil and Argentina.
19:35
They're facing Messi here. Messi held up by Guard. Messi away from
19:42
Guardol. All in the final
19:50
with the finish. of time in this goal.
19:58
So the the the thing was that uh because I could see it. So Messi had taken it
20:03
from the midfield till the goalkeepers and finally a assist and somebody else
20:09
kicked the goal. So the commentator put more emphasis on somebody who assisted
20:14
because that was really the hero of the show in this goal. Somebody who got the
20:18
assist and kind of just you know pulled it through. That really wasn't the most
20:22
important hard work. So where to put most emphasis on depends on the role of
20:26
the commentator and narrative builder. All right. So let's go back to our slide
20:32
and start building the narrative. And this is where everybody the teamwork is
20:35
going to begin. Numbers don't change. Absolutely.
20:53
Numbers don't change 100%. Okay. 60 seconds everybody. You have to
20:58
find the difference. Let's see how observant you are. Speak to the person
21:01
sitting next to you in case you wish. If you find three differences, you're a
21:09
genius. Extraordinary.
21:51
Last 10 seconds. 3 2
22:04
1 Okay, I did. How many differences?
22:09
Anybody any team found three differences?
22:13
Two. Two differences.
22:27
here. This one.
22:30
Okay. And there is a spiral here as well.
22:39
Anybody found two differences or one? Seriously,
22:46
it is exactly a copy paste of each other.
22:51
There are no differences. It's an important learning for narrative
22:55
building. We will not unnecessarily create something which is sensational to
22:59
draw attention. We are not journalists. We are good financial analysts. We are
23:04
entrepreneurs. We are building narratives of something. But this
23:08
definitely has some observation worthy trends. What do you observe? I want to
23:14
see your observation power. What do you observe? A company's sales data is
23:18
presented for 3 years along with the industry average. What do you observe?
23:24
What do you observe? Come on. Your observation is everything. Sherlock
23:27
Holmes every year.
23:31
They are doing better every year. Can I say you are saying the sales are
23:34
increasing? Okay. What else do you observe?
23:40
Sorry. Sales are lower than industry average.
23:45
Okay. Lower than industry. Fantastic. What else do you observe?
24:02
Which means the yearon-year change which is here 75%
24:06
1.5 / 2 here fell down to 7 0.3 divided by 3.5 that's what how are you going to
24:15
write it how are you going to write it in words a 75% increase has become a 7%
24:20
increase. How would you write it? M m you see this is the difficulty that
24:35
you have to smoon out today so that tomorrow you guys are not stuck. Okay.
24:39
What what do you say 75 becoming seven the
24:46
growth of sales declining growth of sales. Okay. Or
24:51
anything else in economics that sorry Victor once again.
25:01
Correct. Correct. So that that's already we have included here at point number
25:04
two. They're not the leaders. Okay. So here uh there is a word. Come on. In
25:08
economics you have done it. That's exactly the point. What do you
25:17
call it? Diminishing
25:21
return something like that. Okay. Falling returns flattening of slope. Uh
25:27
you know sales. Can I I'm going to use a word. Tell me whether you catch it.
25:31
Sales increasing but at a decreasing rate.
25:35
So sales are increasing. We're not saying in the third year sales have
25:38
fallen down. Sales are increasing but at a decreasing rate. So here sales
25:44
increasing at decreasing rate. One more point you would have called sales
25:51
increasing at decreasing rate even when this number would have been a 10 and
25:54
this would have been seven. Right? The growth would have been 10 initially and
25:58
then seven. You would have said the same thing. Here in this case it's not 10 to7
26:01
it is 75-7. So how would you bring this point? Again
26:06
it's the same point of commentary sensational goal versus sensational
26:10
goal. You see the emphasis has to come in. 75 is becoming a seven. How would
26:16
you change sales increasing at diminishing?
26:20
Diminishing is decreasing. That's the same thing. No, but you're
26:24
but you're writing. You're not speaking. What what what adjective will you use
26:28
here? use higher
26:32
highly decreasing cliff falling you have to use the correct adjectives to be able
26:37
to you know make right sense people think about it somebody who will wanting
26:42
to make sense of these numbers would not have access to the numbers but will
26:46
listen or read the commentary you write so the commentary that you write have to
26:50
be so measured that it should give exactly the same communication are we
26:54
together on that now everybody the task as a team begins now you as a team have
26:58
to give me 20 words without numbers which captures all three dimensions of
27:04
the whole thing. 20 words line narrative of the entire thing. If you meet
27:10
somebody in an elevator, this is your company and somebody asks you how's been
27:14
your sales, what 20 line 20word line would you say? You're not going to say
27:19
my sales in year 1 was so and so sales in year two. The guy's going to say come
27:23
on cut to chase. Tell me what's the sense. This is the narrative that 20word
27:27
narrative you have to build. Come on, discuss within your teams. Write it
27:30
down. And I want to hear that one. This one.
27:32
This one. That narrative should capture all the three dimensions which you just
27:37
observed. Observation is first and then binding it
27:42
into a narrative is next. It has to be 20 words. It cannot use
27:55
numbers. statement or something.
27:59
Yeah. Like an statement that you will speak to anybody who is
28:06
what are you going to use? You have to be very very correct. You can write it
28:10
in case you wish. No, no, no, no. I like 20 21 22ish
28:27
kind of thing. You have 20. You have 20 words. Do you
28:32
think you have enough time to describe also?
28:36
Come, I'll tell you what I sell. No. Nothing. Just say how much is your
28:43
sales? That's it. That's a question. So you got to just capture these three
28:46
trends in 20 words or lesser in case you can
28:56
part ready I'm going to come to you and start with you first
29:02
right or wrong doesn't matter today getting embarrassed not embarrassed
29:06
doesn't matter today ready
29:15
people write it down. You see, the more you write down, you'll realize how wrong
29:18
you were. The idea of these classes is to become
29:22
better. Sorry.
29:31
Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Tell me something. One more. One more
29:54
thing. One more thing. Everybody, somebody says we are missing the
29:57
industry mark. That's your observation, right?
29:59
Yes. Are we just missing the industry mark or
30:01
are we missing it marginally or are we missing it with a wide margin?
30:06
Marginally. So that should also come up, right? Imagine
30:10
you need to tell everything to the listener, everything to the reader.
30:15
Whatever you can observe except the numbers.
30:23
Come on, somebody take a shot. You don't have to be the perfect
30:26
year. You have only 20 20 words. Remember, you
30:39
have to write it down. People write it down. It's a false positive in your mind
30:43
that I can do it. I can do it. You have to show me today that you can do it.
30:46
Victor, go. Go ahead. One more time. Sales are
30:54
increasing at a decreasing rate. Now in this you missed out on a couple
31:07
of things. Number one, the fall from a 75 to a 7% is not coming out. Second, by
31:13
what margin are you missing the industry average that's not coming out? Add the
31:17
right objectives. Okay. Yes, part go ahead.
31:22
You can't choose the numbers. That's a That's a trick. That's a
31:27
challenge. Can't choose the numbers. No. No.
31:42
Everybody I will tell you when to use chat GBT. Don't worry we will use chat
31:47
GBT today and tomorrow. But in order to use chat GBT you must have your natural
31:51
intelligence in order to critique what that person will give you. You can't be
31:55
a slave of that software. You need to control that software. So you need to
31:59
have your NI. NI stands for natural intelligence to be able to use AI.
32:06
You can't be dependent overtly dependent. Yes. Go ahead.
32:12
industry by what margin?
32:16
Close margin. Wide margin. You see, somebody misses the flight by 1
32:22
minute. Somebody misses the flight by like an hour. The two will have
32:26
different emotions at that moment by a close margin. You see, now write it
32:30
down. Blend it together and then you'll figure out everybody. Writing down
32:34
narrative will give you a lot of clarity. Would you want to try?
32:39
Try it out. You might be wrong. That's it. What worse can happen? That's about
32:44
it. How do you know? You have not seen the
32:50
paper. You have not seen the paper. How can you say you'll fail?
32:52
Yes. Go ahead, sir. Sales are increasing on a diminish rate.
33:00
Uh how do you know? So, so, so you have actually added you
33:05
have done something which we'll do in term two which is a forecasting. And now
33:09
here we are not doing forecasting. So remove the forecasting bit and read
33:12
again. Sales are increasing. Stop. Now did the narrative capture that
33:19
a diminishing rate means a 75 to a seven?
33:23
That's the element that got missed out. So you would have said the same thing if
33:30
the rate of increase was like a 10% becoming a 8%. Then also your narrative
33:35
would fit in. Sales are increasing at a diminishing rate. But here it's not a 10
33:39
becoming nine. It is a 75 becoming a seven. It's a huge drop in the growth.
33:46
Sales still continue to rise. But the rate at which they were growing has slip
33:52
slipped. It has cliff fallen. Sales first
33:57
year and after that
34:02
but sales are not stagnating. Stagnating means flat. They're still growing.
34:07
But yeah, we that's that's the that's the challenge
34:12
in narrative building that you will face. The is there is one thing to feel
34:15
the emotion. Second is to express the emotion. You have to learn the art of
34:19
expressing. Yes sir. Slowing down
34:24
and stop but slowing down from where to
34:27
where? No. See the point is slowing down will be even when it slows down from 10%
34:31
to 8%. That's also slow down. But here it is 75 to 7.
34:41
You can't use numbers. Correct. That's it.
34:47
The sales are steadily. The sales are growing. Can we use the word steady? No.
34:51
Because it's not steady. It's very bumpy, right? Sales are increasing.
34:55
But the growth drastically fell down in the third year. You see, it has captured
35:02
two dimensions. Number one, the sales are growing. Second, it has cliff
35:04
fallen. However, it's still not capturing the industry average. So, add
35:08
to this line. Sales are increasing. However, the growth drastically fell.
35:24
Little bit took a steep dip. Took a deep div. Okay.
35:33
All right. That's it. Closing down to industry
35:39
average by a close margin. Yeah. Closing is also like a similar thing. I get your
35:44
point. I you see everybody no answer was perfect frankly but we are moving
35:49
towards the perfect answer. Okay. Let's see. Let's see if you can pick up the
35:52
next trend. Okay, next trend.
36:01
How will the narrative change for company one versus company two? Exactly
36:05
same performance. Therefore, how will the narrative of the
36:10
two change both are missing the industry average?
36:16
both are you know let's say below the industry average by big margin. So
36:22
sometimes you need to also amplify that you know by what amount you know on
36:27
which side are you at. So let's say you know um there are some competitive exams
36:32
and sometimes you fail by one mark versus you fail by like a 100 marks. So
36:37
you see the emotion is very different at that moment. Yeah. And you know your
36:41
family and all say you know he studied very hard but he could not crack it.
36:46
That's one way. Oh, he studied very hard and he missed it via whisker. You see
36:51
the two things will capture a very different emotions. All right. Okay. So,
36:55
you were able to pick it up. And now, how will the narrative be different for
37:00
one and three? Exactly same. Exactly same performance.
37:08
Think about it and then speak. Think about it. Think. Thinking is important.
37:14
Yes, ma'am. different companies. Yeah.
37:27
But one smalled
37:34
this is also a small margin. This is also a small margin.
37:37
Yeah. That's it.
37:41
That's it. So can I say that the narrative for number three is going to
37:44
be like a winner's narrative and number one's narrative like a losers narrative.
37:50
Think about it. Both of them have done exactly the same job. But we'll speak to
37:54
the third one as a winner and speak to the first one as a loser
37:59
because you are able to cross the industry average here and you're not
38:05
able to cross the industry average here. So I'll have to speak to both. Imagine
38:09
industry average is your cut off. So therefore in one you're able to clear
38:13
the cutff in the other you're not able to. That's the power of narrative that
38:17
you have to build in. People will not be able to people when you are interacting
38:20
let's say you go to Jitex. Okay. How was your experience yesterday people will be
38:25
talking were they showing numbers about themselves? Were they showing the
38:28
business income statement and balance sheets with them? Did they carry the
38:31
ratio sheet with them? No. But the moment you know they was having business
38:34
conversations there were some sentences and lines that they were making. Those
38:38
lines were based on things that you know that you're capturing here. So everybody
38:42
this is a task for today. It should take about 20 25 minutes not more than that.
38:47
Um do you recall these numbers? Let's see if somebody can recall these
38:51
numbers. You have seen these numbers. Where did you see them?
38:56
That's it. That's the case we worked on on Tuesday. Okay. We did calculation on
39:02
Tuesday. We never looked at the reading of those numbers. Today you have to
39:07
start reading the numbers. So what you what I'm doing is I'm dividing the whole
39:10
sheet into two parts actually four. Solvency, liquidity, activity,
39:14
profitability. Solvency, liquidity, activity, profitability. That's it.
39:21
On every slide, please download the slides. You have the slides given as
39:25
in-class material. And I want your observation to be written against XXX.
39:30
You have to actually punch what you see. people. Tomorrow is what you'll have to
39:35
actually do those things. So today is a time where you can do the match
39:39
practice. Commit as many no balls. Commit as many
39:44
you know wrong shots but tomorrow let it be a picture perfect thing.
39:49
So you should discuss what do you observe?
39:54
Write your observations minimum two to three
39:57
and then we will answer the question which is at the top.
40:02
Let's do it. Let's do it. Come on. You should sit with somebody in case you
40:08
feel like otherwise alone is okay. In-class material for session 12.
40:22
No, no. Session 12 is today, Thursday. People
40:38
after 5 minutes from now we will ask you to read your observations
40:44
and the narrative for solveny. You have five minutes.
40:53
How do you want?
41:58
Yeah, look at these two ratios. They're telling a story. Try and make the
42:02
observations. Write those observations in your slides.
42:07
Once you have the observations, for these observations into a keyword
42:11
narrative like we did and after you have written that narrative try and answer
42:16
the question the three things you do observations first narrative second and
42:21
answering the question people I will tell you when to use okay
42:28
but just stay with me for five minutes try and do it yourself
42:35
in case somebody wants to know what does debt to equity do you can always ask
42:39
Google and But pick up the pick up this
43:19
You can By the time
43:40
you should be comfortable in looking at a number and being able to create a
43:46
story behind it all
44:18
idea. Oh. and denominator formula and you can also go to charge in
44:24
case you want to know what does equity interpret what are they trying to find
44:29
out that's what
44:54
These are all in times. This is the first time you commit
45:11
mistakes and then you become better. Two
45:29
more minutes and then we go group by group. Figure out what they have
45:32
written. People you must be able to write the
45:38
narrative narrative based on what you see.
46:02
are very good. You have to learn the art of
46:23
This is something good.
47:01
One more minute and then we go to each team for their narrative.
47:10
your 10th or 12th attempt will be good. So the faster you get there, the faster
47:16
you get to the green And then
48:00
what margin is marginally Was it
48:18
station? No, that's what
49:13
I see. Okay, everybody. Let's see.
50:04
That's the whole idea. compared to
50:26
8.6 indicates
50:41
financial pressure capitaling
50:59
I would have given you time after hours. So
52:17
Okay, just think about these factors and say
52:29
everybody let's see what's Very good.
53:14
That comfort number one
53:24
both. Okay everybody let's see let's see what
53:29
have you got. So I want to three groups to figure out what is the observation
53:34
that you're making. Okay. Okay. And what about interest?
54:12
What's the operation of that? That's a point.
54:45
No, that's incorrect. This ratio is coming down which means
54:51
that this is going down or this is going up.
54:58
The ratio will come down, right? point. So what is now everybody? Um I
55:12
want you to click a picture. Some of you might have already done it. Try and feed
55:16
this picture to ask that fellow to generate a 20word
55:22
narrative without numbers for you. Let's see what comes up with.
55:28
You have to give a prompt without number in 20 words.
55:53
You can use anybody
56:18
situations. Very good. Can you say that loudly?
57:04
Now answer the question which is on clear heading. Is the capital structure
57:07
under pressure? Yes. So this is what your conversation
57:11
is going to be. Let's say in an elevator when you meet somebody how
57:17
you finding it and then you're going to say the company is
57:22
more over the last years and now you know it's finding it difficult to you
57:27
know cover the numbers that my interest ratio was 9.6.6
57:32
and no you don't have so the narratives are very summary form but captures
57:38
everything. Okay, everybody. Point number two. Let's see what are your
57:42
observations. Let's do it together. What are your observations?
57:46
Can you quickly go to captivity and find out the what does current ratio
57:51
interpret? What about business? Current ratio interpret.
58:03
See the difference? One is accounting, the other one's business.
58:06
That's what how comfortable the company can cover it shortterm obligation.
58:11
That's what current ratio interprets. Now what is your observation everybody?
58:16
A 2.5 becoming 1.6 good thing or bad thing?
58:20
Bad thing. Is it marginal fall? Is it a huge fall?
58:24
Huge fall from a 2.6 to 2.5 to 1.6 huge fall. And compared to industry
58:30
it's again a fall. There are two bad uses that you have to write in your
58:35
narative. Number one over a period of time your comfort has gone down and
58:39
second the industry is much better and your convers
58:43
is what is liquidity or quick ratio interpreting can you ask?
58:49
What is liquidity ratio interpreting the ratio
59:01
short-term ability of the firm to pay short obligations?
59:06
So basically current ratio measures if in case you have one year how
59:10
comfortably you can pay your obligations. Quick ratio measures in
59:14
case you have three months how quickly can you still measure? So in 3 months
59:17
it's difficult to sell inventory. So therefore you exclude inventory and
59:21
therefore take only the quick ratios the quick assets out here. Okay. Sort out
59:25
everybody. Now can you please click a picture and see what chat GBD throw as
59:30
the narrative. Give a prompt 20 words without using numbers.
59:36
Or maybe this time give a prompt 30 words. Let's see in 30 words what more
59:40
can we get? Who's going to start?
1:00:18
Click a picture and let's see what chat GBT throws up in 30 words. People, this
1:00:24
is exactly something that you have to do tomorrow. Yes. Go ahead.
1:00:38
That's it. Brilliant. Can you uh give a prompt again? Summarize in 20 words
1:00:45
because the second line appeared unnecessary superfluous. So we gave chat
1:00:49
GB too much too many words to use. shortterm.
1:00:59
So short-term you know ability to pay and the cash management is under
1:01:03
pressure. So what is the answer to the question? Does the firm have enough
1:01:10
adequate coverage for it short-term liability? Currently yes but it is
1:01:14
weakening. You see there are two difference there are two different
1:01:17
points. Today only I have become poor that's a separate things and I am
1:01:22
destroying my wealth but I'm still very rich right now. That's a different
1:01:25
thing. So here companies still have enough to pay. You see how would you
1:01:30
read 1.6 everybody? 1.6 per one for every $1 you have still $1.6 of current
1:01:36
assets. So you have still some coverage but that coverage is weakening that way.
1:01:40
Okay. So everybody this is how you kind of do for activity ratios and and
1:01:45
profitability ratios as well. So this is the exercise that I wanted to do with
1:01:49
you so that you are aware about how do you so there are three steps. Number
1:01:53
one, observations. Second, build a narrative. And third, answer the primary
1:01:59
question that is being asked. Tomorrow exactly, you have to do the same thing.
1:02:03
Observation, narrative, and then answer the question.
1:02:07
And with that, I am at the last phase for today. Rapid fire. Match the
1:02:13
following. Everybody, there is a question. You tell me which ratio will
1:02:16
answer. There is a question. You tell me which
1:02:20
ratio will answer. Question number one,
1:02:26
investors don't ask you how much is your quick ratio, how much is your return on
1:02:29
asset. They ask you questions. You tell me which ratio will answer that.
1:02:34
You see the question never had the word equity in it. But they're just basically
1:02:38
asking your ability to handle more debt, which automatically is going to come
1:02:42
from a relative ratio called as debt to equity. Question number two,
1:02:47
which ratio do you think will answer this?
1:02:55
Catch the key words. Interest coverage ratio. How do you know
1:02:59
this time it is interest coverage? The key word
1:03:06
you can continue meeting what? Periodic interest expense. So the focus this time
1:03:11
is on periodic interest expense not on the principal amount. Next.
1:03:17
Which ratio will answer this question? Read silently. Read silently.
1:03:28
How do you know? Brilliant. What was the key word?
1:03:35
That's all right. How do you know it was gross margin and not operating margin or
1:03:38
net margin? That's it. See, there it is. Next
1:03:45
question number four. Which ratio will answer?
1:03:51
Catch the key word. That's it. Brilliant. How do you know
1:03:59
it's operating and not net margin? Because the focus is on operating
1:04:04
expenses. Superb. Superb. Question number five.
1:04:30
How do you know this is net margin? Very good. And for shareholders, so what
1:04:39
value goes into shareholders pocket? It is a net profit that goes into
1:04:42
shareholders pocket. Okay. Next, which ratio is going to answer question
1:04:47
number six? That's it. Very good. Which ratio?
1:05:02
How efficiently you are deploying? Deploying what? Shareholders equity.
1:05:07
Which means this time revenue is not the benchmark. This time the equity is the
1:05:11
benchmark and therefore return on equity becomes the right ratio. Okay. Investors
1:05:16
asking you question number seven. Return on
1:05:28
brilliant. Superb return on assets. Fantastic. How well are these assets
1:05:33
generating value for the investors? Brilliant. So you're using the asset
1:05:36
which is the denominator and generating value which is the profit. Super. Um
1:05:42
question number eight
1:05:53
if all short-term obligations. How do you know it's quick ratio or how
1:06:00
do you know it is current ratio? What is the difference between quick
1:06:06
ratio and current ratio? Inventory. Inventory is not included.
1:06:12
Okay. While you're calculating the quick ratio, inventory is not included here.
1:06:16
Does is there any anywhere mention of inventory or anywhere mention of greater
1:06:21
urgency or need? No. So this is you know this is current ratio. Now read this
1:06:25
line. Now you see the investor is clearly
1:06:29
asking you excluding inventory what do you think the status is?
1:06:34
Correct. So that's your quick ratio. Question number 10.
1:06:59
Which ratio? Come on. How effectively is the fixed capital as well as working
1:07:03
capital which means the total capital uh employed to generate sales. Nobody's
1:07:08
asking about profits. Now turnover ratio
1:07:12
turnover ratios. Very good. Turnover ratios are ratios which are trying to
1:07:15
connect the assets with the sales. Higher turnover does not mean higher
1:07:20
profitability. It only means that you're able to generate more sales. Now sales
1:07:24
could might as well be lossmaking. So that's not the question here whether you
1:07:27
are profit or losses. You're only asking about to generate sales. So therefore
1:07:31
turnovers. Very good. What is DSO? That was a
1:07:45
question. No, no. Day sales outstanding. Uh it's
1:07:51
basically the collection period. How many days after the sale does your
1:07:57
customer pay you? So here you have the DPO days payable outstanding sales
1:08:04
outstanding and all that stuff. So everybody this is a brilliant brilliant
1:08:08
thing. Uh do you also have this a PDF four pager given to you as in-class
1:08:15
material? Nvidia Nvidia can you please correct correct
1:08:18
absolutely can you please go to your in-class material download the four
1:08:21
pager PDF my question to you is who is writing it
1:08:27
and who is the audience you have 60 seconds 60 seconds 60
1:08:33
seconds in class session 12 for today there must
1:08:39
be a PDF Who's writing it?
1:08:56
Very good. So he is that in individual capacity writing a letter to the
1:09:01
shareholder. And what do you think he's he's covering?
1:09:06
Don't read but just scan. What are what are the headings in that?
1:09:11
you know some key happenings within the last one year everybody Nvidia is a
1:09:16
public corporation all public corporations have to report annually a
1:09:22
lot of data not only the financial statements but also a lot of data about
1:09:27
businesses that report is called as an annual report tomorrow you'll have to
1:09:31
actually work and you know download the annual report of the company that will
1:09:35
be given to you from the annual report the initial few words these are called
1:09:39
as chairman's message, MD's message, some kind of you know director's message
1:09:44
and so on promoter's message that captures the key things that has
1:09:50
happened with the firm for the last 12 months. I want you to feed this to chat
1:09:54
GPT and identify three key themes. What are the key themes that you have? Can
1:10:02
you quickly do that? If your chat GBT subscription is not pro, you can use
1:10:07
Gemini or Gro whatever. Please feed this PDF to a GNAI and ask
1:10:13
them to call out key three themes. Earlier this was done by human beings.
1:10:19
Now the processing is outsourced to what are the three themes about the four
1:10:25
pager which is coming out. three things and please ask them to
1:10:33
summarize in 15 words. I mean individually they can't give you like a
1:10:38
thousandword summary of of 5,000 words. What's the point?
1:10:44
So your prompt has to be intelligently written.
1:11:03
Three key themes that come out of Nvidia's one year of operation.
1:11:11
People make sure that tomorrow all your Geminis and AIS and Grokes are working
1:11:16
well. Okay, that's one theme. Second,
1:11:38
okay, so everybody this is how you kind of decide and read the sense of it,
1:11:43
sense of the management narrative. Uh tomorrow again in the poster you'll have
1:11:47
to for the company given to you, you'll have to figure out what those key things
1:11:51
are from the chairperson's message. these this is how you kind of make sense
1:11:56
of what large companies are doing. So I just
1:12:00
want to end the course with a very very big thank you. It's not easy to kind of
1:12:05
start without knowing what an asset or a liability or an income or an expense
1:12:09
were and end at a note where we are using an AI tool to kind of decode the
1:12:13
management's message. A lot of water has flown down the bridge. Um but I want to
1:12:19
kind of also introduce to you what you will see in the next term the India term
1:12:23
a course called as business planning and forecasting which is an extension of
1:12:26
this. I'll tell you why I call it an extension. So this is a good starting
1:12:31
point for a course. Can you read the question?
1:12:39
I I meant read silently. Everybody of you will have to go through
1:12:48
this phase in case you are serious about your ventures. If you are casual then we
1:12:52
are not interested. As simple as that. But in case you are serious, you will
1:12:56
find thousand emails like these wanting to know more about you. And you know
1:13:01
what kind of questions that investors ask?
1:13:08
These kind of questions in particular. Can you read one?
1:13:17
What is CM1? Oh, then we will realize this is nothing but your gross profit.
1:13:24
Can you read point number two? Which ratio will give you the answer to
1:13:32
question number two? Which ratio will give you the answer to
1:13:36
question number two? Operating margin. Is investor happy to
1:13:40
just to say, "Oh yeah, yeah. What is my operating margin?" No. They say in case
1:13:44
you're profitable for last how many years when did you become profitable?
1:13:47
What are your margins right now? Every threadbear thing people asking for money
1:13:51
from somebody is like their hard work you are trying to put into your venture.
1:13:56
It is a big deal. So people who give you money will actually take the sunshine
1:14:00
out of you by asking you so many you know details because you don't have a
1:14:04
brand right now. Once you become Elon Musk you just put a finger to a number
1:14:09
people will throw money at you. But right now you have to explain a lot of
1:14:13
things. That's where accounting comes into the picture. Uh can you read point
1:14:16
number nine? Have you started observing the benefits
1:14:22
of sale and has your output more than since your output has more than tripled
1:14:27
in last three years? So on so forth. Now how do you measure the benefit of scale?
1:14:30
Economics you have the fundamental you have understood that you know cost goes
1:14:34
down and profits go up and all but how do you actually measure it to
1:14:37
communicate? There is something called as break even analysis. Okay. Now all
1:14:41
those things will come into play. So that's your next course which will build
1:14:46
on your understanding of FA. So that's where we kind of end and thank you very
1:14:50
much for you know being part of this course. We'll see you tomorrow. Let the
1:14:56
best team win. Uh bring all your tools, all your gadgets, be prepared. Make sure
1:15:01
that you have a good night's sleep so that that 60inut under pressure you are
1:15:06
not conking off. Okay. Time will always be an enemy. Always be an enemy. I'll
1:15:12
see you tomorrow. Thank you.
