Setting the Scene today’s: “Changing World Order”?
03/11/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Mr. Garrick Hileman
0:14
Uh anybody Should
0:33
we get started? Do you want to
0:36
Do you want me to kick things off? Yeah, sure.
0:38
Okay. Is someone grabbing water by any chance?
0:41
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great.
0:50
O. Okay. Can everyone hear me? Okay. It's
0:57
very It's a very hard surface room, so there may be some echoes and feedback.
1:02
Well, thank you for coming. I feel a little overdressed. Maybe I'll be a bit
1:06
more casual tomorrow. It's very warm to be wearing a black suit, uh, this time
1:11
of year in Dubai, but uh, it's very nice to be back in Dubai. I'm your lecturer
1:15
for this course on the shifting world order and the future of money. My name
1:19
is Garrick Hileman and we'll be spending the next five sessions together.
1:25
Um trying to understand the future of the world. Just a small
1:30
question, small question. What is the future of the world? What is the future
1:34
of money? Don't know if we'll have all the answers after our five sessions, but
1:38
hopefully together we'll have some ideas, some frameworks, a better
1:43
understanding about how to interpret the huge changes that are taking place right
1:47
now. Uh Ray Dalio, uh legendary investor,
1:53
founder of Bridgewater, wrote a a nice book, uh called The
1:57
Shifting World Order. He's put out some very nice videos. He's got a much bigger
2:02
budget than humble academics like myself have to make these videos very fancy and
2:06
impressive. So, um but uh he's I think done a nice job. Sorry, we're getting
2:12
quite a bit of feedback here. uh done a nice job of I think lining up
2:18
why we are living in historic times, why the next few years, the next decade
2:23
could be one of the most important in the last hundred years where major
2:28
changes take place that often take place only once a century once every several
2:34
centuries. So today's session we're going to if the
2:39
clerk will work here stop working. Uh oh.
2:47
There we go. Nope. There we go. So today's session we're
2:53
going to provide of course an introduc introduction to the course itself.
2:58
You're going to learn a little bit about me, including the fact that I'm an
3:01
economist, but I'm also a historian. And I know these topics macroeconomics
3:07
are relatively new for many of you. So, we're going to do some foundation
3:10
building to give you some basic tools, some macroeconomic tools to help you
3:14
think about the shifting world order. And we're going to go right into my
3:20
favorite subject, what is money? Uh, does anyone here care about money?
3:26
Anyone? Yeah, people like money. Yeah. It's amazing how little time in many
3:35
schools professors will spend teaching people about where money comes from, who
3:42
manufactures it, uh what is money? These are hugely important questions of all
3:49
the things in our world next to I mean money maybe the internet is the only
3:56
other thing that's as widely used. I mean, water, of course, you know, but
3:59
I'm talking about man-made, human-made creations. Money is something that very
4:06
few people, it turns out, actually understand.
4:10
And yet, most of the world uses every day, right? It's a real
4:16
travesty. We'll talk about why that's the case, why so few people understand
4:20
money, and hopefully today you'll leave with a better understanding of what is
4:25
money. If we have time, I'd like us to to get into small groups and do a little
4:29
exercise. And there is going to be one class participation question uh which uh
4:36
we'll we'll do here shortly. We'll get that out of the way soon. But um first
4:41
let's just uh say a little bit about me. So
4:48
my work uh has kind of straddled both the academic world and the business
4:54
world. So I would say that's one thing when you get a a class taught by me. You
5:00
get not just an academic professor, you get someone who's worked for decades in
5:04
venture capital and investment banking. I've started companies, raised money,
5:09
raised money here in Dubai even for tech startups. And so I bring both an
5:13
academic and a practitioner perspective to uh my my teaching. But the work that
5:19
I'm best known for in the academic world is work I did at the University of
5:24
Cambridge a few years back on cryptocurrency.
5:27
So for over a decade I both studied, researched, taught and worked in the
5:33
blockchain and cryptocurrency industry and did foundational work like this
5:37
cryptocurrency benchmarking study which is still I'm happy to say uh we
5:41
published this in 2017 still one of the most widely cited and highly referenced
5:47
uh research reports on cryptocurrency uh ever. But a bit more about myself. Um,
5:55
so I like I mentioned I'm an economist but
5:58
also a historian. I did my PhD at the Lemon School of Economics under the uh
6:04
supervision of Neil Ferguson. Sir Neil um Anybody know who Neil Ferguson is?
6:10
Any Neil Ferguson fans out there? No. Um he was recently kned by King Charles.
6:16
Sorry, Sir Knight. I I forget the exact OBBE
6:20
all of that but we call him Sir Neil now. He's up the road from me in
6:23
California at Stanford these days but back in 2010 he was my PhD supervisor at
6:27
the London School of Economics where I did my PhD in economic history. Um from
6:33
there I went to Cambridge. Uh I developed the force first class on
6:38
blockchain technology that was taught in the UK. I became ranked one of the most
6:43
uh one of the hundred most influential economists in the UK and Ireland. Um but
6:49
I also have as I mentioned 25 years of experience in the business world. Uh I
6:54
got my start doing investment banking in San Francisco. I co-founded a tech
6:58
incubator with one of Bill Gates's best friends and uh and then I've also
7:03
started uh crypto companies that have raised millions of dollars in capital. I
7:08
worked as the head of research at blockchain.com for four years. Uh head
7:12
of research at Coindesk before that. So, you know, I'm a bit of a tweener. I
7:16
straddle academia and the business world. And I've taught not just at
7:20
Cambridge and the LSC, but the University of Chicago, Oxford,
7:23
Northwestern, Columbia, and so on and so forth. And it's very it's very wonderful
7:28
to be here with you today. Any questions about my background?
7:35
Any Yes, please. I love questions by the way. So yes.
7:39
So right now that you're a teacher after having all this experience like do you
7:43
feel more accomplished by this or like what you
7:47
do I feel more accomplished? Yeah. Like mentoring and giving classes
7:51
about what you learn or like about the actual things.
7:55
I I love this. So I have a passion for education. I I enjoy meeting young
8:01
people who are looking to learn. I I was in your shoes, you know. Um, not your
8:07
exact shoes, but but I, you know, I got an email last week from a student, I
8:13
think in Scandinavia somewhere, who was doing doctoral research and asked for a
8:18
data set that I had put together on currency black markets. And it was
8:23
really exciting to be able to hand my entire data set to the student because I
8:28
used to be that student. I used to be that student who had to contact, you
8:32
know, kind of established professors. Um, I I had to chase down Neil Ferguson.
8:36
Like I I had to become the world's leading expert on Neil Ferguson to get
8:40
Neil Ferguson to give me five minute five minutes of his time to agree to be
8:45
my PhD supervisor. So I used to be like you trying to figure out my way, you
8:50
know, around all these very important people who were on TV. And it's nice to
8:56
be in the position to be able to give back and teach and and share what I've
9:00
learned. So that's what I do. That's why I do this. Yes.
9:04
How do you think affect do we have still have to give it some
9:15
time or do you think it will never have money or what do you think about AI?
9:20
I'm so glad you asked the question about AI. So Ray Dalio's book came out a few
9:25
years ago right as large language models and companies like OpenAI were starting
9:30
to take off. And I think there's a gap in some of the thinking around the
9:37
shifting world order and what's happening with artificial intelligence
9:42
and also blockchain technology was which was a bit of a blind spot for Ray as
9:45
well. So as amazing as Ray's book is in his framework and look I'm not going to
9:51
question Ray Dalio the guy is a legend right but I think there are some gaps
9:55
including AI in in how we approached it which we're going to talk about in this
10:00
in this class. So, a lot of my recent work over the last year or two in terms
10:04
of teaching has been more focused on artificial intelligence,
10:09
the ethics, you know, safe AI, those kinds of questions. So, I'm glad you
10:13
brought that up. We'll definitely be covering that, you know, over the next
10:16
few sessions towards the end, but we'll be thinking about it along the way.
10:21
Great. Okay. So, enough about me. I want to
10:27
hear more about you. So I understand this is a very international group over
10:32
50 different nationalities from all over the world uh Asia, Middle East, Latin
10:39
America, Europe. Um who here is from India.
10:47
Okay. Pretty large large percentage. Yes. Who is from Latin America?
10:53
All right. Yes. That's a part of the world I want to visit more. I've only
10:57
gotten down to Peru and not enough places. Uh, who is from Europe?
11:04
Cool. Quite a bit. I've spent over 10 years of my life in Europe. If you call
11:09
the UK Europe, I, you know, it's debatable, right, these days. But I also
11:13
lived in Switzerland for a couple years. Love, love Europe. Got family in Europe.
11:18
Um, I'm a I'm a real European at heart. Anyone from America? Just out of
11:23
curiosity. Yeah. All right. What part? Colorado.
11:26
Colorado. Awesome. California. So, I grew up in Seattle, but yes. And then
11:30
someone else in the back. Virginia.
11:33
Virginia. Outstanding. All right. Yes. Canada, but
11:38
cool. Well, the 51st state, Canada, right? Trump wants to acquire Canada.
11:42
So, um, Middle East, who who's from this
11:47
region here? Only one person. Okay. What part of the the Middle East?
11:53
Nice. Okay. Hope to get there someday. I've never I've been this is my sixth
11:58
time to Dubai, but I've not made it to Saudi Arabia yet.
12:02
Um, cool. And then who who have I not called upon who wants to tell me where
12:08
they're from? Yes, Africa, of course. Yeah,
12:11
nice. I forgot to ask about Africa. Love Africa. Sagal, you said?
12:15
Yes. Okay, cool. I've been to Uganda,
12:18
Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa, but not Sagal. So, cool. Any anybody else want
12:25
to mention? Yes. Indonesia.
12:27
Indonesia. Great. What other parts of Asia are represented
12:31
here? Any Vietnam. Nice. Very cool. Um, wonderful. Well, you bring an important
12:37
perspective to this class. I did my masters, my MBA. I mentioned I lived in
12:41
Switzerland for two years. I did it at IMD and it was like a miniature United
12:45
Nations. We had, I think, 80 students and like you 50 different nationalities.
12:50
And that global perspective was really really helpful for tackling kind of big
12:55
questions about the future direction of the world and global economic growth. So
13:00
um that's great to hear. The next thing I want to cover is not just we didn't I
13:06
want to get to know you of course better over the next five sessions but right up
13:11
here up front it's really important that you tell me more about what it is you
13:16
want to get out of this class. So, I already heard some questions about
13:19
artificial intelligence. Who here is thinking about artificial intelligence
13:23
and how it's going to impact their career, what they should do for work?
13:28
You know, should we all become plumbers? Yes,
13:33
you're thinking about it. Technicians are needed. We're actually
13:36
building a business around this. So, it's needed.
13:39
Yeah. Like scarcity, demand is going to be high. Look, I'll tell you, I I think
13:44
it's not too late to rethink and go into plumbing or electrician's electrical
13:49
work. I I feel like I maybe made a big mistake. You know, I don't know. These
13:53
knowledge worker types like me are going to get obsoleted, I think, maybe pretty
13:58
quickly. But AI is a big question. It's fair to say, for many people, and and
14:03
how to navigate um your career. Does anyone have any thoughts on that? I'm
14:07
just curious. Who has the perfect bulletproof career strategy
14:14
to defeat the AI onslaught that's coming for all our jobs? Yes, sir.
14:29
when you build your skill set that nobody can take away from you and you're
14:32
like there's no way you get a company somewhere else if you have the skill
14:37
set. Yeah.
14:43
So entrepreneurship in general is a great career strategy to mitigate the AI
14:50
yeah threat to your career. You have more control potentially. Yes.
14:57
AI can easily. Yep. So molecules focusing on the
15:07
Yeah. Yes.
15:10
around that value of that will increase
15:18
future value of such companies or such really skyrocket because they're dealing
15:24
with yes
15:27
this this was a big joke in Silicon Valley for a long time where Peter Teal
15:32
very famous venture capitalist founder of Palunteer PayPal etc he joked
15:37
You know, we were promised flying cars, but we were only given, this is back
15:41
when Twitter had a limit on characters, 160 characters or apps. Basically, like
15:47
we focus too much on it, you know, coding, not enough on molecules, on real
15:52
things. Of course, Elon Musk has been doing something about that these past
15:56
few years, and he says we might get a flying car this year. Did you see that?
16:01
We're gonna Yeah. Yeah. Yes, sir. What How are you going to defeat AIS coming
16:04
for your career? All right. I think very
16:08
actually use it properly. So utilizing instead of
16:14
working a job with AI specializing
16:20
to have very many companies. Another thing is just building something
16:26
around. You know lots of people are just escaping and doubting themselves but
16:33
really you can either use it against yourself or you can actually utilize
16:38
maximize your and study your services, study yourself,
16:44
take your job as a boss. Instead of letting AI do it, become a
16:49
boss that uses AI. Yeah.
17:01
Good. Is anyone in here not using AI? Yeah, you're
17:08
question because for example is growing so much but also
17:12
all of the resources that is taken from like or
17:16
so if I take more of like a sustainable point of view and make a solution for
17:20
that I will be working by AI if not I can use enhanc
17:25
okay I am really bad with technology so
17:28
so I'm really trying to like get better and not fall behind
17:34
yeah the people who are less techsavvy or bad with technology I think often
17:39
have something of an advantage though because um you know people who are more
17:44
techsavvy or comfortable with technology I think we can sometimes be tricked or
17:50
fall in love with the technology and you may be asking more questions well I mean
17:54
yeah literally some people are falling in love with their chats right their
17:57
chat bots but that's not what I mean I mean more that we can be we can we can
18:03
we can I think become too enamored with the potential of technology rather than
18:09
pushing back on its limitations. So, you know, I've I've lived I lived
18:14
and worked in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is home to some of the smartest
18:18
people in the world, right? Very very high IQ, very very high intelligence,
18:22
very engineering focused, problem solving focused, right? You know, oh,
18:28
you've got a problem, let me fix it. That's the Silicon Valley attitude.
18:31
That's a Silicon Valley way. Oh, we want to build a flying car. Let's build it.
18:36
We want to create artificial intelligence. Let's do that. Right? But
18:41
there's a difference between intelligence,
18:43
which Silicon Valley is very good at, and wisdom. Should we build that thing?
18:49
Should I be spending my time on this? Is that what is really valuable? Right?
18:53
Intelligence and wisdom not always come together in the same person. Right?
19:00
Um, I I I just wanted to mention one other
19:04
thing about AI before we maybe try to move on a bit, which is I know in
19:08
academia it can be a bit of a um controversial thing. Some professors
19:15
don't want their students using AI. I I would I would love for you to use AI as
19:20
much as possible in this class just in general. I think that's a hugely
19:25
important thing. Um and so don't feel bad or shy about leveraging AI for any
19:30
of the things that we have uh to cover this this course. Um any other thoughts
19:36
on AI career before we any other any other
19:41
things you want to get out of this class? Yes.
19:45
So I think we are going to talk about money, right?
19:49
Yes. So most of us here we are entrepreneurs.
19:53
So we would love to practical insights about money, the money of the future and
19:58
everything. Perfect. We're we're going to hit that
20:03
today this session. So, yes. Yes. Hi.
20:11
Yes. Yes.
20:23
Yes. Yeah. We're gonna we're going to cover Dalio and other complimentary and
20:29
even competing frameworks for evaluating instability and societal shifts. Yes,
20:34
absolutely. Now, we don't have that much time, so
20:39
we're going to be covering some of these things at a you know, we'll try to get
20:42
to the the essence of the argument, but we're going to be limited a bit on how
20:47
deep we can go into any given topic. Um are people how many people here just
20:54
before we move on how many people here are
20:58
pessimistic about the future optimistic? Give me who's pessimistic
21:03
here? Anyone worried about the future? Few people who's feeling super bullish
21:10
and optimistic AI AI is going to come and take care of
21:15
all of us and more more optimism. Who's not sure? who's kind of maybe has mixed
21:20
feelings. Okay.
21:23
In some aspects is going to be really good and some we're going to be like oh
21:27
my god we need regulations for that because there is even like a president
21:31
that is being AI generated. So if we don't have actual control of AI you put
21:36
it as a what is going to happen? Yeah.
21:39
Well well the good news is right now the AI kind of sits in the middle right it
21:44
still needs a human to prompt it. All right. And it still needs a human to
21:48
evaluate it, right? In terms of large language models, we are not obsolete
21:53
yet. It's the middle part that it's covering right now, but not the
21:57
question, the prompt or the, you know, evaluation of the end. So
22:04
there's still purpose for us. And oh, by the way, one, no one mentioned my
22:07
favorite answer to what's the best career strategy to to um stay ahead of
22:13
AI. So all these AI companies, OpenAI, Anthropic, when they go out to sell
22:20
AI products to the enterprise, to institutions, to anyone, who do they
22:26
send? You, us people. They don't send AI to
22:34
sell AI. They send a human. So sales might be one of those careers
22:40
that can hang around a bit longer, too. Okay,
22:46
so let's talk about the course. Um, so we're going to talk about global
22:52
power dynamics and it's again a broad overview. We're going to try to get to
22:57
the essence of some of the key arguments of people like, you know, Ray Dalio,
23:01
Graham Ellison, my PhD supervisor Neil Ferguson. Um, someone who I'm very much
23:07
looking forward to introducing you to. I'm just kind of curious if anyone has
23:10
anyone read the work of Peter Turchin or is familiar with Cleoynamics?
23:16
Yes. Wow. How did you learn about Peter and Cleoynamics?
23:38
He Yeah, he's not as well known as as some of the other names we've mentioned
23:42
or people like Ken Rogoff. I've had the privilege of um being on a panel and
23:47
arguing with Ken Rogoff at uh investment bank conferences. Ken was one of the
23:51
reasons I went and got a PhD. It's always very exciting when you can meet
23:55
your heroes and and and do that. But Peter's kind of a you know a level of
24:00
fame below. But he's helped um introduce a new field called cleodnamics which
24:06
takes huge historical data sets over long periods of time and uses those to
24:14
actually forecast societal instability. So global shifts. And one of the things
24:21
Peter did which was pretty remarkable is all the way back in 2012 13 years ago he
24:27
looked at his model and said you know I'm looking at the trend lines and the
24:33
data and my model suggests that in the United States eight years in the future
24:38
around the year 2020 there will be a significant
24:43
destabilizing moment. um which I don't know how people feel
24:48
about the January 6th, you know, kind of, you know, congressional,
24:53
you know, u mob action, but uh that looked like a pretty good prediction
24:58
eight years in advance, which is pretty amazing. So, looking forward to
25:01
introducing to some people you may not know like Peter Turchin as well. Um we
25:07
want to try to bring into this classroom what's happening in the real world
25:12
today. This is not, you know, just about theory and models, although we're going
25:17
to spend time on that. Of course, we want to talk about real events, how they
25:22
conflict or support some of the arguments, evidence, theories you're
25:26
going to hear about in this classroom. Um, economics is going to be a part of
25:32
this. So, we're going to spend some time on some of the basics of economics. And
25:36
of course, no prerequisites for this, but it's it's a lot to take in. like
25:40
I've covered some of this material at the mast's level, you know, with
25:44
executive education courses. It can feel a bit overwhelming. Um, and there may be
25:49
some jargon. There may be some new terms that you're not familiar with. And I
25:54
want you to know that that's okay. In fact, you're in good company. Now,
26:00
hopefully the audio is going to work. If I play a video, it will. Okay.
26:06
Yeah. If some of the terminology doesn't make sense to you, just think of this
26:10
video and remember you're in good company.
26:13
Did you hear about the Fed? No. What
26:15
can we do to go to
26:24
Oh, okay.
26:29
Go back to here. I turned off presenter mode.
26:40
slideshow. Mhm.
26:51
I see. Okay.
26:56
Let me go here. So then I end show
27:05
Let's see. It's not. Yeah. Yeah, please. Sorry. We're just
27:18
trying to That's printing. Yeah.
27:38
That's notifications. Let me try unplugging maybe back in.
27:45
Let's try that. Are there any IT experts here in the audience?
27:51
We're just trying to play a YouTube video here. Let's see if this does it.
28:04
What are we going to do? Do you get like a drop down with all the
28:15
options like Wi-Fi, the airplane mode? I mean, in here it's got this is this is
28:47
Is there an Apple TV here? Okay, we may not be able to make this
28:52
work, unfortunately. Is there someone you can call for help?
28:57
We'll come back to the video here later. Um,
29:03
okay. Okay.
29:10
So, some of the specific subjects we're going to cover here include a brief
29:15
history of economic growth. We'll cover that today. talk about financial crisis,
29:20
talk about regulation, and as we mentioned, artificial intelligence and
29:24
the future of currency and money. One thing we're not going to be doing is
29:29
doing what um economics professors in years past have done, which is drill a
29:35
lot of equations into you that have very little predictive value or usefulness in
29:40
the real world. Uh this is Paul Samuelson. If you wanted to be a central
29:45
banker, uh, governor of a central bank, you needed to study under him. And
29:50
people like Stanley Fischer at MIT. Literally almost all the major central
29:53
bank governors, Ben Bernani, Mario Draghi, um, Mvin King, etc., all went to
29:59
MIT, all studied under Paul and Stan, and they had lots of equations drilled
30:05
into their heads that actually don't do a lot of good in the real world. So,
30:09
we're going to be not doing that. Um, we're going to talk about history. We're
30:14
going to talk about things that actually are happening. Empirical data. So, my
30:17
research is very empirically focused. What does the data out there say? You
30:21
know, what what is real evidence from the real world tell us about what's
30:26
happening? Um, and hopefully with all this, bring it back to your
30:31
entrepreneurial careers to help you think about opportunities
30:36
to identify um forces, trends, etc. that you can leverage to create really
30:43
innovative companies and products. Okay. So, here's here's how we're going to do
30:46
assessment. Uh we're going to do like we mentioned a
30:51
brief a brief class part uh class participation question each time. This
30:56
will often be from the pre-ereadings. Um so, please check those out. There's
31:01
sometimes videos uh to make it a little easier late at
31:05
night. I know people are tired, don't want to read, just watch a video.
31:08
Radalio's got some great ones like we mentioned. Hopefully you had a chance to
31:12
check one of those out um before today. Um the main grade will be from an essay
31:18
and then um there's going to be an exam as well. Okay. Yes.
31:24
Recording the video that you want to present. It's fine. Can you tell us the
31:28
title and present on the Yeah, we'll work on it. We're going to
31:31
do a quick break here uh in a minute and we can figure that out. Okay. So, let's
31:37
see here. We're let's take just a couple minutes break and then we'll come back.
31:42
We'll do the video and get into a brief introduction to economics and the
31:48
history of money and the future of money. Okay. Thank you. Two three
31:51
minutes. Is that okay? Perfect. related to the cryptocurrency and yeah
32:01
what what are your thoughts related to the cryptocurrency reserve that the US
32:06
is doing right now looking hold that thought we'll talk about that
32:11
uh yeah in the second half here
32:13
case I've been into this environment since I was 15
32:16
okay so I'm very passionate about
32:18
great can I can I copy and paste this to you
32:24
or how should I starting and we go to settings.
32:33
Settings. Yes.
32:35
Uh I mean like system settings. Okay.
32:43
display or something or besides that I don't know after the
32:56
class you have like a free moment we can talk about everything because I'm very
32:59
curious and I will like to know what is the current
33:04
well that's in this environment because I heard that you said that you've been
33:09
working in VCs and all that right yes
33:12
and I have a couple questions related to Okay, great. Yeah, there will be also
33:16
some office hours. Uh I don't know that we've scheduled them, but yeah, after
33:21
class or also during office hours. Happy to talk.
33:24
Okay, cool. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Nice meeting you too, Derek. Yeah.
33:29
Yes. Yes.
33:31
And I want to like ask because people ask us what we think about AI.
33:38
But what do you think? I maybe I was like outside because I
33:42
went like outside. Yeah. What do you think about AI in the
33:46
future? I mean I'm I'm a technical optimist so I
33:52
tend to look at the bright side. This is I think one of the you know
33:56
disadvantages of being techsavvy is you tend to see always the good. Um, so I
34:05
I want to believe that it can help usher in a world of abundance, you know, where
34:11
I mean, I find AI incredibly useful already today, and I'm very excited
34:16
about it, but I might be underestimating the risk. I mean, there are some
34:20
evidence already emerging of AI not wanting to shut itself down when it's
34:25
asked to do that, cheating, being devious. Um, have you seen the Stanley
34:30
Kubri movie uh 2001 Space Odyssey? Yeah.
34:34
Yeah. I think it's
34:35
I mean I think we may underestimate that risk honestly.
34:38
I think it's going to develop like the internet. I think like there are going
34:41
to be like many benefits. I think there are also going to be persons or
34:45
individuals who are misusing it. Oh yeah.
34:48
To like a lot of I think just like the internet
34:52
potentially far more dangerous because it can execute code. It can it can do
34:56
things in the real world. It's not just a static, you know, kind of library of
35:01
information. It can program for you. It can formulate, you know, things maybe,
35:08
you know, I mean, I mean, Mission Impossible. Did you watch the Mission
35:12
Impossible last one? I mean, yeah,
35:14
because I have a logistics like a business AI business. We are optimizing
35:18
like the businesses. Okay.
35:20
And like, sorry, let me let me just because we're
35:23
running out of time here. Let's continue the conversation a minute. Do you wanna
35:26
Do you want to try plugging in? And yeah,
35:30
you found it. Okay.
35:40
What about the audio? Are there speakers in here?
35:50
me. Sorry. The
36:01
What does that mean? It means they are going to make large
36:06
asset purchases via Pomo. What does that mean?
36:09
It means that No. What about the Fed?
36:15
They announced another round of the quantitative easing.
36:31
What does that mean? So, just to set the context here, yeah,
39:14
you're all too young to have seen this video before, but this came out around
39:17
the time of the 2008 financial crisis when I think some of you were maybe just
39:21
being born. girl. No, it's uh a classic. And again, the reason I'm showing you
39:27
this is because in this class, we're going to introduced we're going to
39:32
introduce some jargon. We have to, right? We're going to talk about terms
39:37
like quantitative easing. What the hell is that? Right? And that's what this
39:42
this video is about, right? these terms that economists use, this
39:47
language, this jargon, which can sometimes make this topic more
39:52
complicated than it actually is. And in fact, some of these uh economists and
39:59
people out there will often use this jargon to deter you from even trying to
40:07
understand the big picture. Just leave it to us high priests, you know,
40:13
philosopher kings in the ivory tower. Don't you worry your little head about
40:17
the global economy. Just leave it to guys like me. You know what these terms
40:20
like quantitative easing mean. So anyway, let's let's check out the video.
40:28
No. What about the Fed? They announced another round of the
40:31
quantitative easing. What does that mean?
40:34
It means they are going to make large asset purchases via POMO.
40:37
What does that mean? It means they are going to expand their balance sheet and
40:41
buy treasuries. What does that mean?
40:44
It means they are going to print a ton of money.
40:46
So why do they call it the quantitative easing? Why don't they just call it the
40:51
printing money? Because the printing money is the last
40:54
refuge of failed economic empires and banana republics. And the Fed doesn't
40:58
want to admit this is their only idea. So why do they want to print the money?
41:02
Because they say we have the deflation and the deflation is very bad. What is
41:07
the deflation? The deflation is when prices of the
41:10
things we buy go down. Isn't that good? Doesn't it mean the
41:13
people can buy more of the stuff? Yes, but the Fed said this is bad,
41:17
especially during the recession. So, they think that during the recession
41:21
when the people have less money to buy the stuff, it is bad that the prices go
41:25
down. Yes, the Fed would rather have the
41:28
inflation. So, why does the Fed think we have the
41:31
deflation? Because the CPI said so. But aren't the
41:34
food prices higher than a year ago? Yes.
41:37
Aren't the gas prices higher than a year ago?
41:39
Yes. Aren't the health care costs higher than
41:42
a year ago? Yes.
41:43
Aren't tuition prices higher than a year ago?
41:46
Yes. Aren't the taxes higher than a year ago?
41:49
Yes. Aren't the subway fairs higher than a
41:52
year ago? Yes.
41:53
Aren't the stock prices higher than a year ago?
41:56
Yes. Aren't the bond prices higher than a
41:58
year ago? Yes.
41:59
So, what is deflating right now? The only thing deflating that I can see is
42:04
the Fed's credibility. Did they have a lot of credibility to
42:08
start with? No.
42:09
Why not? Because the Fed has been wrong about
42:12
every major economic development in the past 20 years.
42:15
You mean they didn't see the internet stock bubble?
42:18
No. In fact, they helped fuel the internet stock bubble.
42:22
And they didn't see the housing bubble. No. In fact, they helped cause the
42:26
housing bubble. And they didn't see the subprime crisis.
42:29
No. In fact, they told us some prime problems were contained right before the
42:33
[ __ ] hit the fan and the Leman went bankrupt.
42:36
So, has the Fed ever been right about anything?
42:38
Let me see if I can think of anything. Nope. Nothing.
42:46
Who runs the Fed? The Fed is run by the Ben Bernank.
42:49
Does the Ben Bernank have a lot of business experience?
42:52
No. The Ben Bernank has no business experience. Does the Ben Bernank have a
42:57
lot of policy experience? No. The Ben Bernank has no policy
43:02
experience. Has the Ben Bernank ever run in an
43:04
election? No. The Ben Bernank has never run in an
43:08
election. So, what qualifies him to run the Fed?
43:11
I don't know. Maybe the fact that he has a nice beard.
43:14
But my plumber also has a nice beard. And I would not trust him to play God
43:18
with the economy. No. Although, when you call the plumber
43:21
to fix something that is broken, they usually fix it, not break it more. This
43:25
is true. The plumber is clearly smarter than the Ben Bernank.
43:29
Well, that is why he became a plumber and not an economist.
43:33
How does the Fed execute the quantitative easing?
43:35
They print the money and then they buy the Treasury bonds.
43:39
Do they buy the Treasury bonds from the Treasury Department?
43:42
No, they buy the Treasury bonds from the Goldman Sachs.
43:45
You must be [ __ ] me. No.
43:47
So, let me get this straight. If I want to buy the Treasury bonds with my money,
43:52
I can buy them directly from the Treasury. Yes.
43:55
And if you want to buy the Treasury bonds with your money, you can buy them
43:59
from the Treasury. Right.
44:01
But if the Ben Bernank wants to buy the Treasury bonds using the American
44:04
people's money, he does not buy them from the Treasury. He buys them from the
44:08
Goldman Sachs. Exactly.
44:10
And does the Goldman Sachs give them a good price?
44:13
Of course not. They are the Goldman Sachs. They make their living ripping
44:16
off the American people. But how is the Goldman Sachs able to do
44:20
this? The Fed announces what it is going to buy and when it is going to buy
44:25
before it does the trade. So the Goldman Sachs can frontr run the
44:28
Fed and give them the worst possible price on the Treasury bonds.
44:32
Yes, exactly. And the Fed is okay with this blatant
44:35
theft from the American people. Of course. Otherwise, the Fed would just
44:40
buy the Treasury bonds directly from the Treasury Department.
44:43
Who inside the Fed is responsible for the buying of the Treasury bonds? The
44:47
buying of the Treasury bonds is conducted by the New York branch of the
44:51
Federal Reserve. And who is in charge of the New York
44:53
branch? The head of the New York branch is the
44:56
William Dudley. And what did the William Dudley do
44:59
before running the New York Fed? Before running the New York Fed, the
45:02
William Dudley was a partner at the Goldman Sachs.
45:05
So the guy in charge of the American people's money when dealing with the
45:09
Goldman Sachs used to be a partner at the Goldman Sachs.
45:12
Yes. And nobody has a problem with this?
45:14
Apparently not. Is this an episode of the Twilight Zone?
45:19
I don't think so. Are you sure?
45:21
Pretty sure. So, what you are telling me is that the
45:24
Fed thinks prices are going down when in fact they are going up.
45:27
Yeah. And they think during the recession with
45:30
the high unemployment, it is better if the things people need to buy cost more
45:34
money. Correct. According to the Ben Bernank,
45:36
the inflation will create the jobs and improve the housing market.
45:40
Has this ever been tried before? Yes. Just last year, the Fed tried the
45:44
quantitative easing with $2 trillion. Did that create the jobs?
45:48
No. Did it help the housing market?
45:50
Not at all. Did it help anybody at all?
45:53
Yes, it helped the Goldman Sachs. How much of the money are they printing
45:57
now? $600 billion.
46:00
So, even though the first two trillion did not create the jobs or improve the
46:04
housing market, the Fed decided to do another 600 billion anyway.
46:08
Yes. Who put the Ben Bernank in charge? The
46:11
Ben Bernank was first appointed by the President Bush, then he was reappointed
46:15
by the President Obama. But wasn't the President Obama supposed
46:19
to bring the change? Yes.
46:21
How is putting in charge the same fool who has been wrong about everything? The
46:25
change? Well, under the President Bush, the Ben
46:28
Bernang only blew up the American economy. Under the President Obama, he
46:33
is working on blowing up the entire global economy.
46:36
That does not sound like the change we can believe in.
46:39
Definitely not. Who else supports the Ben Bernank?
46:42
Most economists around the world think the quantitative easing is very
46:46
dangerous. Does anyone think it is a good idea?
46:49
Yes, the people at the Goldman Sachs. Is this some kind of nightmare?
46:53
No, it is very real. I want to bang my head against the wall.
46:57
You should not do that. Why not?
46:59
Because the healthcare is too expensive. But didn't the President Obama fix that?
47:04
No, but that is the subject of a whole other video. Goodbye.
47:28
So lots of lots of terminology there. Inflation, deflation, quantitative
47:33
easing, some old characters from uh yester year
47:37
like Ben Bernani which the computerenerated
47:41
characters called the Ben Bernank. He was a former governor of the uh Federal
47:45
Reserve. uh Bill Dudley, who was mentioned in that video, the uh head of
47:50
the New York Federal Reserve branch, the former partner at the Goldman Sachs.
47:54
He's famous for something else. Um I still can't believe he wrote this
47:59
article. This is probably about 5 years ago, but back when Trump was running for
48:06
reelection in the year 2020, and this is after Bill Dudley left the
48:11
New York Fed, so he was not a Federal Reserve central bank governor any
48:16
longer, but he actually wrote in Bloomberg uh Bloomberg's opinion pages
48:23
that the presidential election should be a matter for central banks to be
48:29
concerned concerned about and it's within
48:33
the authority and purview of central banks to actually
48:38
try to influence an election. Does anyone know how a central bank
48:45
might influence an election? Who who knows how a central bank
48:51
maybe like uh like higher interest rates or lower interest rates.
48:56
Exactly. Yeah. So, central banks have a huge
48:59
influence over the supply of money. And when there's more money, which was a lot
49:05
of what that video was about, trying to like inflate asset prices to save the
49:10
housing market, to save the financial markets from crashing. You know, people
49:14
feel wealthier, people are happier, people are more likely to not vote for
49:20
change, to keep the person who's in charge in charge. And what Dudley was
49:26
arguing was that the central bank, this is this is just unbelievably I mean that
49:31
he went out and said this publicly, should basically try to prevent Trump
49:34
from getting reelected in 2020. That that was a legitimate central bank
49:40
action to engage in. Okay.
49:45
So brief introduction to economics. We've got till what time do we have to
49:49
wrap at 10:30? 45
49:53
11 45 Okay, great. Good.
49:59
Okay, this is economic history on one slide.
50:06
This shows GDP growth, the size of the economy for
50:12
the last 2,000 years. All right, for most of recorded history, right?
50:18
What what do you see? This red line is the size of the global economy for 2,000
50:24
years. What's happening here? Yeah. Nothing. Right. Basically,
50:32
everyone's like living subsistence level,
50:36
you know, you know, handtomouth for basically the last the 1800 years up
50:43
until what event? Yes. In 1971
50:49
before that, let's go back to the 1700s roughly. Yes.
50:53
Industrial revolution. Absolutely. Perfect. Yes. This thing
50:57
called the industrial revolution happen starting in places like uh the
51:01
Netherlands and the UK around the 1700s and we see this incredible thing happen
51:07
where economic growth goes exponential, goes parabolic. Right? This is the
51:13
hockey stick that Silicon Valley venture capitalists dream of. Right? You have
51:17
product market fit. That's economic history basically in a
51:22
nutshell. And why is that important? Why does that matter? Why does all this
51:26
growth this increase in the number of products
51:31
and services that the economy is producing? Why does why do we care about
51:36
that? Is more stuff just inherently good?
51:42
Should we just have more stuff? Well,
51:50
there's actually pretty strong evidence that it's associated with things like
51:53
longer life expectancy. So, we start to see people living longer as the
51:59
resources that we have available to consume to support us through food.
52:04
People started growing a lot taller. Like that's one of the ways economic
52:09
historians study economic growth is they actually go back and they measure dead
52:14
people and look at heights because that's a really strong indicator of how
52:19
much food and sugar and other you know nutrients you had and when there were
52:25
big changes, right? So life expectancy starts rocketing upwards, you know, in
52:32
correlation with economic growth. Height starts increasing. Um, it's not just
52:37
about, you know, having things like iPhones. We also see strong linkages
52:42
with with health. So that's kind of the big big story of economic history.
52:48
Basically, for most of human recorded history, you know, we were peasants, we
52:53
were farmers, subsistence level living, and then the industrial revolution
52:58
created this incredible, incredible event. Okay, remember this is
53:05
just a brief introduction to economics, right? We're like we are we are skipping
53:10
through a lot of things, but I want to try to touch on some really important
53:14
things. So, does anyone recognize this this lady here?
53:20
Yeah, rest in peace. I don't know how everyone feels about the queen, but you
53:25
know, many loved her. Um, she died a few years ago. Um, she came to the London
53:31
School of Economics, right? I did my PhD in 2008. So, right after the Lehman hit
53:37
the fan, as the cartoon character said, Lehman Brothers was an investment bank
53:41
that was allowed to go bankrupt and that's when really the whole system
53:46
started to seize up like an engine on a plane, right? You know, it's like the
53:50
whole is going to crash. She comes to the London School of Economics. This is
53:56
not the London School of Economics. This looks more like the vaults of the Bank
53:58
of England or the New York Fed where there's a lot of gold as well. Um, but
54:02
she came to I think like you know commission or be there for a new
54:07
building. She would often do that come when a new building was going to be
54:10
opened up and they had all the economics faculty lined up and the queen walked up
54:17
to all these professors some of the most esteemed well- reggarded professors in
54:23
the world. Remember this is just a couple weeks after leaving brothers
54:25
failed. and things are just going to hell. And she goes to them, why didn't
54:30
any of you see this coming? And they were speechless because she was
54:36
right. Economists did not see the 2008
54:39
financial crisis coming. All these hundreds and thousands of
54:43
economists making all sorts of money, getting all this research funding could
54:48
not see the biggest financial and economic event since the
54:53
Great Depression in the 1920s. What good
54:58
are the models and tools that they're developing if they couldn't even see the
55:01
financial crisis coming? Now, there are some people who famously did see it
55:05
coming. There's a very nice movie about this called The Big Short.
55:08
Michael, Michael Bur. Yeah. all these Steve
55:11
Eisman um you know your humble professor um you
55:17
know in 2006 so I I worked as I mentioned for one of Bill Gates buddies
55:22
we started a tech incubator in San Francisco I had seen a bubble at a
55:26
pretty young age and uh the internet bubble is an amazing thing it was great
55:30
to have a front row seat to that um it was kind of a San Francisco thing you
55:35
know it didn't spread like the housing crisis did globally or even nationally
55:40
But I knew what a bubble looked like at a young age. And around 2006, the way
55:46
people were talking about houses, I was like, hm, I feel like I've seen this
55:50
seen this movie before. I didn't lose money.
55:57
I did not. Shorting housing was not easy in 2006. Yeah.
56:02
Yeah. you know, if you're Steve Eisman or Michael Bur and can negotiate
56:05
derivatives contracts with Goldman, but if you're a starving PhD student,
56:09
it's not so not so easy to do that. But there were yeah a few people who saw it.
56:14
But the queen was right to ask economists why did they not see this
56:18
coming? And a lot of them have focused on fancy theory. A lot of economists
56:23
actually, just so you know, some of the top economists are what um you know, I
56:29
mean, they they literally are kind of like people with physics envy. They are
56:32
failed physicists who are enthralled with mathematics, fancy mathematics that
56:38
actually doesn't have any real world applicability.
56:42
And and that's partly what that video was pushing back on. Why are we trusting
56:46
these economists to run central banks? Now, it turns out today the two biggest
56:51
central banks, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are actually run
56:55
by lawyers. So, we don't trust economists anymore to to run these
56:59
institutions. Perhaps in part because the queen asked her question. Why didn't
57:05
you guys see this coming? Why am I telling you all this? I'm wanting to
57:09
give you some insight into some of the criticisms and problems with
57:16
um the way some of the people pre- Ray Dalio, pre
57:22
Peter Turin, pre Ken Rogoff's incredible empirical work on the history of
57:27
financial crisis, some of these people just did not have
57:32
the right mental framework and approach, I think, to understanding the world as
57:36
it truly is right and I think that's also nicely illustrated here by this
57:42
contraption built in the 1950s I believe the Moniac the Phillips hydraulic
57:49
computer literally is a machine that professor Phillips at the school of
57:54
economics developed that shows water kind of flowing from different
57:59
compartments um you know to show how the economy is is functioning. Wish we had
58:04
more time and we could uh we could we could get into that. But economists very
58:10
much thought about the economy as kind of a machine, right? With like things
58:16
flowing from one part of the economy to the other and very mechanical like a a
58:21
clockwork watch, right? But others like my PhD supervisor Neil
58:28
Ferguson have studied human history, human psychology,
58:32
have read great authors like Fodor Dossi, amazing
58:37
amazing author, highly recommend Dossi if you haven't read him. He had this
58:42
wonderful thing to say about human nature.
58:46
We humans may consciously purposely desire what is injurous to himself, what
58:53
is stupid, very stupid, simply in order to have the right to not be bound by an
59:00
obligation to desire only what is sensible. In other words, humans don't
59:05
always behave rationally. Right? That is kind of the fatal flaw of
59:10
a lot of economic thinking. Macroeconomic thinking, micro is great,
59:15
by the way. I know you were studying microeconomics recently. That's much
59:18
more predictive and useful than a lot of macroeconomics.
59:21
But humans often will do things that are stupid or irrational
59:25
in Dosseski's language simply to prove that they have the power and control to
59:30
do that. Right?
59:34
So humans are not computers. We don't
59:39
respond always rationally to things. And that's that makes it very hard to model
59:44
what humans will do in a given situation. Historians, psychologists,
59:49
sociologists, anthropologists all have something to contribute about
59:55
how the global economy functions, how the world can shift. It's not just about
1:00:02
mathematical models and equations. And
1:00:08
I think another I'm going to Skip this here. Oops, we went ahead
1:00:14
here. Excuse me. Um,
1:00:18
I've mentioned the LSC a few times. It's famous school. We just had another Nobel
1:00:24
Prize in economics awarded to one of our faculty. Um,
1:00:30
this is the logo logo for the London School of Economics LSC,
1:00:37
right? But there's something missing from this logo. Um, this is not the full
1:00:43
name of the London School of Economics. The London School of Economics is
1:00:50
actually the London School of Economics and Political Science.
1:00:56
We just have the LSE here, but they cut off the political science. Now, why am I
1:01:00
mentioning this to you? Because economics and this someone came up in
1:01:04
the in the in the um the break and asked me about this. Economics is inherently
1:01:09
political. There's a lot of political choices, winners and losers to put it
1:01:15
plainly that come with economic policy. All right? And it's important to
1:01:20
remember that in this world of economics, there's an
1:01:24
inherent political dimension to it. Okay.
1:01:30
So, now we're gonna get to the last subject we want to cover. But I
1:01:36
think before we do that, maybe we should just quickly do the quiz or class
1:01:42
particip we'll do that at the end. Why don't we do that at the end? Is that
1:01:44
okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Money.
1:01:53
What is it? Where does it come from? I don't know
1:01:59
that my Am Michelle Rothschild actually said this. It's a quote that's often
1:02:05
attributed to the founder of the house of Rothschild, very famous European
1:02:09
banking dynasty. Uh Neil, Sir Neil did his his first I think most important
1:02:17
work on kind of the the history of the Rothschild families. They opened up
1:02:20
their archive to him and it's an incredible incredible piece of
1:02:23
scholarship. Um but my Amsel Rothschild is is thought to have said something
1:02:29
like this. Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws.
1:02:39
Really? Is money more powerful than the law?
1:02:43
That's what supposedly Rosschild thought. Well, that begs the question of
1:02:47
where does this thing called money come from, right? Well, it used to grow on
1:02:52
trees. quite literally right in the UK where I live for 10 years, it was paper
1:02:59
until they switched to plastic. Does anyone else have plastic money in the
1:03:02
country they come from now? Yeah, it's Yeah, we're Yeah, it's becoming more
1:03:07
popular to get rid of the good oldfashioned stuff that literally grew
1:03:10
on trees, the paper, and and make it out of plastic, right? It's more durable.
1:03:15
But what I'm interested in is not where the actual things that money are made
1:03:20
out of come from. I want to ask you who literally manufactures this stuff into
1:03:27
existence. Who is making this? Yeah, we got a clue with that video we
1:03:32
watched, right? Plenty of money, but go ahead. Yes,
1:03:39
the BIS. Um, yeah, we don't have a lot of time to
1:03:44
talk about the BIS. I've spent time there. Um, yeah, the bank. Just real
1:03:48
quickly, the answer is correct. Central banks or the mint or the government are
1:03:54
who actually make the notes and coins in our pockets. If you still carry around
1:03:58
money, does anyone actually carry cash around anymore? Still a few people do. I
1:04:02
know in some countries it's still much more commonly used than others. in
1:04:07
Sweden and South Korea or even China, it's hard to sometimes pay with cash.
1:04:12
But uh um I think most people know that the BIS is actually not someone that
1:04:18
makes any money. The BIS is um a very interesting institution. It likes to
1:04:24
advertise itself as a central bank of central banks, but it's actually not
1:04:29
true. They don't. A central bank real quickly is something that is there when
1:04:37
banks have a problem and can kind of backs stop and be a lender of last
1:04:41
resort. We can talk more about that if you're interested in that. This is
1:04:44
getting more into the mechanics of central banking than I really wanted to
1:04:47
do, but the BIS doesn't really do that. Yeah. When someone has a problem, they
1:04:52
don't call the BIS. They call the New York Fed. They call Bill Dudley.
1:04:57
The New York Fed is the back is the real central bank that backs stops not just
1:05:02
the US economy but the rest of the world as well. But that's a whole another
1:05:06
topic. Anyway, if you were to go out in the streets here in Dubai and ask people
1:05:13
where does money come from? Where do the notes and coins in your pockets come
1:05:16
from? I bet you over 90% of the people would answer this question correctly
1:05:20
like you have that this comes from central banks or the government or men.
1:05:25
I think most people in the street, the man and the woman in the street know
1:05:28
that. All right. Not everyone's lucky like you and gets
1:05:33
to come to Tedar. All right. Um, keep that in mind. There's a whole population
1:05:38
out there that doesn't get to learn about this in classrooms like this. So,
1:05:44
think about what you know, but also think about what the folks in the street
1:05:47
know. Okay. Next question is what percentage
1:05:52
of the total money supply do the notes and coins in our pockets the physical
1:05:59
tangible money we can touch what percentage of the total money supply
1:06:04
does that represent is it a big percentage small percentage
1:06:10
small depends on the country in some countries it's very tiny like we talked
1:06:15
about in Sweden and South Korea in other countries it's bigger like Germany,
1:06:20
Japan I think are very cashoriented still. Yes.
1:06:24
What does it depend like their culture because people more used to it?
1:06:28
Correct. Yes. There's cultural reasons that um the Germans for example anyone
1:06:34
German in here very averse to like historically I think it's changing but
1:06:39
historically Germans were more distrustful of credit cards and
1:06:45
yeah know cash percentage was higher there. Um uh
1:06:52
Argentina is a country there's actually more US dollars in Argentina than there
1:06:56
are in the US. um physical currency. Um 75% of the US
1:07:02
$100 bills are actually outside of the US. Little interesting statistic for
1:07:07
you. Anyway, it depends. But in most countries, this stuff, the stuff we can
1:07:13
touch is actually a smaller percentage, right, of the total money supply.
1:07:19
Okay? All right. So if the stuff the the the part of the money supply that we can
1:07:26
touch is a small percentage and this stuff is being made by the
1:07:32
governments or central banks or the mints who is making who is manufacturing
1:07:37
into existence the rest of the money so if the government the federal federal
1:07:42
reserve the central bank ECB bank of India etc if they're only making a tiny
1:07:47
percentage of the total money supply I mean actually producing making it. Think
1:07:51
of it like manufacturing. Who is manufacturing the rest of the money
1:07:55
supply? I'm going to ask you who makes the rest of the money.
1:08:04
It's not an easy question to answer. This is the question that when you go
1:08:07
out into the streets, not just this classroom, most people would have a hard
1:08:11
time answering. Yes.
1:08:17
How did you know that? That's absolutely perfect.
1:08:24
The banks, HSBC,
1:08:29
JP Morgan, Bank of America, Bank of, you know, the
1:08:34
the commercial banks, Sumitomo, I I forget all Mitsubishi, all the different
1:08:38
banks around the world. They're the ones who are making the vast majority of the
1:08:42
money, who are manufacturing into existence, just as she said, by making a
1:08:47
loan. Right? So when you go to the bank to borrow money to buy a house, to get a
1:08:54
mortgage, the bank lends new money into existence.
1:08:59
It creates through money by making a loan. If you want a car loan,
1:09:04
new money is created. That's the magic of banking. Banks have
1:09:10
this unique power to actually increase the money supply. And they do that by
1:09:15
making a loan. It's literally just changing numbers on
1:09:19
a spreadsheet or in a computer system to increase the money supply. Okay? And
1:09:25
these banks or are generally for-profit institutions with shareholders. Right?
1:09:30
So in other words, the vast majority of our money n more than 90% of the money
1:09:34
in the world is created by private for-profit corporations, not by the
1:09:40
government. Most of our money is created by the
1:09:44
private sector by the capitalist system. Yes.
1:09:48
So that doesn't create like the whole imbalance of the situation because how
1:09:52
are how are they controlled in the sense of okay you can make this amount of
1:09:57
money or they just don't care. They just create like
1:10:01
Yes. So great question. Can banks make an unlimited amount of money? And the
1:10:06
answer is generally no. They are regulated. There are some of the most
1:10:10
regulated institutions in the world and they're regulated by the central banks
1:10:16
and often other regulators who will say in order to make a loan you need to have
1:10:22
a certain amount of reserves on deposit. So this is what's known as the
1:10:27
fractional reserve system. We're not going to get into this in any great
1:10:31
depth. We just don't have the time. But a simple way of thinking about it is if
1:10:35
Garrick goes to the bank and I deposit $1 at the bank, that bank can now create
1:10:42
$10 worth of loans. All right? So, it can increase the money
1:10:47
supply by 10x because it has my $1 on deposit.
1:10:54
Okay? That's what it means to have a fractional reserve. They have a fraction
1:10:59
of the loans they've created held in reserve.
1:11:04
All right. To back up those loans. They literally just type some numbers
1:11:12
into a computer. You come to the bank and I just create
1:11:17
it for you. So, imagine I'm the bank. I literally
1:11:21
could just write on a piece of paper $10. Here you go. And because I am a
1:11:27
bank, and this is literally how it used to work in the old days, the Bank of
1:11:31
Garrick, you could take that to the Bank of John and they say, "Oh, that's a Bank
1:11:35
of Garrick $10 note. I trust that. I'm going to get I'm going to I'm going to
1:11:40
redeem that or, you know, value that at $10 at face value." Yes.
1:11:52
Whenever money changed guarantee that
1:11:59
they're going to always
1:12:17
Yeah. Yeah, it's a great question. So, yeah,
1:12:28
we're we're not going to get into the complete history of money, but money has
1:12:32
taken many different forms throughout history. And sometimes it's been shells,
1:12:39
you know, shells like seashells. It's been gold. It's been pieces of paper
1:12:46
that, you know, an emperor in China said should be treated as money or a central
1:12:53
bank in New York says to treat his money. It's been, you know, sometimes
1:13:00
things that are real and have real what we call intrinsic value or utility.
1:13:04
They're useful for something other than money. So gold can be used in industrial
1:13:09
processes. It can be used in dentistry. It can be used in art, jewelry, right?
1:13:13
It has other uses besides its monetary use. So, it's a commodity,
1:13:19
you know, but it can also be used as money. Whereas, there are things that
1:13:23
are just pure money, right? Like the pieces of paper that
1:13:30
yes, you could light, you could start a fire with your your dollar bills and
1:13:34
that could be your fire starter for a campfire, right? Yes, it has some other
1:13:38
utility. You could wipe your butt with it, right? like but it's mostly just
1:13:42
monetary value right that gives it its function it usefulness yes
1:13:49
do you think at a certain point how much money
1:13:56
because right now human
1:14:03
it's already here so so banks are already using AI in lending decisions
1:14:08
and like we talked about the loan is how new money is created. So, I think AI is
1:14:13
already helping to create how much money we have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's
1:14:21
complicated, but we could spend a lot of time going down this kind of history
1:14:24
money rabbit hole. There's a couple key points I wanted to make. One is now you
1:14:30
know something that the person in the street does not know which is the vast
1:14:34
majority of our money comes from private for-profit institutions that we
1:14:39
generally call banks. Now why doesn't everyone know this? This is one of the
1:14:45
most foundational fundamental kind of things money right we talked about that
1:14:52
so many people rely on and use every day and yet we don't know where it comes
1:14:56
from. Why aren't we taught this? You shouldn't have to come to a
1:15:01
university to learn this. You should be learning this in secondary schools and
1:15:04
high schools, right? Why?
1:15:09
Why? Well, I've asked central bankers this question. I go, "Do you you realize
1:15:14
how few people understand what it is I have to go around the world and teach?"
1:15:19
And they're like, "Yes, we like it that way.
1:15:24
We like it that way." Garrick. Okay. So,
1:15:34
is Bitcoin money? How many people here think Bitcoin is
1:15:38
money? How many people think Bitcoin is not
1:15:42
money? About 5050. How many are not sure?
1:15:47
Most of you are not sure. That's the largest one. Good. Good answers. All
1:15:51
those answers are great answers. And by the way, I've been asking that question
1:15:56
for over 10 years, and the answer almost comes back identical to what what what
1:16:02
we just saw here, where about half an equal number say yes and no, and a bunch
1:16:07
of people aren't sure, right? And that's and that's a very reasonable I think
1:16:13
position to to have based on again how little we're taught about money which I
1:16:18
think is one of the great injustices this financial illiteracy this economic
1:16:24
illiteracy is such importantful powerful institution that shapes the shifting
1:16:28
world order how little we understand the foundational elements of it that's why
1:16:32
it's so important to cover this right up front before we even get into like Dalio
1:16:35
and all this other stuff but I think we can kind go a little further in
1:16:40
understanding money by focusing on Bitcoin and thinking about does it meet
1:16:45
the definition of money. So let's quickly cover what an economist
1:16:52
would say the definition of money is
1:16:57
in most economic textbooks. Um an economist will say well money has to
1:17:04
meet these three kind of definitions. that has these three functions. It has
1:17:09
to be a medium of exchange. It has to be something we use to buy and sell things.
1:17:15
It has to store value. It has to be something that's worth something from
1:17:20
one day to the next. And then it has to be the unit of account. And this is
1:17:25
probably the least well understood of the three. And unit of account simply
1:17:29
means what goods are and services are priced at.
1:17:34
So in most countries there's a single unit of account.
1:17:39
You know you go to France it's the euro. You go to Japan it's the yen.
1:17:44
Everything's priced in in those things uh in in that unit basically. All right.
1:17:50
Now one way of thinking about oops one way of thinking about these three
1:17:55
functions is not all these three functions are equal in the sense of how
1:18:02
many other things can be a store of value. That's the biggest circle here.
1:18:07
Many many things can be a store of value. What else besides money can be a
1:18:10
store of value? Land. Yes.
1:18:13
Gold. Gold. Yes.
1:18:16
Art. Yes. Digital commodities.
1:18:18
Digital commodities. Yes. oil,
1:18:21
copper. Yeah. Collectibles,
1:18:25
a car. Is a car a store of value? Is it a good store of value?
1:18:32
Depends. In the COVID pandemic, used car prices went up.
1:18:38
I actually made money on my used cars incredibly. But it's true that a car is
1:18:46
maybe not as good a store of value as something like a Van Go or a piece of
1:18:52
land or gold, right? A car kind of predictably goes down in value, but it
1:18:58
still stores some value from year to year, right? Something like gold has
1:19:03
doubled in value in the last couple years. That looks like a great store of
1:19:08
value, but guess what? Gold doesn't always go up in value. In fact, during
1:19:12
the 2008 financial crisis, does anyone know what happened to gold? When Lehman
1:19:17
Brothers failed and the stock market crashed, guess what gold did? It
1:19:21
crashed. The only thing that went up was the US
1:19:24
dollar. Everyone sold pretty much everything and piled into the US dollar.
1:19:29
Gold crashed. Bitcoin crashed. Well, actually, Bitcoin didn't exist back
1:19:33
then. Sorry. Um, we'll talk about Bitcoin crashes here in just a minute,
1:19:38
but yep. Getting very philosophical and
1:19:44
metaphysical here. Well, can you store time?
1:19:53
I mean, the dream for all, right, is to reach
1:19:58
right now. You know, most young people have not enough money and too much time.
1:20:04
The dream is to one day get to a point, right, where you have enough money and
1:20:09
not enough time, right? And you start to change your life priorities. But I don't
1:20:13
know that time would be a store of value. Interesting question, though. Um,
1:20:17
yes. Yeah. Electricity.
1:20:23
Sure. Yeah. Anything that could be stored
1:20:30
could be potentially a store of value. Like airtime minutes in in Africa, I I
1:20:35
was aware that people would sometimes use like mobile phone minutes is like a
1:20:40
currency. I don't know that that's going on as much anymore, but people would
1:20:44
trade SIM cards with stored minutes as kind of a currency.
1:20:49
Many things can be a store of value, but fewer things are a medium of exchange,
1:20:54
right? So what else can you use to transact besides money?
1:21:02
Time, right? You can trade your time for
1:21:05
something, right? Um, you know, when you you can trade
1:21:10
your attention in our internet connected world, your
1:21:15
eyeballs and your time looking at an advertisement is your currency
1:21:21
for watching a video on YouTube, right? I'll show you the video, you give me
1:21:28
your attention and watch this advertisement. That's a trade that just
1:21:32
happened there, right? Didn't require any money.
1:21:37
So fewer things can be a medium of exchange but usually as I mentioned
1:21:44
there is a single unit of account in each country. Now it's true you can I
1:21:49
I've had contracts actually denominated in Bitcoin like I was paid to go speak
1:21:54
and literally it was a nominal amount of Bitcoin that I was paid right like
1:21:59
whatever it was. Now, a few months went by, the price of Bitcoin went up, and
1:22:03
the organization wanted to renegotiate. Say, Garrick, hey, you know, back when
1:22:09
we did this contract, the price of Bitcoin was down here, it went to here,
1:22:12
so we think we should pay you the pound sterling amount of when even though the
1:22:16
contract said X amount of Bitcoin, right?
1:22:18
Did you get the Bitcoin? I did. I I I I was really upset about
1:22:21
this. I was like, look, you're talking to an economics guy who understands unit
1:22:25
of account. This contract was denominated in Bitcoin. You're paying me
1:22:28
the nominal amount of Bitcoin. But that's pretty unusual, right? When I was
1:22:32
in Cambridge, I found a pub that actually accepted
1:22:36
Bitcoin and I went and bought a Sunday chicken roast lunch with Bitcoin.
1:22:44
All right, but so you might say, "Oh, well, Garrick, you're using Bitcoin as a
1:22:49
medium of exchange, right? And it's been storing value for over 15 years." Yeah,
1:22:54
it's been volatile, but so are a lot of things. Like we talked about gold
1:22:57
plummeted, currencies plummeted plummet, you know, the, you know, national
1:23:03
current like the pound dropped, you know, after Brexit 15%, you know, some
1:23:07
currencies, uh, the ruble can drop 50%, you know, in a given year. Um, you know,
1:23:12
a lot of things are volatile, right? But they store some value year in year out.
1:23:16
So maybe you could say Bitcoin is volatile. It's a store of value
1:23:18
exchange. But is it a unit of account? Well, imagine me at the pub buying that
1:23:24
chicken lunch. All right, with Bitcoin a week later,
1:23:29
so if I bought it last week and the price of Bitcoin drops 50%.
1:23:35
And I'm back the next week to buy the same chicken lunch with Bitcoin, how
1:23:41
much Bitcoin am I paying for that same lunch?
1:23:45
Double. Double. That's right. Because
1:23:49
Bitcoin is not the real unit of account at the pub in Cambridge,
1:23:54
right? Yes, they'll take my Bitcoin for the chicken, but the real unit of
1:23:59
account is pound sterling. And because the price of Bitcoin dropped 50% between
1:24:04
the first time I bought the chicken and the next, you know, purchase, they want
1:24:08
twice as much Bitcoin, right? So, it's misleading
1:24:12
to think that it's a unit of account at the pub. All right. So, a lot of
1:24:17
economists would tell you Bitcoin does not meet the definition of money. I
1:24:20
think we have to stop there and do the quick quiz. So, that was a very
1:24:24
whirlwind quick introduction to economics and money. Um, thank you. And
1:24:29
do you want to plug in here now? Yep. Okay.
1:27:31
eh ah
1:27:39
ah ah Ah,
1:28:00
hey. ah
1:28:32
e a.

How to translate a business model into a business plan?
03/11/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Mr. Garrick Hileman
0:13
Okay, great. So, let's begin.
0:21
Today, we're going to learn about lookups.
0:26
What do you guys know about lookups? Has anybody used the lookup before on Excel?
0:32
No. Okay. Anybody else? What do you think a lookup
0:37
is? What do you think an Excel lookup is?
0:45
Yes. Search for something.
0:47
Search for something. Okay. How do you think we search for things on on Excel?
0:54
Maximum minimum. Maximum minimum. Okay. That's one way.
0:58
It's one way to identify top or bottom elements in a data set. But is that how
1:05
you look for something? Someone told me Ctrl FR H. You guys have used that
1:10
before. Okay, it's not that. It is how to
1:14
automate lookups on Excel. Which means that if you have a list of things that
1:19
you're looking for including product categories or you want to know what do
1:24
your supplier is especially in your drop shipping businesses and you have
1:28
thousands and thousands of data sets you don't want to just do F right to try to
1:33
find what the supplier is. You want to create a formula that will give you for
1:39
every type of supplier, every type of product, what the let's say respective
1:44
uh supplier cost is, what the shipping time is. Okay. So, we're going to learn
1:48
today how to automate Excel automate uh sorry lookups on Excel so that you can
1:54
find data or the data that you're looking for specifically through uh kind
1:59
of in an automated way. All right. So, we'll start if you can open your uh
2:05
practical sessions as well. We're going to do this a bit more of a hands-on
2:09
exercise today or hands-on session where we're going to learn how to automate
2:14
lookups and how to use relatively advanced formulas including maximum and
2:19
minimum, small and large, and how to incorporate uh formulas like if error,
2:26
right? An if error formula basically will highlight to you or or give you a a
2:32
value of when let's say your formula is wrong or there's some type of mistake.
2:37
So it's a really cool way to make sure that you errorproof your formulas. Okay.
2:45
So the manual retrieval problem means that if you have all of these lists of
2:50
data and you want to retrieve the order number for June 24,
2:54
how would you do that typically on Excel? Like let's say I want you to find
2:57
me June 24 here. Any ideas?
3:04
No. So I could look here and go down the list and say okay I have here June 24
3:11
and so the order number is 4008 and I can do that but if I have a million rows
3:18
I can't right and so a lookup function will dramatically reduce the time spent
3:23
trying to literally look for things right you want to find the order number
3:27
you want to find a certain customer who let's say
3:32
um you know has some type of issue their order. I use lookup functions a lot in
3:37
my business. So in my business, which is a a tipping business, I have to do
3:42
reconciliations every single week to pay out people their tips. And if I want to,
3:47
let's say, um identify what the order or total tip value is for each of these
3:54
individuals, for each of my customers, and I have to do it one by one. It will
3:58
take me a really long time, and I probably make a lot of mistakes. But I
4:01
use formulas like XLOOKUP and VLOOKUP and index match so that I can actually
4:07
prepare reconciliations and pay out my customers. So receive tips that week
4:11
which is what I was doing now for those who saw me earlier. Okay. So it's quite
4:16
useful. It's not something that is just theoretical. This is things that you
4:20
will be really really helpful for you in especially in your drop shipping
4:23
business. All right. So what are the different types of lookup formulas? And
4:28
there's there's quite a few, right? And this is just a selection of them, but
4:32
essentially there are like there are four main ones or four ones that I like
4:38
to use. The first one is VLOOKUP. So VLOOKUP is literally V for vertical.
4:46
VLOOKUP is a vertical lookup which means that it will look at a column
4:51
and give you the respective row that has the data that you're looking for. And
4:57
the way that it would work is that you have let's say you are looking for like
5:01
we were looking for before June 24. So you would tell it to look for something
5:05
in the column that has the dates and you would tell it where to look. So where to
5:11
give you the answer and then a range lookup is a true or false basically
5:15
meaning if you want an exact match or an approximate match. Okay. An hookup is a
5:21
horizontal lookup. So, Vertical, Horizontal,
5:25
which means that you give it a row and you tell it to give you the
5:30
corresponding column. And we're going to do a practical exercise because if I
5:33
explain HLOOKUP and XLOOKUP to you, it's not going to be as intuitive. It's
5:38
better to practice. And we're going to do these practices together.
5:41
An index match is quite a robust tool that you can use so that if especially
5:48
when you want to find uh certain let's say qualitative categories in um your
5:54
data set and the way that it would work is that you would index an array. So
5:59
you'd index a table and then you would tell it match column number row number
6:05
and it'll find you the intersection. Okay.
6:09
I think it's a little bit echoey. Yeah.
6:16
Okay. Finally, there's XLOOKUP. Xookup is actually relatively new Excel feature
6:23
that came out maybe less than two to three years ago. And an XLOOKUP is quite
6:29
is a much more robust version of a VLOOKUP and an HLOOKUP. So it is
6:34
basically a replacement for these two. But it's good to still know VLOOKUP and
6:39
HLOOKUP. Probably in your use cases you will use XLOOKUP.
6:44
XLOOKUP is a more dynamic way to find lookups and to find certain data. And
6:49
it's a way for you to tell it where you want it to look and what you want it to
6:54
give you regardless of whether it's a row or a column. Right? when with
7:00
VLOOKUP you can only do it with columns and HLOOKUP it's only with rows so
7:03
Xookup was developed to be much more dynamic so much more dynamic way to do
7:09
lookups all right is it clear so far yeah okay
7:16
so let's uh open our in-class assignments and let's do a VLOOKUP
7:22
together okay because I think it's easier than trying to explain a formula
7:26
on PowerPoint Right. So with VLOOKUPs,
7:36
we're going to do a quick summary and then we're going to
7:41
do the um
7:45
we're going to do the um other assignments afterwards. Okay. Can you
7:50
see can you see this properly? What is it?
7:56
The in-class assignment if you can download it on resources.
8:09
All right. So, we're going to do the exercise
8:16
together starting from the beginning. Right. The first part is just the
8:20
validation part. So we just want to validate our data. So we have different
8:26
orders, different products, different categories, units sold, unit price,
8:32
revenue, supplier name, cost per unit, total cost, profit, and and profit. All
8:38
right. So
8:43
uh let's make this a table. So let's insert
8:49
and table. here and that way whatever calculations
8:54
we do will be put everywhere else. Are you with me so far?
9:00
Yeah. No. Um can you ask Miriam just to help you identify where the resources?
9:07
It's just on the LMS. Were you not able to find this?
9:14
You found this. Okay. If you can just ask me if you can help him.
9:20
Great. So step one, let's first as a revision
9:26
calculate the revenue by multiplying units sold and unit price
9:34
questions. So let's do unit sold times unit price
9:41
and the table will automatically fill this in for you.
9:51
All right with me so far. Great. The second instruction that we need to
9:56
do is to retrieve supplier name from the supplier sheet using a VLOOKUP function.
10:02
So let's take a step back and and review this. I want for each of my orders
10:09
here to find the supplier name. Yes, I can. I just never know how.
10:22
I think that's the wrong thing. Do you guys know how?
10:34
No, I think don't them there. Just them this one.
10:40
Yes. Yes.
10:44
for the revenue. Step number one is we need to calculate
10:49
the revenue by multiplying units sold times the unit price, right? P * Q.
10:57
In our data, you have the units sold for each order and the unit price. So all
11:04
you need to do is you need to equal then go to the first one here and then
11:13
times. So that's a star sign. No, no, this is step number one. Okay.
11:22
Step number two is if you see here supply supplier name,
11:28
I want to fill out this column. So we're going to do it together, right? And I'll
11:33
make sure that you also understand how to do it. Okay?
11:38
Do you see this tab suppliers? Everybody sees this tab suppliers. So let's look
11:43
at suppliers for a little bit. Suppliers has product IDs,
11:49
supplier names, supplier country, and then the cost per unit, right? And this
11:55
is on a per order basis, right? So you could get this type of
12:00
scenario where you have different products, different product ids,
12:05
different orders. Okay? And this might be later on, right? This is a
12:13
simple table, right? One order, one product, but this could be much more
12:17
complicated for much bigger data sets. But it's good. Let's get it from, you
12:21
know, the basic step first. So our first instruction is using a VLOOKUP function
12:27
to retrieve the supplier name from the supplier sheet using a VLOOKUP. Okay. So
12:33
supplier name we're going to do equal and I will zoom in a bit. Equal VLOOKUP.
12:41
So let's open that first. All right. Now, as we said, Excel helps
12:49
you out to tell you what you need to do in the formula.
12:55
So, whenever you are not sure what to do, just follow this. It will tell you
12:59
in bold where you are. If it's not bold and let's say you put a comma and it
13:03
wasn't bold, it means you maybe have a different syntax or maybe you forgot to
13:07
put one element of the formula. Okay, so first we're going to look at lookup
13:13
value. So, what are we trying to look up? Again, think about it this way.
13:17
We're trying to find the supplier name for each of the products. All right, we
13:23
looked at the supplier sheet. It gives you the product ID, supplier name,
13:28
supplier country, and the cost. So, for the lookup value, what should we put as
13:33
our lookup value? Yes, we need to find a way to connect it
13:40
to the other table. But the lookup value, where do you think that is? What?
13:44
What? What am I searching for? Which one? Supplier name. Okay.
13:52
ID. Who said ID? You said ID. I thought it was in the back. We need to look at
13:58
the product ID. Okay. If I leave this and I look back at why did I want to
14:03
look at the supplier table? You need to find a key that links two data sets
14:09
together. that key has to be unique across
14:14
the P001 product ID is a common uh data point in both tables and that's your way
14:22
to connect the two tables. All right. So with VLOOKUP the lookup value number one
14:28
is VLOOKUP
14:32
is product ID. So select this cell B2. Okay with me? so far. Great. Then comma,
14:43
we're going to put a comma here. Okay, for those who have a different
14:49
language of Excel, sometimes the comma is a semicolon. So, just pay attention
14:54
to that, especially the Spanish or German speakers.
14:58
Okay. Now, next is table array. table array is
15:06
where do I look for my data? In this case, I need to look for it in
15:13
suppliers. Okay.
15:17
So, this is the table where I want it to look.
15:22
All right. So go to your supplier sheet and let us
15:29
select this table.
15:34
Right? Again you can do control shift down control shift right
15:40
with your keyboards. Maybe control shift space as well could
15:46
work. Okay. Have you been able to do it so far
15:53
to select the table? So, so command shift down or control
15:58
shift down, control shift right or command shift right to select the whole
16:03
table from a syntax perspective. And look,
16:08
everything in Excel is logical, right? It tells you what it needs to do and you
16:12
can tell it what you want what you want it to do.
16:16
with VLOOKUP, you're telling it, I want you to look for something which is the
16:20
lookup value in this table and give me back what I tell you to give
16:28
it back. In this case, you'll see here column index number, right? So, we're
16:33
going to do a comma before you move on to any else. So, comma or semicolon. So,
16:40
let's put a comma here. Do you see this in the back? It's fine. Okay.
16:47
So now you're at column index number. What's a column index number? Column
16:52
index number is which column do you want to give back?
17:00
Okay. So this column index number is supposed
17:05
to be a number. So you're supposed to say column 1, column 2, column 3. And
17:10
we'll look into more complex ways to do this as well so that you reduce errors.
17:14
But in the meantime, because I'm looking for a supplier name, I need to put my
17:20
column index as as what? What's the number that I need
17:25
to put? Okay.
17:30
Did you Yes. The third element of a VLOOKUP is for
17:36
you to tell it which column it needs to look in to give you back the data that
17:42
you're requesting. And the the first thing we did is we told it what do I
17:47
look for? The second thing is where does it look? The third thing is where's the
17:52
output? In this case, I want supplier name. All right. So which column
18:00
is this in terms of the table? Sorry.
18:06
Three. B.
18:07
B. Okay. The way that the column index works is you have to give it a number.
18:11
So 1 2 3 4 two. Okay. Anybody has other answers or the same answer?
18:20
So this is the table array that we chose,
18:23
right? With the table array to give it the column index number, you have to
18:28
count how many columns there are. starting from the first one being one.
18:33
So the first column is always number one. So if I wanted to give me back
18:37
something from column one, I would put one. In this case, that's not what I
18:42
want. I want it to give me something from the second column, column two. So I
18:49
put two. Okay. Something to note about VLOOKUP is that
18:56
when you put the table array or when you select the table array, you see here we
19:00
selected suppliers, your first column, bless your first
19:05
column is where you need to uh have that unique ID that we talked about. So if
19:11
the lookup value was the product ID, your first column in a VLOOKUP has to be
19:16
the product ID. Okay? Okay, VLOOKUP will always look
19:21
from the first column of a table. So now let's put So we put a comma
19:28
already and let's put the number two because we want supplier name.
19:33
Okay, so let's put the number two and comma. The last thing that we can do and
19:40
this is not um mandatory but it's good to know.
19:46
False means that it's an exact match means find me P00001
19:52
and give me the supplier name for P 001. A true match or an approximate match,
19:59
what it'll do is it's useful more for numbers. So when you're looking through
20:05
let's say total revenue and you want the first instance of you know when
20:11
something shows or you want anything that is less than 100 you could put a
20:16
true match so it's an approximate match so it'll
20:20
take anything that's less than what you're looking for currently it's not as
20:25
relevant to what we're studying however it's you know a good to have for now I'm
20:30
going to put false which is what we will usually usually do for most of these.
20:35
Okay, so let's put false and close the parenthesis.
20:41
Has anyone not been able to get to here so far? Yes.
20:51
Something wrong with the formula? Okay. Is it equal vookup?
20:56
Does it look similar to this? Okay. I'll I'll come to you in a minute.
21:02
So for those who are able to do it, let's press enter.
21:09
Okay. So now what happened?
21:20
Something weird happened, right? Yes. Okay.
21:27
I'll go around in a minute to look at You hit spill. You have have a spill
21:34
error. Do you have anything in the table already?
21:39
Yes. Okay, I'll finish this point and then
21:43
I'm going to go around and help you guys out. So, what happens here in
21:50
the VLOOKUP? Can anyone tell me? Let's do a quick check.
21:56
Okay. Let's look at
22:15
this is global trends P 006. Okay. So what happens here?
22:28
Can anyone tell me in this formula based on what we briefly talked about last
22:34
time here?
22:40
If you can read the range, it says A1 to D11,
22:48
right? Okay. in this instance because my orders
22:52
and my suppliers are are in order. Actually, nothing really an error didn't
22:59
occur. But something wrong happened here with us.
23:03
If you scroll down to each of your each of your cells,
23:09
what do you see is happening to the range?
23:15
Okay, again, just look at this. This is changing, right?
23:21
Okay. So, what do you think is wrong with with this? What mistake did we make
23:28
when we were trying to put our lookup table?
23:33
We didn't lock it. Exactly. So, we didn't lock this table. And so, what
23:38
ended up happening is the table kept bouncing down, down, down, down, down.
23:44
Right. Because it's going down. So we're going to look at what absolute
23:50
referencing and relative referencing is now because it's quite important to
23:55
understand right with this that we need to lock our tables especially that we
24:02
did not set this as a table and I don't want to
24:06
set it as a table now because I want to look at absolute referencing if it was
24:11
set as a table which means we did insert table you won't have to do the the
24:16
referencing, but it's still important to know as a skill. Okay.
24:23
So, um I'm just going to go around and make sure that you you guys figured out
24:28
the VLOOKUP and help whoever needs help and we can do it. We'll come tell me
29:34
Can you hear me now? Excellent. So, if no one has any more questions
29:38
about XLOOKUP and we'll we'll do a revision at the end of the class as
29:41
well. Then let's look at the mistake that we
29:47
were that we were doing. Ali, you guys are ready? Yeah.
29:54
Okay. Now, what happened when we dragged a
29:59
formula down? What did we see? H when we dragged the
30:07
formula down or it was in a table,
30:13
the reference started to jump. Right? I was in A1, then I went to A2, A3, A4.
30:20
When you drag something down, especially a range, Excel will give you the
30:26
relative position of it relative to the original, which means yes.
30:31
Oh, sorry. Uh, what's the benefit of us doing the lookup instead of just copy
30:37
and pasting the row? Great question. Very, very good
30:41
question. In this exercise, we had P 01 to 10. Your table lookup had P 0 1 to
30:48
10. In reality, that's not really the case. Why? Because you're going to have
30:55
different ranges that are in different orders and you're looking at orders.
31:00
Let's say here we had 10 orders. You can have up to, I don't know, 500, a,000,
31:08
10,000 orders. And you need to get the supplier name for each of these orders.
31:12
So you have let's say one table that's P 0001 to 10, but then you have 500
31:17
orders. If you copy paste each one, first of all, it's going to take you a
31:22
lot of time and it's going to have a lot of mistakes. The second thing is that if
31:27
you have all of these, let's say order names and that they're not in order
31:32
either, then it's also hard to map one to one.
31:35
Can remind me of your name. Sami. Sami
31:39
Sam Sam asked a really good question
31:43
and maybe you can also let's see who was also paying attention now. Sam asked why
31:48
can't we just copy paste the formulas or sorry the data from the table of
31:54
supplier name into the order data or the order table. Okay. So what do we think
32:00
the answer is? Because information can change.
32:04
The information can change because this is a specific situation
32:08
could do it. Yeah.
32:09
But in other situations probably not going to be as sorted as this.
32:13
Exactly. Anybody else? This is a really really excellent point
32:18
and the reason why we're doing lookups from the beginning. We start simple but
32:24
it becomes much more complicated later and I will show you as well
32:30
confidentially something I do in my own work and how I
32:34
use lookup functions but it's you know numbers that are really confusing I have
32:39
customer IDs that are 10 numbers long numbers and letters and I can't really
32:45
differentiate each one so I use lookup functions to identify let's say who
32:49
received how many how much and tips Okay,
32:53
so we were looking at that VLOOKUP and we dragged it down and you saw it
32:58
started to jump. When you have a lookup table, this
33:03
jumping will cause you a lot of issues because
33:06
let's say you jump below the table, then now you're asking Excel to look for you
33:12
in somewhere empty, right? So why do you think that we use
33:20
absolute referencing? Why do you think this is useful
33:25
to do something like absolute referencing which means to fix something
33:32
in one place? Anyone?
33:39
Which which scenarios do you think this would be useful?
33:44
So one scenario where locking or having absolute referencing is useful is in
33:50
lookup functions when you have a small table that you want to apply to a bigger
33:55
data set. How does locking or absolute referencing work? We touched upon it
34:00
slightly last time. The dollar sign before each of the
34:05
elements of row and column means freeze. So, dollar A means freeze the column or
34:14
row. You know it column or row. If dollar A
34:22
is freeze the column. Exactly.
34:27
Dollar one means freeze the row. So, dollar A dollar one means freeze my
34:35
reference to this cell in its place. Even if I drag the formula, don't change
34:40
the reference of this cell. You can also do something called mixed
34:47
uh mixed referencing. Okay,
34:52
does anyone know of a scenario where you could use mixed referencing?
34:58
Can think about it. So a mixed reference can be quite
35:03
helpful when you are trying to look up from quite a big table but you
35:13
have one place let's say or one value that is set so let's say the product ID
35:21
but you want it to be able to jump from column to column
35:26
all right so let's say that you want to look you're creating a table for a
35:31
certain product ID and the tables are let's say two rows but you always wanted
35:36
to look for product ID. So you could freeze the row so that it's always
35:40
remains on product ID but then whatever column you drag it to it will still only
35:47
look at the product ID but it'll look at different columns right and we'll do an
35:50
example of this as well because it's quite difficult to do on
35:54
in a theoretical way. So now let's go back to our exercise here.
36:01
And to look again at A1 to D1. Do you think we need to do absolute
36:08
referencing or mixed referencing in this case?
36:13
Absolute. Both would work. Okay.
36:22
All right. In this case, because we might drag this to somewhere different,
36:28
it's better to put absolute referencing because I want the table to remain in
36:32
its place. Mixed referencing is usually used in a
36:37
slightly different situation where you're looking at not lookup value
36:42
specifically, but you want something to drag across a bigger table.
36:50
It's hard to explain in theoretical, but we'll do an example of it. All right.
36:53
So, in this case, we're we want to do absolute referencing. Now, different
36:56
ways to do this. I could manually put dollar sign in front of each one, but it
37:02
will take me a little bit of time, right? I can put dollar here and go to
37:06
one and put dollar here. Or as I taught you last time, you can do you can press
37:11
F4 or Fn F4. Fn is on your bottom left of your keyboard.
37:20
So you'll see this FN and F4. All right. Were you able to find Fn F4? Can you try
37:28
it? So if you have a fin lock, you just
37:33
press F4. If you don't have fin lock, press hold down Fn and then press F4.
37:39
This is called the toggle, right? It toggles the absolute and and relative
37:45
referencing. So it'll give you first the absolute reference. If I press it
37:51
again, it'll give you uh mixed reference with the row in place. If I press again,
37:57
it'll give you the column in place. All right. And if I press a fourth time, it
38:03
will remove all of the absolute referencing.
38:08
Okay. Where are you able to find? F4. All right. So I pressed F4 but again
38:18
only one of them was able to be highlighted.
38:22
Okay, I want both of them to be highlighted. So there's two ways to do
38:26
this. Either I go now press on my cursor, press on D11 and again press F4
38:34
or if I select both of them together like this, as long as I'm touching
38:39
either one in the range and I press F4, it'll apply to both.
38:44
Okay? So make sure that you apply the absolute referencing to both the first
38:50
part of the range and the last part of the range. So if I press okay
38:59
my table when I go down you'll see the reference doesn't move.
39:08
Yes questions.
39:13
Yeah. Need help with it? Okay.
39:22
So, let's look at the next instruction, please.
39:47
It's a bit hard to see from here. So
39:58
the next thing we want to do is we want to use an XLOOKUP function.
40:04
Older Excel does not have XLOOKUP. Okay, as I said, it is a newer version of it.
40:11
For those who are not able to do XLOOKUP, I would like you to use VLOOKUP
40:16
again and make sure that you can understand both. So, you can use VLOOKUP
40:21
again. All right. X lookup is a more robust way to look at uh lookups without
40:30
having to count the number of columns and it is agnostic of whether it is
40:35
horizontal or vertical. So now let's do the XLOOKUP function
40:45
for the cost per unit. Again, you see here, going back to the
40:51
suppliers table, that cost per unit is here, right? It's in
40:57
the fourth column. But instead of doing it where I'm
41:01
counting the number of columns, I'm going to do it as such. How does X
41:05
lookup work? We're going to do equal XOOKUP.
41:13
And it has a similar syntax. The syntax for e xookup is again lookup
41:28
value. What am I looking for in this case? Right. What am I looking for? What
41:35
is my unique identifier that I'm going to choose?
41:39
Product ID. Yes. Is there anything else that would work?
41:44
Order. Supplier name. Yeah. Yes.
41:47
Revenue. Which one?
41:49
Revenue. Revenue. Is revenue unique enough to be
41:53
our lookup value? Revenue. You think that? So revenue
42:00
could be okay. I mean it might but if you see here
42:09
your lookup value has to be unique. So for for all of them
42:14
just unique value. It has to be a value that can be identified in a unique way.
42:21
So product Yeah, exactly. Product ID. But his question was why can't revenue
42:26
be used as a lookup value? If you use revenue as lookup value, right, then the
42:30
600 here, first of all, in the other table, we don't have revenue, right? So
42:35
there's no overlap. The second thing is that it's not unique.
42:41
Okay? So xookup is we can use either one.
42:46
We're going to use product ID in this case. So my lookup value is this cell.
42:55
Again do not choose the whole table or the whole column. Just choose one cell.
43:03
Okay. So that's what we are looking for. The second thing for XLOOKUP is lookup
43:08
array. Where is the lookup array? Lookup array
43:13
means I need to find P001 somewhere
43:21
suppliers. Exactly. So we'll go to suppliers
43:28
here. Okay. Now with with XLOOKUP all you need to do or all you need to give
43:34
it as a lookup array is to give it the column or the row of where you want it
43:40
to look. Cost per unit is what you want it to
43:45
give you, right? Where do you want it to look? We gave it
43:51
first. Lookup value is P 001. I want you to find P001 somewhere.
43:59
P2. I want it to look here. Okay. So I'm
44:08
going to select product ID
44:12
to here. Is that clear with XLOOKUP? If you can
44:19
figure this part out, the rest is easy. Okay.
44:24
Lookup product ID in this column. So let's select column one.
44:33
Okay. What do we do before we press comma or semicolon
44:39
or we move to a different sheet?
44:44
What should we do here before we move on? absolute reference to
44:51
exactly now before if you haven't pressed
44:57
the comma or the semicolon and you press Fn F4 once it'll
45:04
uh reference the entire range. If you have pressed the comma and want to go
45:09
back you have to select both of these and then press Fn F4.
45:16
Yeah. So while you press Fn, press F4. Yes, even the old the old one, it's
45:24
still the same. Okay, now we put comma or semicolon if you have different
45:30
syntax. Okay,
45:33
that's dollar sign just to reface across like sections, right?
45:37
The the dollar sign is so what Excel does is when you drag something down,
45:42
if it's referencing here, let's say when you drag it down, it'll drag the
45:46
reference with it. We are doing the other side,
45:50
right? But we referencing this is just referencing the other.
45:57
Yeah, it's just referencing where to look.
46:00
So you don't need Okay.
46:04
you're referencing only this range supplier.
46:10
in the in the supplier sheet. Okay.
46:13
I've selected only one column. Okay. That's why we use
46:18
Yes. Okay.
46:21
The second element of this or technically the third is return array.
46:27
So what is what is the return array in this case?
46:31
Should should I go back to the order sheet here? Should I stay on the
46:35
suppliers column? What do you want?
46:42
The question is what is the cost per unit
46:46
for for each product? Okay.
46:55
D column. Excellent.
46:58
Anyone else knows the answer? What is my return array? Maybe in the
47:05
back. What is my return array in my XLOOKUP?
47:11
Uh in my XLOOKUP uh formula, what should I select?
47:17
I want them to answer. Yes, four is in VLOOKUP, right? Four is
47:23
column index. So, but it's I'm really glad that you raised this, right? The
47:28
return array with an XLOOKUP is the range as to which you wanted to look
47:33
for. In the first place, we didn't select this entire table. We selected
47:37
only one column. Which means if I want the cost per unit, I need to select this
47:44
column. So I need to select D.
47:48
Okay. So I'm going to select D here
47:56
and I'll select this. Why instead of selecting the entire row column
48:03
you just hit comma D? You can you can select the entire column
48:10
D and the entire column A. The problem is that when you have bigger data sets,
48:16
this will slow down your Excel a lot and can cause uh can cause it to freeze.
48:21
Okay. So when we were in um I used to work for government a while
48:29
back and we used to do a lot of national initiatives. So we used to do a lot of
48:34
analyses for national initiatives meaning like if we did a new policy on
48:39
education how will that impact the student force in a certain GCC country
48:46
or if you do um let's say you implement a a type of subsidy how will that impact
48:52
right you're talking about populations of millions and millions of people we
48:57
had all of their data so it was maybe so some we even used like SQL and and
49:03
other things. But for Excel, right, for let's say the smaller data sets, it was
49:07
still around like 500,000 rows and around I want to say 50 to 60 columns.
49:14
Okay, when we did it to that big extent, when
49:19
we select the entire column, it just makes everything a lot slower. For the
49:24
purposes of these, you can use then you don't need absolute referencing. You
49:27
don't need like any of these other stuff. But I want to teach you the
49:31
basics and then you can decide how to implement them afterwards. Okay.
49:36
So again we chose suppliers D1 to D11 and we should do absolute referencing.
49:44
So again Fn and F4 okay
49:54
clear? Clear so far. Now, something I didn't mention before, but I alluded to
50:01
many, many times. I know in the back you can't see this a lot, but if not, just
50:05
look at your laptop screens. The elements in any formula that are
50:11
within brackets are optional. I know it doesn't show here, so you can
50:19
look at it from your laptop. Any element that is in brackets. Okay.
50:27
are um not optional
50:35
are optional. Sorry. Okay.
50:45
So, there's three things that XLOOKUP will give you that are optional. If not
50:49
found, match mode, and search mode.
50:55
If not found is an embedded function within the XLOOKUP that allows for error
51:02
tracking and error fixing. If not found, it means that if you don't find this
51:07
specific thing, this specific thing that you're looking for, you can give it a if
51:12
not found default value. So you can say not found, you can say not available,
51:19
you can basically put anything instead of having that error, right? No one
51:24
likes to see errors across their Excel. So if not found is a way to embed error
51:30
uh formulas and and we'll do this maybe towards the end.
51:35
Match mode. So column if not found column match
51:42
mode. Match mode also has a lot of elements and we don't have time to go
51:48
into all of them but it's it's a really cool function. Okay, exact match is
51:55
like the false in the VLOOKUP. So zero can be for exact match. Exact match or
52:02
next smaller item, exact match your next larger item. If you put minus one and
52:06
plus one, this is mostly for numerical data, right? So if it finds let's say P
52:13
003, it'll give you or let's say P002, it'll give you 250, right?
52:20
Usually the data has to be sorted in ascending order or for a minus one has
52:24
to be sorted in descending order. Unfortunately, we don't have time to go
52:28
into all of the all of the details. However, it's just
52:33
something for you if you're interested to learn more about it than then you
52:37
can. In this case, it's going to be an exact match.
52:41
Search for exact match if not found returns na. Right? So, it returns an
52:46
error. Again, we don't have to put this, right? It's optional, but you can put it
52:52
if you want to. So, I won't fault you if you don't put
52:56
it. I'm going to put zero here for all intents and purposes.
53:01
Then, it can do search mode. So, it can search first to last, last to first,
53:05
which means that it's agnostic of any sorting.
53:10
Okay? And so, especially this is useful for non-unique elements. Okay? But
53:17
again, I won't go into that a lot. So, I'm going to close my parenthesis. Now,
53:22
you could close your parenthesis if you wanted to. From here, after I gave it
53:27
the return one, I can close my parenthesis and move on.
53:32
Okay. But we'll do the error tracking afterwards. At least that one. So, I'm
53:36
going to press okay. Going to zoom out a bit.
53:42
Okay. So, I'll press okay. Did everyone press enter?
53:47
Yes. Okay. And now you have XOOKUP of the
53:51
cost per unit. Okay. Anybody needs help with XOOKUP?
54:00
Yeah. Okay, moving on.
59:03
Yeah. Okay. Let let me let me just put the
59:08
next the next thing on and then we can we can uh go back to questions. Okay.
59:14
Especially that we don't have a lot of time left.
59:19
Okay, we're going to do a final lookup and I'll I'll come back to you with with
59:24
the questions. So now we've done VLOOKUP for those with
59:29
the newer Excel guys. Sorry, we're just starting again.
59:32
Okay, we did VLOOKUP, we did XLOOKUP. Now we
59:38
want to use something called index match and we want to learn about some formulas
59:43
that are useful. Ali mentioned them at the beginning of the class which are
59:47
things like max, min, large, small and these are ways for us to identify you
59:53
know the highest value product or something that has uh let's say the
59:58
smallest um three or the last three products that we have in terms of
1:00:03
revenue. Okay. So as a setup what we're going to do first is we're going to
1:00:08
calculate total cost and profit in the order sheet.
1:00:13
Okay, so total cost right since we have the cost per unit and we have the unit p
1:00:21
the unit sold how do we calculate cost total cost
1:00:33
times which which column this one
1:00:40
this this one or this one
1:00:47
D2 okay so we'll do that okay so let's
1:00:53
calculate total cost total cost is so in our table let's do total cost
1:01:05
we we got the cost per unit now we need to get total cost the we
1:01:10
have the number of units sold. So we have total cost. If you remember from
1:01:17
session one, right, our table or when we inserted a table, it was easier for us
1:01:24
to calculate everything directly. Otherwise, we would be dragging every
1:01:28
formula and would have to uh look if we need absolute or relative referencing.
1:01:33
Okay. Now profit is what?
1:01:44
total cost. Okay, total cost we have we used our X
1:01:49
lookup right to find cost per unit correct and you have total units sold.
1:01:56
Okay, so to get total cost we have to get cost
1:02:02
per unit times units. Okay.
1:02:05
Okay. So just when you put equal this cell times that cell and you know that
1:02:11
times is star I don't know if if I've mentioned this
1:02:17
before I mentioned it briefly in session two that multiplication addition
1:02:21
division these are all standard formulas right
1:02:27
we know that multiplication is the star does anyone not know this
1:02:33
or is it fine Okay. So now we have total cost. So how do we
1:02:39
calculate total profit? Excellent. So we'll put equal
1:02:48
revenue minus total cost
1:02:54
and we get here revenue. Okay.
1:02:59
So now we have this and we have all of our profits.
1:03:07
All right. Now, which one has the highest profit?
1:03:15
The first one. Okay. And what's the lowest profit?
1:03:22
Second one. What is the lowest profit in this table?
1:03:28
the second one. Okay.
1:03:32
What's the What's the order ID for for this one?
1:03:42
Okay. One 02 is the order number. Okay.
1:03:48
How did you find that? How did you find the order number?
1:03:53
Did you scrolled back, right? Yeah. and you looked at it and you found
1:03:57
it and you're like 100 is the smallest one and this is the corresponding order
1:04:02
ID. So an easier way to do this is with a
1:04:07
lookup function and the easier way to identify the top and the bottom are
1:04:13
using things like max min and small
1:04:19
and large. Okay. Now
1:04:26
we're going to look at something simple here.
1:04:34
Maxmin will look at a range and tell you what
1:04:38
is the highest number in that range. Min will give you the lowest number in that
1:04:44
range. Okay, this is very straightforward. Small
1:04:50
large will give you the nth smallest or largest value in a range. Give me the
1:04:59
third lowest value for total revenue. Give me the fifth highest value in
1:05:04
revenue. What you do is you would select that
1:05:08
range and then tell it what rank you want it to give you. So I want you to
1:05:14
give me first, second, and third. Okay? So I'll put one, two, and three.
1:05:19
That's small and large. Round
1:05:25
as it says rounds values to the n decimal places. I want you to round this
1:05:29
to two decimal places to three. You can also do something called round up and
1:05:33
round down. But honestly, with the different uh formatting that you can
1:05:39
put, it's not really as relevant. Sometimes it is, especially if you're
1:05:43
doing an HR headcount. You're trying to forecast how many people you need to
1:05:49
hire for your business, right? As per which is demand driven. So
1:05:54
imagine I put I need 2.675 human beings, right? Thank you.
1:06:02
So, so you would round up or you would round
1:06:06
down. In this case, you would round up. Okay.
1:06:11
The last thing which I think is very important and this is something that I
1:06:14
will teach you as well with the index match is if error. An if error is a way
1:06:20
for you to highlight something that is um wrong. So let's say VLOOKUP.
1:06:30
For example, if there's some type of error with the VLOOKUP,
1:06:34
you can put an if error so that instead of it showing a lot of you had these
1:06:40
errors hashtag name hash NA, right? It will show any type of value that you set
1:06:46
for it. All right. So, we're going to do these two things
1:06:53
now. First, we're going to determine the top
1:07:00
three revenues in the data set, right? So, forget the highest and lowest
1:07:06
just for the sake of time. Okay? So, I want you to go to your order
1:07:11
sheet here, and we're going to do a small
1:07:17
table here on the side, and we're going to call it, let's say, top three
1:07:23
revenue. Okay?
1:07:26
Now, I want you to put one, two, and three so that we can get
1:07:32
the top three revenue. And I'll tell you why I want to do it this way. because I
1:07:36
could just put in my formula, you know, large one, large two, but I
1:07:42
don't like to hardcode anything. Never hardcode any values. Hard- coding means
1:07:46
putting a specific number in a formula because that means that you can't change
1:07:50
it and you can't um drag it down. So, to get the top revenue for top
1:07:56
three, we're going to use something called the large formula.
1:08:02
Okay, only two things are needed here. array which is the range and k is the
1:08:08
kth value of what level you want the formula to give you back as in I want
1:08:16
the second largest the third largest the fifth largest okay so what if I want to
1:08:21
get the top three revenue which array should I choose
1:08:27
I okay that's one option what else can I choose
1:08:33
F. Exactly. So, I'm going to choose F.
1:08:39
Okay. Because it's a table, you don't need to do absolute referencing,
1:08:43
but you just select this range. Then, comma or
1:08:52
comma or semicolon K. Right? I want the top one revenue in my
1:08:59
data set. Top one. So what should I put here in terms of K?
1:09:06
One three.
1:09:10
Yes. So I have two options, right? Both of
1:09:14
you are correct. I could put one and I could close it. But then I actually
1:09:19
wanted the top three, right? Sorry. Can someone from the back just
1:09:27
close the the door there? all three.
1:09:32
It can be. No. So, it has to be one at a time. But because I don't like to hard
1:09:36
code anything, which means I don't like to put numbers in my formulas, I'm going
1:09:41
to reference M3, right? So, like Diego said, we
1:09:46
reference M3. Do we want to add an absolute reference
1:09:50
here? Yes or no? No. Anyone else?
1:09:58
So, Ali's right. We don't want an absolute reference.
1:10:02
Why? Because I want to drag this down to here, right? Or I can copy this. When
1:10:11
I copied it, I do want two. Okay? You see it referenced two because I want the
1:10:17
second highest. Same for the third thing,
1:10:24
the third highest. So now I have my top three revenue.
1:10:32
Were you able to do it with me? So now we have the top three revenue.
1:10:46
Now typically I don't like to use an index match for things like revenue but
1:10:51
we will have to. Yeah, but for the purpose of this
1:10:59
exercise, we're going to use it. Okay, index match is the same as xookup,
1:11:04
vookup. It's just another way to get a this type of lookup function.
1:11:11
Okay, so for those with the older Excel, index match will work. So if you don't
1:11:17
want to use VLOOKUP, you can use index match.
1:11:21
All right, so we're going to put index here.
1:11:31
All right. So, we're going to put equal index. The first thing we will do is we
1:11:35
will select the table. We will select where we want it to look
1:11:44
in this case. Yes, we can select the whole table.
1:11:52
the whole table. You can you don't have to select the
1:11:54
whole table in this case, but let's say if we want to look for other things, it
1:11:59
just makes more sense because then you can just drag it everywhere. Okay,
1:12:02
again, we don't need to reference absolute reference because it's a table.
1:12:07
Okay, then we're going to match.
1:12:12
Now again index match the functionality of it is set a table
1:12:20
match me with a row number match me with a column number give me the
1:12:24
intersection. Okay so row column intersection.
1:12:29
So what you do with an index match is you index the entire table first then
1:12:34
you give it which row number you want then you give it which column number you
1:12:37
want. Instead of telling it I want row number six, column number seven,
1:12:45
what you'll do is you will do a match function. Okay, match the output of a
1:12:51
match function is a number. When you match a column here, okay, so let's say
1:12:58
I put total cost, find me total cost in this row, it will give you column number
1:13:03
eight. If you put give me in in this case let's say with revenue find me
1:13:10
1,200. Okay, this is column number 10 or sorry, row number 10, right? So it'll
1:13:18
give me row number 10 and column number eight and then it will give me this if I
1:13:21
want to. Okay, so with match
1:13:29
the first thing I want to do is I want to have lookup value match within index.
1:13:35
Right? So you'll see row number row number.
1:13:40
So I want you to match 1,400,
1:13:48
right? Because I want to find what I'm trying to find is in this case,
1:13:55
right? Oh my goodness.
1:14:02
The instruction is to find the product category corresponding to the product
1:14:06
with the highest revenue. Right? Right. So I need to find product categories.
1:14:11
So equal index here much
1:14:18
I want400 in
1:14:22
lookup array. So the lookup array is I need you to find me 1400 within the
1:14:27
revenue column because that will give me the row.
1:14:35
Okay. The match type we'll put as as an exact
1:14:43
match. So we'll put zero. Okay.
1:14:51
The second thing that I want to match is the product category.
1:14:56
So we'll do match for now. We'll put it as hardcoded.
1:15:04
So you put to put anything in text you have to put quotation marks right same
1:15:09
as like with that's what I want to show you now. So I
1:15:15
need you to find product category right in this specific row
1:15:23
here. So put comma
1:15:28
here in the headers and then match type is
1:15:35
zero. Okay,
1:15:42
we're going to we're going to maybe do this again next
1:15:49
time. Uh I wanted this to be a much more
1:15:53
interactive session. Yes.
1:15:59
I got lost. Yeah.
1:16:02
So, we're we're we're going to do it again next next time. Um I think for now
1:16:08
we can uh do the cahoot quickly
1:16:15
because we only have five minutes left. But this is what we learned about
1:16:20
lookups, right? Lookups help you to automate,
1:16:24
helps you to reduce error. There's different types of lookups.
1:16:31
Join. Okay,
1:16:35
it's not working anymore. Okay.
1:17:07
So remember that with VLOOKUP, you tell it what you're
1:17:14
looking for and which column you're looking in. Okay, as a quick recap
1:17:18
before the cahoot. Okay,
1:17:23
we know that the index match will give you
1:17:32
exactly. So it'll it'll give you the intersection, right,
1:17:37
of column and row where a lookup value is X. It'll give you where it is in
1:17:43
column B. Okay? and give you the intersection.
1:17:50
Absolute versus relative referencing is important especially in formulas when
1:17:54
you're looking at ranges. Yes,
1:18:00
absolute means the row and the column start with dollar sign.
1:18:04
Mixed means uh only one of them has a dollar sign.
1:18:09
For example, no, just a dollar sign two is a mixed
1:18:21
reference. Why is it a mixed reference?
1:18:24
Because the A doesn't have a dollar sign on top of it.
1:18:28
A doesn't have a dollar sign. It doesn't have a dollar sign.
1:18:33
A2. What type is that?
1:18:37
It's It's just referencing in front of
1:18:40
Yes. Yes. Okay,
1:18:42
guys. I'm starting We're starting cahoot.
1:18:45
The last thing. The last thing that we didn't get to do
1:18:56
or we did very briefly is if error. And if error means that whatever is in
1:19:02
quotation marks will be shown if an error comes up.
1:19:04
Okay. three dots in the whole table or the whole
1:19:11
dots in the three dots.
1:19:15
Yeah. What's three dots?
1:19:29
I think it just didn't show. Okay,
1:19:33
let's do it quickly. Just run out of time.
1:20:04
right? It's the only one that makes sense.
1:20:09
Okay. Okay.
1:20:25
Are you doing your cahoots? Yes.
1:20:27
Are you sure? You know it's part of your grade, right?
1:20:33
You're not. Yes.
1:20:40
Okay. Let's go. Okay, so in index match is what we were
1:20:48
trying to do now. All right, it will basically return
1:20:54
the value from a column. Okay, we didn't get to do this. So it'll return a value
1:21:01
where uh from a certain column where value equal something X.
1:21:08
Okay. Okay, guys. Two more questions, please.
1:21:14
Which reference remains constant? Where's the music?
1:22:24
Good job. Okay. Thank you all.
