What is the first thing your customer can tell you about pricing?
08/09/2025 | 08:30 AM - 10:00 AM
Dr. Garima Chaklader
0:00 
No other members allowed. Okay. Okay. Rule number three.
0:07
Rule number three. If you speak over me or if you speak without my permission or
0:13
I find you speaking anything nonsense, I will throw you out
0:17
and I will throw you out of my class. No attendance. And then we you and I can
0:20
fight outside the class. That's okay. But not within the class. Perfect. I
0:24
like that. Okay. Awesome. Let's go forward. Why are you here in Tetto?
0:32
to build businesses. To build businesses, right? Where will
0:36
you sit? But is there a seat there? What's your name? Nicola.
0:50
Nicola. Okay. Okay. I like the fact that he's written his name on the juice and
0:54
then Sorry, a professor has a bad vision. Okay. You're here to learn
0:58
businesses. How do you set up? How do you go about making a business?
1:08
I will. But if you talk to him, you wouldn't know me. You wouldn't know what
1:11
I'm hearing or what I'm saying. Could you repeat the question for Ishi?
1:26
How do we go about? You said you're here to learn making businesses. How do you
1:30
go about it? What's your step one? Did he tell you that an idea is nothing
1:50
but a problem and a solution put together?
1:54
Right. Awesome. So you're here for having an idea or giving an
1:58
understanding to what an idea is. What is the problem? What is solution?
2:01
Awesome. Let's say we have an idea. Then what do you do? How do you go about
2:08
it? Let's say I found the right problem. I
2:12
found the solution. Here you go. Voila. I have an idea. What do you do?
2:17
Do you straight away go ahead into marketing?
2:22
You need to create the pricing, the execution, the strategy.
2:28
You already look at cheap products or substitutes or competition.
2:33
The substitutes or competition. What are the cheaper options?
2:45
Okay. Do you start away already making prototypes?
2:50
That sounds that's step three. Step four. What is more private
2:55
to check if it's profitable? Would you always have data to check for
2:59
its profitability? Then what do you do? Okay. Oh my god. There you go. The
3:09
second truck goes in. Do research. Go ask people.
3:18
Supply chain. I have so many jargon being thrown at me on my face back and
3:23
again by each and every one of you. How about I say that sometimes research
3:29
takes time. Sometimes computing profitability takes a lot of time
3:32
finding the right numbers. Sometimes setting up a supply chain is
3:37
far more difficult. You will start finding your own suppliers. It will take
3:41
some time. Somebody said marketing that's already money out of your pocket
3:45
going away. Right? Which means anytime as Gupes said, if I have a problem and a
3:50
solution, I have a culmination of an idea your professor of economics is
3:55
coming and telling you you can use common sense to break it down.
3:59
Sometimes without using Did you say common sense?
4:03
Did I do not hear you? I will break it down to you. How
4:09
prototype is step number three. Making a prototype would need some money already
4:14
going out. How do I not spend money? How do I not spend resources?
4:22
Okay, this is where you focus on the class now. And let's say we have a point
4:25
of difference. We'll take it up. Is that okay?
4:28
Let's say where is Isaac? You called me up last night. You remember?
4:34
Yes. At 11 p.m.
4:37
And do you know what Isaac was doing? He already has a business idea.
4:46
Generally a lot of students get up and say we don't have a we don't remember at
4:49
all. There is no memory at all. But folks, Isac came up with another
4:55
business idea apart from the one that he's working on drop shipping and his
4:59
co-founder is Nicholas and Isa get together and
5:06
there's the co-founder, right? And what do they do? They get on a Zoom call with
5:10
me at 11 p.m. last night and they were like, "You know what? We have this
5:13
business idea prop. We really think we need to work on it." And both of them
5:16
are very very motivated with these Thank you.
5:24
Cros, not in class quick, but cross, right? I was like, "Okay, fine. What do
5:29
you know about these cross?" No, no, I'm just making it up. He didn't.
5:34
Guys, he didn't. So, the guy who says, "Nice to meet
5:39
you," and the guy on top who in the front who did not say that, he doesn't
5:43
remember, he they came up to me and said, "You know what, professors? We
5:48
want to put up a chro cafe around and I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing the name
5:52
incorrectly but we want to start a croissant cafe around in myriad. I'm
5:56
like fine and they haven't done any research. They haven't done any data.
5:59
They don't have anything data or nothing. They just come to me and they
6:02
just studied the entire environment around me. I said okay what do you know?
6:07
Dubai's lively myriad is teeming with students surrounded by colleges and
6:12
fueled by an endless appetite for good food.
6:16
very simple English statement, but it's already telling me that they're staying
6:20
in Myriad. They're wanting to set up a business around Myriad. And at the same
6:25
time, they know that there is a huge population of colleges around them and
6:29
like-minded students nearby. Are you with me? So, do you see how the
6:34
demand data is being validated? Right? Maybe there are people around me. Can I
6:38
see if there's any demand or not? Line number two. These two are always
6:43
observing you all running for coffee runs here and there and all of you are
6:48
paying for very expensive lunch bowls also. Food is expensive around in period
6:55
and that's something these two have picked up. There are too many students
6:58
around that's something these two have picked up. You're running for your
7:01
coffee meals in the morning. Another problem statement they have picked up
7:05
and they both of them are very heavily trained in artal baking and they want to
7:11
bring in a little bit of Paris to Dubai. Is that okay? So you have two very
7:16
skilled resources here who know how to make this amazing croissant. At the same
7:21
time they're picking up problem statements of people around them. Do you
7:24
see how I'm coming with a problem and probably a solution? Okay.
7:29
Inspired by their time in France, they want to bring out the specialty of
7:34
heavenly crossover and everything in their cafe is made up with okay fresh
7:41
organic better butter, locally mil flour and no preservatives.
7:47
Are you with me? You want to say something about the
7:51
product? What do you think of the product?
7:57
Nicholas thinks it's great. Not only because it's his product, but why?
8:19
Do you want to use some more uh examples around in myriad and say why your
8:25
business may be better? Think think and that's open for all of
8:29
you. He's not the only one. You all are living in myriad right now. What can you
8:33
think of Carlo? The Wistro probably is my competitor.
8:38
What else? And Starbucks are probably my
8:41
competitor. They are overpriced
8:45
and now take information from the slide and
8:50
see why you may be better or worse when my BTO and when Starbucks are your
8:54
competitors. Do you understand what Nicholas is
9:07
saying? Also, your products have no preservatives. Starbucks is full of
9:12
preservatives. And at the same time, you are using locally mil flour. My bistro
9:17
may be using some very very cheap flour. So do you see how there is a P O D
9:23
already rather point of differentiation, right? So because of which because of
9:28
this this is the reason why they're already sourcing different ingredients
9:31
to separate themselves from the existing competition around. Are you with me?
9:36
Okay. Again guys till now this is just common sense. Till now still common
9:40
sense. However Isaac and Nicholas have decided that you
9:45
know what professor we operate on a simple rule. We are refusing to sell
9:52
leftovers the next day. In fact, all the goods are going to be sold within the
9:57
day. Are you with me? So, it's just fresh
10:01
food and whatever is there, they're not going to throw it the next day. They're
10:04
going to throw it away the next day or rather donate it to whosoever is needed
10:08
needing it. Right? So, now you have all the information over here. My question
10:13
to all of you is there is no real time data but there is a problem there is a
10:18
solution and I want all of you to evaluate the business idea. Exactly. The
10:23
first set of exercise that you will do in your drop shipping business and D2C
10:27
business, you will find a problem. You will find a solution in term one and
10:32
term two. But how do you go about evaluating it? Do you always prototype?
10:37
Do you always market or do you always do inventory management, supply chain
10:41
management? I have put together some real time information around you. That's
10:46
your life in myriad. Now go ahead and tell me do you think the business idea
10:50
is good or bad? Explain why is it good or bad?
10:57
It has a good POD. Why do you say so? What's the POD?
11:05
Yes. But what is it? Why do you think there is a POD?
11:11
So what Isaac means to say is that probably we are catering to healthy uh
11:15
students around us, right? Or health consscious students around us, right?
11:18
what Starbucks and why these two may not be able to do come.
11:23
Yeah. What he means to say very very clearly
11:35
is that I do not care where your food is coming from whether it's Africa, whether
11:39
it's south of Arabia, I really don't care. I'm hungry. I'm going to eat.
11:43
Which means the demand that I'm talking about in my the entire may not be the
11:49
right target market for you. Of course not.
11:55
So which means that already there is a portion of the population which is going
11:58
to visit my store. Not all of them. Right. Right. Right. Right. Now once you
12:03
know this, look at the last statement. She refuses to sell leftovers. And you
12:09
just told me in the class that of course I don't care about what food you're as
12:13
long as it's food I'm going to eat. So I'm not going to run after that health
12:16
consscious food. Do you think the leftovers may be a problem?
12:22
Can you see that that it's already a large amount of number of people are not
12:26
going to visit my store because of what camel thinks over here? As simple as
12:31
that. So which means for the entrepreneur leftover may become a big
12:34
problem. Then what do you think? How is the
12:37
business idea now? What do you think?
12:47
Okay, let me summarize what we have said. Number one, Isaac is saying that
12:51
there is a good pod. Correct? What do I mean by pod? It's
12:56
already I'm catering to health consscious students around me. Number
12:59
two, that the all the people may not be interested in my product. The leftover
13:05
may be an issue. What else can you think of the business idea here?
13:12
Sorry. You know what?
13:57
Okay. Okay, Nicholas, I'm coming. That's so clear. No, no, no. It's okay. I love
14:01
the fight. But you know what's happening? Clearly, there is a clear
14:04
market segmentation. I didn't even have to like teach it to
14:08
you folks. I just spotted and showed it to you. There's clearly segment of the
14:12
market. Clearly, there's another segment of the market and you are not my TG.
14:14
You're not my target group. I got to find people who are like me and Isaac
14:18
and Nicholas over here. Can you see that coming from beautiful conversations?
14:24
Okay, Nicholas, let me push you a little bit more because my job I understand
14:28
that you can see the problem over here on the leftovers and Nicholas is already
14:32
thinking of possible solutions to eliminate the problem. Let's not jump on
14:36
solutions. I'll come back to it shortly. Can you see more problems over here
14:41
Julian? That is inventory management. Okay,
14:50
fair. Can you see that? It's an extremely
15:04
expensive product. At the end of the day, I'm using
15:08
extremely expensive raw materials like organic butter, like
15:14
locally mil flour, and there are no preservatives, which means my goods
15:19
won't even last more than a day. What can you comment on profit margin over
15:24
here? Probably low. Did I give you any data?
15:29
Did I give you common sense? I just put together one, two, three,
15:38
four, five, five English statements. You guys are already talking about profit
15:43
margins. You guys are talking to me about leftovers and inventory management
15:47
across countries. Oh, you guys are talking to me about segmentation, target
15:53
group, and demand. For God's sake, can you understand that? Yes, your name. I
15:57
can't read it. I know you're Nicholas.
16:03
Moring go on they need to get
16:11
they need to get licensing. So because both of them are from the little Paris
16:15
and both of them have artsal baking experience and certificate. I'm thinking
16:19
getting that licensing won't be a problem for them but of course it could
16:23
be there but I'm thinking it's easier for both of them. Are you with me? Okay.
16:27
Question. What's your name?
16:40
So, Gara, for now, you're talking to me about raw materials. You're talking to
16:45
me about pricing and margins. But, Ghaima, you haven't even spoken to me
16:49
about the cost of transportation. You haven't spoken to me about the
16:53
logistics. You haven't spoken to me about the rent.
16:57
You're going to make me rent an entire store near Myriad. What about the
17:01
marketing expenses? Because you're going to make me compete with Starbucks.
17:05
Guys, I absolutely agree with Surange. There are so many costs that I'm not
17:10
discussing in the class right now. I am only talking to you about unit
17:16
economics. What do I mean by unit economics? Anybody any idea? Just a name
17:20
drop. What is unit economics? Thank you. That was exactly succinct and
17:28
exactly correct. Price, cost, margin. Done. That's your unit economics. Very
17:35
first question a shark asks you on the shock tank. Have you seen the shark or
17:41
the investor asking, "Hey, what is the rent of your store? Uh, do you see them?
17:46
How much money do you pay to gimmachl of business?" No, they never ask you
17:50
those questions. They will ask unit economics of what is the price of the
17:54
admissions, what is the price of the program fee, what was the cost of
17:57
acquiring that one student to deter one student. Unit economics or over here
18:04
what is the price of one cross? What is the cost of making one cross and what is
18:09
the profit on that one? Unit economics. Are you with me?
18:14
Which means these fixed costs or these large costs I will take into
18:19
consideration much later in my session four session five. I will make you do an
18:23
investor analysis whether you put in money in that business or not. But your
18:28
step one right now when you think of a business idea even in drop shipping is
18:33
going to be after unit economics. Are you with me?
18:37
Step number one find the idea. Alien.
18:44
Alien. On a scale of 1 to 10, at the risk of
18:48
putting myself publicly out there, am I that boring? The noise is sleeping.
18:54
Okay. How about we go out and wash our face and come back?
19:01
Okay. Are we following? Is the pace okay?
19:06
Are you understanding? Perfect. Okay,
19:11
you don't need to ask me. You can just go. That's completely okay. Okay.
19:15
Awesome. If we have done so much analysis without
19:19
data, can I present data in front of all of you? I don't appreciate Nicholas.
19:25
No talking in my class. One of my good students. Why is he behaving like that?
19:31
Had the key also. It's in your stomach. You might as well not speak for the next
19:34
45 minutes. Here you go. The cost of making one croisselling
19:41
price. Can you help me with the profit?
19:52
Selling price is $3. Cost is I'm sorry.
19:59
Profit. Profit is price minus cost. One for one.
20:04
This is actually per unit. per unit $3 and cost is $1.6. What's the
20:10
difference? I don't know how many of you watch Shark
20:15
Tank, but when you do, do you see this graph comes up on the TV? A circular
20:20
graph where number one, the price comes $3. Then they then they ask what's the
20:25
cost of goods sold? $1.4. And what's the last tangent?
20:31
The profit. They call it gross margin. They call it gross margin. How do they
20:37
calculate gross margin? Any idea? Anybody any idea how do they calculate
20:47
that gross margin? How does it Very simple. What does the jargon mean?
20:56
Gaimma, can you please find the profit? Sure.
21:00
Can you divide it by selling price? I'm like, why? Why? selling price and
21:06
then like it's so simple. I just want to know how much of that selling price have
21:11
I been able to keep in my pocket. That's all. If the price was $1, have I
21:18
been able to keep 70% in my pocket? Because that would be my profit
21:22
percentage. Are you with me? That is why I'm dividing it by profit. I'm dividing
21:27
it by price. With me? Okay. How much is the profit?
21:33
$1.4. $4. How much is the price? Can somebody do the math and tell me the
21:38
number here? Yeah.
21:59
Safe to say 47%. Are you with me? What do you think of
22:05
the 47%. Is it good? Is it bad?
22:14
It's good. Do you hear him? What's his name?
22:23
Adi. Arun. Do you hear Arin? Already I told
22:27
Suryan that I'm going to worry about the cost of employees, cost of rent much
22:31
later on. I haven't even deducted them and already without those costs I'm
22:36
having a margin of 47. Now tell me the number good or bad.
22:41
Generally in the food industry given my experience I have observed higher
22:46
margins of about 70 75%age which means 47%age probably is putting
22:53
us at some sort of a disadvantage. Fair easy till now just taking simple
22:59
English simple maths putting together concluding statements on a business okay
23:05
okay what's the next question would you expect a shark to ask on Shark Tank
23:12
how many sales do you have the very next question follow-up question is what are
23:17
the quarterly sales what are the monthly sales because even though the margin is
23:23
just comfortable 47% But if the volume was too large, a shark may end up
23:28
putting money in your business. So the shark doesn't stop at 47. He or
23:34
she or they have got a fair idea. But the very next follow-up question is how
23:37
many are you selling? Gha is it good to go? Because if you are then I put in
23:41
money and then we think stage number two. Here you go. Take some more data.
23:47
You are producing about 100 cross in that cafe.
23:53
Clear? That's your supply data.
23:58
And finally, every day you are tracking and you find about 70 people buying your
24:05
cross from the cafe. That's your demand data.
24:11
Ladies and gentlemen, what do you think of the business now? With a 47%age gross
24:17
margin or a $1.4 $4 profit per unit. What do you think is the profit of
24:23
Nicholas's and Isaac's business? Can I compute total profit?
24:30
How do I compute total profit? Give me an idea.
24:38
Which is $1.4 per unit.
24:46
No. into 70.
24:50
If you're selling 70, you make money out of 70 croissants.
24:55
No, that's the amount of that's for the
25:01
loss. I agree with you. That's for the loss. Leftover loss. Is it okay? How
25:05
much money he's able to make in right now just from selling cost is about $98.
25:13
But if he was actually successful in selling 100
25:17
He would have made about $140
25:22
already a $50. Of course, the numbers are too small. Now, you know, if I add
25:27
another zeros over here, it's about $5,000, $50,000 in a large scale setup.
25:32
Correct? Which means it's not working out.
25:36
Not working out. All of you are now my sorry, all of you are now my
25:41
consultants, right? Nicholas and Isaac have hired us.
25:46
And the problem statement is very clear to all of you. The profits are not
25:50
really in my favor. And the profits is what? It's just price minus cost per
25:55
unit. I'm running after unit economics. Price is about $3. Cost is about $1.6.
26:03
Give me some potential potential solutions to make it better.
26:09
Raise your hands. Raise your hands. I have Fatya over here. Go on.
26:14
Reduce cost of production. When can you truly reduce cost of production?
26:21
How do you increase efficiency? Again, jargon. Give me common sense. What is
26:26
economies of scale? Too many jarens. Increasing production. Do both of them
26:31
control production on raw materials? If they buy more units,
26:38
what is he saying over here? that gimma if I go and negotiate more with my
26:42
supplier and my supplier will say go you go buy more from me I'll give you more
26:46
profit that's what is coming to me at trying to decrease the cost of
26:52
production are you with me but my point to you is if we go if both of them you
26:56
advise them to buy more from the market look at the leftover data I'm already
27:01
wasting do I procure more raw materials which means I can't meddle with my costs
27:06
much at least on that economies of scale front Number one, do you agree where
27:11
you're making a mistake? Anything else? What's your name? Sam. Go on.
27:16
Increase the price. I'm with you, Sam. I'm with you. So,
27:20
what are these people doing in the class? They told me very simple. Profit
27:24
is my problem statement. This profit is nothing but dependent on
27:30
price and dependent on cost. So Rian concluded please go buy more so
27:37
that you can save more money. There is hardly any demand and if I buy more I
27:42
will lose more money. Right? How else can you reduce cost of production? Let's
27:47
talk a little more about cost and reduce daily production.
27:53
Okay. I'm talking about not total cost per product. Cost per cro.
27:59
Okay. So now think You anyway didn't want to eat the
28:06
healthy healthy. I know it. So over here, Kamill comes over here and
28:12
changes your business idea. No. No. Kish Kish Patton. No.
28:20
Okay. When you buy bulk, as what he said, you're already wasting food.
28:26
When you buy bulk, you'll have to produce more croissant. You're already
28:29
wasting here. So demand is not there Nan which means he has gone towards demand
28:39
data. He's not able to work towards cost side. Cost side is supply side. Right.
28:44
Not able to work it on last year. Okay. Not even talking about laborers
28:50
over here. Talking about raw materials cost here.
28:54
The production cost over here. Okay. When I say raw materials, I meant
28:59
butter, flour and preservative. Didn't even talk about the people who are
29:04
making it because it's a much later consideration.
29:09
Ah, reduce the size of changing the product.
29:12
Are you with me? The prototype according to Nicholas's language is being changed
29:17
with me. Which means, can you see that I'm not able to change the cost anymore?
29:22
Okay. Okay. So, as a consultant, you know that this is outside of my
29:26
jurisdiction because I'm not able to work it out. And then Sam comes in.
29:31
Sam makes a recommendation. Sam, Vimma, can you please increase the price?
29:36
Natalia, what do you think? Should I increase the price?
29:40
The unicorn that was flying in your dream, what did the unicorn say?
29:48
Natalia like, why are you doing that to me? Okay. Too too tired.
29:59
Are you not following me? Just hold on. Are you not following me?
30:06
Are you able to understand how we're going about evaluating business ideas?
30:09
Is it hitting your head? Are you sure?
30:16
Fine. Go on. Can we increase the price? Okay.
30:29
Starbucks. We can't compete against Starbucks. What
30:32
else? Carlo That makes a lot of sense. But I still
30:53
took Sam's recommendation and presented it as a consultant that can you please
30:59
increase the price because actually it's a very easy fix. And I love the fact
31:04
that all of you screamed at me at once, we are students, we can't increase the
31:09
price. And that's exactly what the founder also said. Shoppers bristle when
31:14
the cost of big goods passes beyond a certain threshold. And if you think that
31:19
in any capacity I am wasting your time, this is a statement right of the
31:25
economist article. I'm going to shortly share the article
31:30
with you. Entire case study has been there from somebody who's actually
31:34
trying to set the business in not Paris in some other country. I forgot where.
31:39
And then I found out okay you can't increase the price. What does marketing
31:43
say? A marketing prof will actually come and teach you psychological pricing.
31:50
Psychological pricing says when you work with products like crossoros which are
31:54
very regular you already have a limit in your head. Ah $3. Now I'm going to pay
32:01
more than $3.5. Do you hear me? So, how do you increase the price to $4 and $4.5
32:08
when customers are walking in with such solid numbers in their head with me?
32:15
Behavioral economics says the same thing in different language calling it
32:20
reference price effect. Just like how marketing people say there is a limit,
32:25
an economist says we have a reference price. $3 is okay, $4 is not okay.
32:32
which means price goes for a toss. I can't have price as a normal fix. Then
32:37
what do I do? How do I improve the margins? It all completely fails. Then
32:42
how can Isaac improve the model? Now we can go back to Nicholas's point.
32:47
Do you have more solutions coming up? Pricing goes out. I can't help with
32:51
pricing. How can you save your business now?
32:54
They are dark kitchen. That makes sense. Reduce
33:00
the rent cost. I just loan kitchens. What else?
33:11
So you do cut back on the cost of production. Is that the only thing out?
33:17
When you do change the cost of production, you completely change the
33:20
prototype. Okay. Think more. I'm pushing you more.
33:33
Okay. Why are you GAMA only looking at offline modes of communication? Can I
33:37
also see at online modes? Okay. What else? Expensive, but okay. What else?
33:46
Did you see? I'm not even talking to you about stuff.
33:50
It was only raw materials. So, it was actually So, we fire Isaac.
33:56
No. What else?
34:08
Thank you very much what you have done all this while I was talking to you
34:13
about demand demand demand demand demand and finally you've been able to find the
34:17
word of economics called supply ga can you finally see if you should be
34:23
producing 100 can I use can I track data can I see what's happening on a Monday,
34:29
what's happening on a Tuesday, what's happening on a wetness day and decide
34:32
how much to produce. Why are you producing 100 every day? Are you with
34:36
me? This inventory management is nothing but a demand supply mapping. Nothing
34:42
else. Yes. At the same time, you don't control for
34:55
inventory at all. In drop shipping, you don't control inventory at all.
35:01
Correct. What else? Why are you just focus on cross?
35:06
Can I focus on complimentary goods? Did you not discuss in bupious?
35:16
There you go. You start. But this is known as bundling pricing. What does it
35:21
mean? that I only not only look at cross but start looking at high margin
35:26
products. Are you with me? How I'm using again not just demand but margins also
35:31
to understand if I can package it with high margin products. A 47 percentage
35:36
poor crossoff product can be paired up with an 80% coffee product. Sure. Okay.
35:43
This is nothing but diversifying the product range. What else? What can I do?
35:48
Can I finally see that? You know what Gimma please stop wasting because you
35:52
know what I'm tracking my daily sales I see that students on Wednesday students
35:58
on Saturday and Sundays are enjoying their parties
36:02
because that's the only time you can chill that's the only time you go all
36:05
out with eating nice food and chilling and so on and so forth therefore ga they
36:10
don't come to my store on Mondays and Tuesdays
36:13
they eat clean they eat clean food they don't eat crossos and rich coffees and
36:18
stuff like that which just means Means I change my supply on Monday and Tuesday.
36:23
I randomly don't change my numbers. I actively track demand and supply. Are
36:28
you with me? How else do you think your business will perform in different uh
36:33
festivals? Okay. So if it's Christmas, what will
36:39
happen? Or what if students go back home in
36:45
Christmas for home? And if that happens and if that happens
36:51
you don't produce but at the same time if you were positioned in the middle of
36:54
Dubai Christmas you will produce more which means I can't have random
36:59
hypothesis in my head that you know what Christmas would mean more sales people
37:04
it depends on the location at academic city you won't have high sales I'm
37:08
continuously pushing you to think of more variables after variables to better
37:13
elicit proper supply and better elicit proper demand.
37:17
Are you with me? The first 45 minutes of my classroom. Take your phones out. Scan
37:24
the QR code. What do you find out?
37:50
What do you see people crosso economics
37:57
going forward you will find a business idea and write an article worth 30% of
38:05
your evaluation criteria. I'm expecting these monkeys to go back
38:11
and sit. I'll speak. Guys, it's okay. Go back. Go back. Sit
38:17
down. It's okay. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
38:28
What I'll do is share the article on on your coach. Go back home. Go read it.
38:34
You will find that whatever we have discussed in the class today is printed
38:38
line by line on the economist evaluation criteria of my course is that
38:44
30% of your grade will be allocated to writing a similar article like that.
38:50
What I've done is simply taken one topic of economics which is demand and supply
38:54
taken your business idea put it together and wrote a simple article on the
38:59
economist whoever has written it. Your job going forward is also to work on a
39:04
article like that. If it is good people, we will publish it somewhere. So
39:09
whatever inspires you, find that out. Whatever topic of economics you like
39:13
with me going forward, take it and write an article. Is this clear?
39:17
Let this article serve you as an inspiration for seeing something in the
39:21
future. Are you with me? Okay. My point of what is the point of
39:28
all this, professor? Why are you wasting my time? That can be a possible question
39:31
and absolutely okay if you ask it. My point to all of you is the article that
39:36
we just discussed in the class, we've broken it into pieces today just to tell
39:41
you that folks, economics is not just for policy makers. Economics is just not
39:46
for Wall Street journalists. Economics is everywhere around us. Even for a
39:51
baker in the academic city. However, all of you, how many of you
39:56
have done economics? Raise your hands. Do you economists and people who are
40:02
seeing economics for the first time understand that I'm talking about demand
40:04
and supply? How do we typically start chapter number
40:08
one in economics? Some formulas,
40:14
definitions. Do you see graphs? This is my second section with all of
40:19
you. Have I studied? Have I taught any graphs?
40:24
Where is the That was not a demand graph. Demand supply graph. You just
40:27
woke up from sleep. you go back to sleep.
40:30
He was sleeping all this while and suddenly had to put out a criticism
40:33
against me. I I take care. I'm just having fun. Uh
40:38
that was a distribution but till now I haven't given you any supply demand
40:41
graph. Are you with me? Going forward I'm going to take theory
40:46
and break it down into cases and articles and opinion pieces going
40:50
forward. You have to wake up in my class and discuss and talk with me. Beat me
40:54
down that's completely okay. But we will discuss every line going forward. Are
40:58
you with me? You take a 10 minutes break, come back
41:02
at 100 p.m. and I will show you what a demand curve looks like. Whatever you
41:07
know, I'm going to take very very simple data. And if you know economics, you
41:13
should be able to plot the right one. But I guarantee you won't be able to.
41:55
One type, one crazy match. Exactly. It was also about
42:01
It was also about ticket prices. Okay. Okay.
42:06
Huh. Nicholas, respect Nicholas. Respect my
42:13
time. Okay. Is that a broken hand or a style
42:19
in your No.
42:23
Ah, go sit. Okay. Awesome. Till the time Weber comes
42:28
back and your old professor gets older. This is a real time interview. I want
42:36
pin drop silence in 5 4 3 2 1. You can get out of my class if you need to talk.
42:43
I can be scary too. Here you go. This is a real time
42:49
stadium picture right there for you. If you go to Boston, if you go to the TD
42:58
Garden Stadium, this is a real time picture of that. What can you say about
43:03
seat number 1617? What do you think of 16 and 17?
43:14
very near to the stage. And what do you think about the pricing?
43:19
Probably high pricing. Now look at seat number 309.
43:27
Really far. And what do you think of the prices?
43:31
Cheaper. Right. Do you see how I'm making judgments on pricing just where
43:38
the seats of the stadium are? So no one good is the same over here. It's not
43:44
homogeneous goods. Every seat is different and perhaps priced
43:48
differently. Is it okay? So which means I'm using type of good to
43:53
price differently. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go back to seat number 16 again.
44:01
If you go back to seat number 16, do you if the pri if the match is on January
44:07
20th, do you think the prices are going to vary as per time?
44:11
How? Is it going to change as per time? Do
44:18
you think the seats are going to be cheaper on January 1st and more
44:21
expensive on January 19th? Yeah. Why? Yeah.
44:27
Sam say you are Cardos. Cardo. Yeah.
44:37
Oh my god. Carlo, I don't I don't want you give me your personal experience.
44:46
Carlo, let's go back to the interview. We face the same pressure as a stock
44:53
broker has in the middle of an exchange. market is open seven or eight hours a
44:57
day but my website is open for 24 hours a day
45:02
only difference is that every single ticket I sell has a value going to zero
45:07
as the event approaches what does the founder mean
45:16
closer I get to the event higher the demand especially if it's once in a
45:20
lifetime of an opportunity do you see same price or different prices
45:25
How do you think the prices changes? Prices change.
45:31
Go on. What's so funny?
45:42
Please don't. Please. You can do out. Go out and do all those things.
45:47
Go on. which means right now I'm using both
46:08
time and seat as different type of variables to differentiate on pricing.
46:14
Your marketing professor will come and teach you first degree, second degree,
46:18
third degree price discrimination. that is how can I charge differently for
46:22
different goods. GMA will walk in and teach you how can you use time to price
46:28
differently and overall teach you dynamic pricing. Are you with me? Which
46:34
means different side types of seats and time both are your variables how you can
46:39
discriminate against prices. Are you with me?
46:42
Okay, let's go back. Let's go back. You
46:48
remember how I asked all of you look at the number $1,440
46:54
for seat number 16. Remember I asked you in the seminar what
47:01
do you think price is too high or too low?
47:05
Depends on willingness to pay. Right? If I say that
47:11
the willingness to pay was $2,000 is 1440 low or high? I can charge
47:18
higher. It's very very much low right now. If I
47:21
say willingness to pay was $500, is the price too high or too low?
47:26
Which means a core time of your as a founder will go into calculating
47:32
willingness to pay. Okay. One last time to you and to you if
47:38
you if I see one more time I will ask you to leave the classroom and not just
47:42
that as my as a director of curriculum here at TET never allow you to come back
47:45
to my class. You will not behave in my class like
47:49
that. Never come back. You can keep on learning marketing from the other
47:52
professor. He's too cool. Not over here. I'm not sure what's funny over here.
48:00
Okay, come back. How do you calculate willingness to pay?
48:06
I do not appreciate it, Nicholas. Not at all. And you were one of my brightest
48:10
students over here. Unfortunate to see this behavior. Sam
48:27
Okay. Okay. One way to go about to collect collect the right information of
48:32
willingness to pay is via consumer behavior survey.
48:37
Do you often find yourself people filling Google forms? Yeah. And you all
48:41
have been doing it for your friends. What sort of information asked on those
48:45
Google forms. Sometimes your age, gender, name, are you also asked the
48:51
question, how much are you willing to pay?
48:54
Sometimes you have to tick the right option $10, $20. Now tell me what is the
49:00
problem with that form. If I'm sending a form to all of you and
49:05
saying guys please write down how much money are you willing to pay for this
49:09
pen? What's the problem? Dia, you will get the cheapest option.
49:15
Oh, you will lie. Are you with me? Which means going forward in term number two,
49:20
term number three, you'll be working on statistics and market research with me
49:25
and rupesh as well. And you will be working on these topics. Okay. I feel
49:29
very bad when I school students. No, come here.
49:36
I feel very bad. Bop.
49:42
Okay. I feel very bad. There's the other one, Bob.
49:45
Sorry, Julian. No, I scolded you. So, and I feel very
49:49
bad when I score students. Guys, it's a problem with me. I can be
49:56
very strict and when it comes to my students, in 20 seconds, I melt like a
50:01
Don't make me melt over here. Okay, come back. Number one, collect the
50:06
information from consumer behavior on their name, age, gender, and
50:10
hypothesize. As simple as that. But once you ask them GMA, what is your
50:15
willingness to pay? She will lie to you. She will lie to you. Which means you
50:19
need to know how to correct for these biases in the data. Are you with me?
50:25
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me take you to a Taylor Swift concert.
50:31
Let me take you to a Taylor Swift concert.
50:35
Guys, here's an exercise. Taylor Swift is coming to Abu Dhabi.
50:42
I'm kidding. Taylor Swift is coming to Abu Dhabi. And
50:46
guys, I have one ticket. One ticket. How much are you willing to pay for this
50:51
ticket? Brandon. 20. I I hear 100. What else?
51:05
Zero. Are there no 50s in the class? What a homogeneous classroom I've got,
51:12
guys. At least there was some participation. At least, do you realize
51:16
that what I'm doing is conducting an auction.
51:19
Okay, I can clearly see how much love you have for Swifty.
51:23
Can you all assume for 20 seconds you guys are Swifty fans?
51:30
And if you do slay, if you do actually behave in the for 20 seconds that all of
51:35
you are Swifty fans and if I say I have only One ticket. Will you still lie?
51:41
I have only one ticket, guys. And how will a Swifty behave? Run and say $100.
51:50
The highest price. I will give the highest price or the highest willingness
51:55
to pay because Gara. Huh? Because what does Ani say? What was your
52:01
number? $100. Clearly because I explicitly said that I only have one
52:07
data or one ticket and none of you wanted to risk it and people like Zanis
52:12
who were swifties gave their real number.
52:21
Okay Zani this is what happens I end up saying certain statements in the class
52:25
and that goes on for the rest of their journey at Teta going forward 50 folks.
52:35
Okay, sorry to do this to you. We'll talk after four years.
52:39
But at least do you see how my incentive to lie goes down when I conduct auction.
52:44
So auctions are one way to get the right willingness to pay. Of course, it's a
52:49
difficult exercise. You can't always go out and say my drop shipping product is
52:53
auction. I know that you can't do that. It's very very specific. Therefore,
52:57
second method is that uh consumer behavior survey that you fill forms, go
53:02
out, talk to people, collect respondent data, come back to me and we work with
53:06
statistics to get the right number out with me.
53:10
Okay. Okay. So, I just taught you different ways of calculating
53:15
willingness to pay. Let's say I did conduct the exercise and took all your
53:20
numbers about that swifty ticket and put the graph in front of you.
53:26
Can we have lower light? My students at the back.
53:33
Awesome. Whoa. Okay. Please don't fall off asleep. How many people have filled
53:39
the survey? A lot. I also know a lot.
53:44
Navy. 30. What was your name? Harsh. Rash.
53:49
Rash says 30. Rash. How do you say 30? There are many
54:00
there are many people like Rash who come in and they find the maximum column
54:06
height and they find oh 30 there must have been
54:09
30 responses that's not correct. What does this column say? How many
54:14
people? This one.
54:18
Which one? This one. So do you see how I'm adding 25 + 15 +
54:22
10 + 20 and I keep on adding and then roughly add up to about 150 200
54:29
people. Are you with me? So it looks like about 200 people from
54:34
academic city around us have filled the right answer.
54:38
I have sold the ticket to the maximum bidder over here which happens to be
54:44
Zani. And Zani had said $1,000. When he said $1,000, I said here you go,
54:51
take the ticket. He pays me $1,000. I make some profit. Good to go. But the
54:56
professor in front of you, she does something else also.
55:00
She takes the data and sells it to a ticket.com.
55:07
I mean, if not sell, give it for free. Fine. Fine. Fine. I take the data and I
55:12
give it to the CEO of a ticket.com and I say, you know what? This is real time
55:16
swifty data. How do you think the founder of a ticket.com is going to use
55:22
this data to price better? Teach me how forgot your name. Anika said maxim by
55:35
the wonderful badminton player folks. She beat me to the pulse that day.
55:41
You're looking at the maximum number of people over here because she's saying
55:45
the most volume of concentration of people are spread over here. So I will
55:49
probably charge $220 folks. This is an example of
55:54
distribution that I was teaching in the orientation that day. Your stats
55:57
professor will come and teach better distribution. Four, five sessions she
56:01
will take. Now last three, four, five sessions I will take and sit down with
56:06
modeling and teach you how do you go about XM X modeling or if not Python.
56:10
We'll see. Is that okay? But for now, you have to work on getting the basics
56:14
right. Look at it. Anika says most of the people are towards the left of the
56:21
curve or are to the left of the distribution. And she finds the some
56:26
sort of a mean number here that GMAT looks like most people are here. So if I
56:31
charge around $220, it's good for my business. What do you think, Sam?
56:40
Okay, that's total profit. Martin, I agree. Martin,
56:47
Martin says, "Garima, you have lost out on all these people because if you
56:52
charge $220, all these people will buy it from you.
56:57
But look at the heavy amount they were willing to pay." And you let them go
57:02
back, which means clearly from this data,
57:06
Nicholas I know it's icking, isn't it? Because
57:18
I'm moving away from traditional economics and not doing all those
57:21
things. You know what they have come? Yes. We
57:28
have always grown up especially ones who are done economics in 11th and 12th.
57:31
They have been told that you need a demand curve, you need a supply curve.
57:35
They should intersect and that is what I need. I did all that in the real world.
57:39
You know how that's your supply Nicholas supply of
57:47
tickets. I don't give a supply curve. That's not real world. Which
57:52
entrepreneur goes out making supply curve?
57:55
I don't know. I agree. You don't know. And I will stop
57:59
you right there because this is the time I think economics needs an update.
58:05
This is nothing but your supply curve. And at the same time, this is nothing
58:09
but your demand curve, folks. You can clearly see what the demand over here
58:14
is. Which means one strategy I can give you right away. Just look at me and then
58:19
you can beat me down to the pul. Let the price of the ticket be $1,000. Let it be
58:25
with me. And I say 70% discount for students of myriad.
58:32
Immediately when I give 70% discounts, all of you come towards the left end of
58:37
the segment and are willing to pay $220. Can you see that? And the remainder are
58:43
nothing but all the bubes and all the gimmas and all the professors who can
58:48
are who are willing to pay $1,000. This is how discount strategy comes up from
58:53
realtime demand and supply. Imagine the audacity of the professor in front of
58:58
you. Class on demand and supply. Still no demand curve. I hear you Nicholas. I
59:02
hear you. Here you go guys. Some real time example again for all of you. I
59:08
will come back to this later. Okay. Do you see three people in front of you?
59:14
Yeah. You see three responses. What can you see about these people?
59:18
What can you say about these people? A and B are
59:24
okay. A and B have same willingness to pay
59:30
and C has higher willingness to pay. Isn't it?
59:36
I want you to look beyond this graph. I also know the normal. I also know I can
59:42
also read it. Think more. Can you say something more about A, B, and C?
59:50
Why? Correct. Why do you think in real life
59:56
it's happening? Why is she willing to pay much more than A and B?
1:00:03
Which what's what's your name? What's your name?
1:00:08
Andrea is very simply saying GMA it looks like C is a bigger fan than A and
1:00:13
B. Can you see that? Ah there we go. Nidi comes back. says,
1:00:22
"Andrea, are you sure C may be richer?" I agree. If it's the reality of a fan
1:00:36
being there, you are right. But if there is any truth to what Nidi is saying,
1:00:41
then she's right. In fact, if there is any truth to what Gimma is saying, for
1:00:45
example, the concert is in Abu Dhabi. C lives in Abu Dhabi. A and B have to
1:00:53
travel all the way from Sharah and Dubai to go to Abu Dhabi, pay for the
1:00:59
logistics and rent a hotel there and stay there. So which means costs for A
1:01:06
and B are way higher than costs for C. So even though we want to hypothesize
1:01:12
that C is a bigger fan than A and B, I'm saying look at data. You may not be
1:01:16
right because A and B may be living far across
1:01:21
than C. You can hypothesize whether they're bigger fans or not. All I'm
1:01:25
saying look at the next level of data and finally assertain if C is a bigger
1:01:30
fan or not. That's all. Are you with me? How funny. She's still going after data.
1:01:35
Data. She keeps saying common sense. Keeps saying data. There is still no
1:01:38
economics. Fine. Fine. I'm looking. I'm looking. Here you go.
1:01:44
Demand curves. Happy happy. Okay, here is the context for the
1:01:50
last 10 minutes of your session. Say you launch your drop shipping
1:01:55
product at Teta College of Business. Say you collected all the responses. You
1:02:02
went around and asked people, hey Nidi, what's your willingness to pay? Hey
1:02:06
Patrick, how much money are you willing to pay for my t-shirt that I'm selling
1:02:10
in drop shipping? Andrea, Santiago, everybody. You get it? You put together
1:02:16
the data and this is how it looks like. You clean up the Google forms. You put
1:02:23
together the data, number of responses and willingness to pay.
1:02:28
I want you to take two minutes of your time. Use paper and pen and plot a graph
1:02:36
between price and quantity and show me the demand curve.
1:02:42
What does my demand curve look like? Recording not okay.
1:03:13
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. How does the demand curve look like?
1:03:46
And if you are done, you can call me. What's happening?
1:04:08
The slides went away. Use the data that I've given not random.
1:04:32
What happened? Okay. Okay. Now we don't move. Yeah. Yeah.
1:04:48
Best case. Take the screenshot. take a camera photo.
1:04:58
I want a simple plot. How does my demand curve look like between price and
1:05:03
quantity? And I distinctly remember who my economic students are.
1:05:14
I want a simple line graph. Simple line. This is no column. I want a
1:05:20
simple line guys. Simple line graph. Don't give me distribution.
1:05:29
Sorry. I mean whatever curve is coming.
1:05:35
Yeah. Whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. I just meant to say don't give me bar graphs.
1:05:39
Yes. And but give me the points.
1:05:46
You want the points? Yes. Yes.
1:05:55
all the points. Okay. No, it's okay. Okay. How much fun can I make with you?
1:06:01
Little bit. Little bit. A lot. I can make so much permission. Are you sure?
1:06:07
Oh, what's your name? Where are you from?
1:06:11
I don't know. Guys, have you gone to the Lou Museum in Paris? Yeah, beautiful
1:06:19
art. If all of you are mapping my heart rate
1:06:23
and anxiety on a graph like that, this is incorrect. Let's think more. What how
1:06:28
we can improve it? But good attempt, but let's think more. Okay. No, I see how
1:06:33
smarty pants you have been over here. No, that's not how it works.
1:06:38
Interesting. I like that. But no, what else? Arno, this is exactly copy
1:06:45
image of Arno only. You join his gang. Incorrect.
1:06:52
Try try try and when I solve it on the board it's
1:07:00
going to be so simple that you will be laughing on my face.
1:07:05
I have simply taken willingness to pay data simply given that to you.
1:07:11
But you said you have 99 out of 100 economics.
1:07:14
Yeah. Welcome to the real world.
1:07:20
Welcome to the real world. No, it won't be in the middle. Any examples there?
1:07:24
Should I come for that? I promise I will not roast you. I will roast myself.
1:07:29
Sorry. Sorry to know. Sam, show me. Show it to
1:07:34
me. Sam, that's my uh ECG report from the
1:07:39
hospital last week. That's not true. Patrick, my heart breaks into pieces.
1:07:48
My god, this is the tears that I've been after today's class. It's the tears that
1:07:53
I've been giving it out. Dead.
1:08:05
Show me. Can you pronounce your name again? Mohammed.
1:08:08
Kaml. Mohamad Kam. No. Absolutely incorrect.
1:08:16
like my tears. Anybody else? My heart rate.
1:08:21
Okay, guys. I've seen I've seen what economics we know. Okay, last attempt.
1:08:30
No. Can I try now?
1:08:36
Can I do it? Yes.
1:08:37
So, and everybody who thinks they know economics are coming back on track.
1:08:42
My whole point of view is not to make fun of you guys. Absolutely not. And if
1:08:48
if you did not study economics, thank you. You don't have to unlearn anything.
1:08:53
If you have studied economics, please unlearn and relearn with me, please. Is
1:08:59
that okay? Let me show you what's happening. Guys,
1:09:04
what's the maximum price you can charge for the t-shirt?
1:09:08
200. Awesome. I get it. What's the demand against 200?
1:09:16
Maximum price is 200, right? Demand is 100. Awesome. But then now you
1:09:23
guys want to kill me because that's what you did. That's what you plotted. Oo,
1:09:29
does it strike that little brain of ours? What's the next price, guys?
1:09:34
What's the next price I can charge? What's the demand against 150? Are you
1:09:40
sure? Are you sure?
1:09:47
150. Ladies and gentlemen, if 100 people are willing to pay 200,
1:09:55
the same 100 people will be willing to pay 150.
1:10:00
Are you with me? So, what is the demand against 150?
1:10:05
Thank you very much. What's the next price?
1:10:10
What's the demand? Ah, now we get the point. What's the
1:10:14
next price? What's the demand?
1:10:22
What's the next price? What's the demand?
1:10:27
What's the next price? What's the demand? And what's the final
1:10:32
demand? Not 900 for zero rupees. Do I have all
1:10:38
the points in front of me? Do I have a clean downward sloping graph in front of
1:10:43
you? You all would have started anywhere
1:10:49
else. Chapter one, right from here. It is so obvious downward sloping demand
1:10:54
curve. As price falls, I buy more. That is not how it works in the real world.
1:11:00
from the real world. As a founder, you go ahead collecting real time
1:11:04
willingness to pay data. You collect it. You break it down into pieces and from
1:11:10
here you get a clean economics demand curve. Are you with me?
1:11:15
You will have to go back home, unlearn everything, maybe watch the recording,
1:11:20
relearn. If you don't have to watch the recording, I promise if you spend one
1:11:24
and a half hours of your brain space actively in the class, you will learn
1:11:28
everything. You won't even have to go back and revise. Apart from that, if I
1:11:33
still failed as a professor in front of all of you, I will come and give a 900
1:11:38
p.m. doubt session maybe in myriad and we chill and have fun. Which means that
1:11:43
one person needs to be my class rep please and help me. Can somebody
1:11:47
volunteer to help me with the classes? No volunteer.
1:11:53
Will you help me Andrea? So I'll take Andrea's number and then people only who
1:11:58
are interested not all of them. If there are only two or three people who still
1:12:01
want to consult for doubt sessions can come. Cool. Go back home revise and
1:12:07
come. I'll give you some more examples of how economics can take you towards
1:12:12
business building making. Cool. Okay. Thank you very much. That's been my
1:12:15
time. See you tomorrow. 

How do businesses like Tesla leverage different product types to shift market positioning and strengthen brand identity?
12/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
Dr. Garima Chaklader
0:02
Yeah, also come back folks. Pin of silence now. Awesome. If you can't
0:09
maintain silence, you've marked your attendance. You can leave the class,
0:12
right? But I hope you don't leave the class at the same time. Okay. So, I
0:16
would need today's class. Wan, I would need today's class and the next
0:22
class. So, two classes are going into hardcore training because I'm
0:27
introducing math. If you know math, good for you. If you don't know math, I'm
0:32
going to start from scratch. Right? If you know math, I hope you're able to
0:37
reach the objective faster. If you don't know math, climb with me every step of
0:42
the way because I will slow down and answer your questions as many number of
0:46
times as possible. Now, one feedback I've got from one of
0:50
you is that maybe I'm the right person, but somehow the subject is very wrong.
0:56
So even even though the subject economics
1:01
may be very bad, trust me it's only I'm working harder so that you can
1:05
understand the subject a little better and hate it a little less. If you like
1:09
it, I hope you love it a little more. Okay, today's class is not the micro
1:15
question that had put up on LMS or your coach. Correct. Today's class was about
1:20
Tesla. Why? I will introduce Tesla if I am left with time. But what I want you
1:25
to do is to treat this class as a technical class where I talk about
1:28
formulas. However, in advanced classes, I generally take this concept and teach
1:33
at once at a stretch of one and a half hours. I'm not going to do that. I'm
1:38
going to teach about 50 to 60 minutes of the hardcore concepts here with a little
1:43
bit of application concepts and take it forward and spill it over the next
1:46
class. So, this micro question is split between two classes. Are you me?
1:51
Okay. I would also need pen and paper today and which would mean that when I'm
1:56
teaching you write down everything as possible aren't able to still follow my
2:02
class you will work with me oneon-one more
2:07
hi I said take take your pen and paper out did I ask you to also move your
2:10
mouth no okay awesome what's the micro question
2:15
can somebody read that out how was your internship or whatever it was for
2:20
very That's pretty good. That's amazing. What does the microphone say? Someone
2:25
how to implement eicity to your online store.
2:29
Are you working with e-commerce? You're working with an e-commerce
2:35
now. I'm telling you folks, stop it. 5 4 3 2 1. Thank you very much,
2:44
Priscilla. Eyes forward. When I tend teaching the
2:49
concept to all of you, don't come looking for it from day one. This is not
2:53
a day one concept. It's much more of a medium run concept. What do I mean by
2:59
that? Spend about 30 to 35 40 days roughly collecting some information on
3:04
pricing of your business. It will tell you this concept will tell you how you
3:09
are doing. This concept will not tell you what is the starting point. So don't
3:13
come to right away how can I use this in day one. more of a mediumrun concept.
3:18
Especially if you're taking forward your drop shipping business to India or your
3:21
D2C business, it will be very useful. Anyway, every time I start off the class
3:27
with a micro question, I have always questioned things like why am I wasting
3:32
your time? Because I genuinely believe that the one
3:36
and a half hours that you're spending is quite a lot of money. Why do I say quite
3:40
a lot of money? Because opportunity cost is your revenue in the drop shipping
3:43
business. You could be working this one and a half
3:46
hours outside and making some money. So the fact that you're over here, you
3:49
might as well learn something. So which means my positioning of the class. Why
3:53
does this never work? It is connected.
3:57
I need my USB. I have no idea. Why does this never
4:01
work? The USB is not connected.
4:04
Okay. Can we help it connect? Why is this useful? As simple as that.
4:10
When I teach the concept done. It'll better help you understand the
4:17
dynamics of price and demand. Wow.
4:37
Try this one. Okay.
4:42
Awesome. It'll help you make pricing decisions.
4:46
Is it good? Not sure. Maybe.
4:58
It's okay. It's okay. This works. Okay. It'll help you make pricing decisions.
5:05
It will help you answer questions as follow. Especially if you have a
5:09
question like this. Gara, do I run a discount drive on my
5:14
website? Yes or no? Is the discount drive going to hurt my revenue? Yes or
5:21
no? Or do you think that when I run the discount drive, a lot of people will
5:26
come on my websites and perhaps my revenue may go up. Well, let's see.
5:31
Second, Gara, I know for a fact that when you increase the price, number of
5:36
buyers should fall down. That's common sense. But GMA, can you please help me
5:40
answer? Will too many buyers exit my website or only a few? Folks, when you
5:47
increase your price, of course you know that buyers may drop. Common sense. If
5:52
only very few buyers drop despite you increasing the price, is it good or bad?
6:00
Good, right? Because when the price goes up and hardly any follower drop, it's
6:04
good for your business. On the other hand, if you increase your price, a
6:08
number of buyers fall way too much. It may hurt your business. Common sense.
6:14
But do you see how I'm using this increase decrease and I'm trying to
6:17
create a metric? What is that metric? Before I do introduce that metric to
6:23
you, retail giants are spending thousands of dollar collecting this
6:29
price and quantity data. Trust you me. Number one, they don't even know what
6:34
metric I'm talking about. When I tell them what the metric is,
6:39
they go all in and out in terms of really it is that simple because they
6:43
spend so much money collecting data just to better understand changes in price
6:46
and demand. If you are understanding this, if you last with me till the month
6:52
of December, I will come back in the class probably give you Python or Excel.
6:56
I don't know what you're going to be more comfortable with. I hope it's
6:58
Python. And if it is Python, we will work with an in-class application of
7:02
this very entire data to tell you whether the pricing mechanism of the
7:07
company was good or not. So that's my end objective in December. Right today,
7:12
just build the base with me. Um while retail giants have a lot of money to
7:17
sort of spend on this collection of data, a lot of small businesses don't
7:21
have. And despite the small businesses not having enough money to collect data,
7:25
sometimes I tell them they don't need that much money. Also sometimes I only
7:29
need two to three data points to work with. This class is only going to be
7:33
about two data points just two data points. And with that you'll be able to
7:37
say so much more. But then going forward what am I saying? And what is this
7:43
elasticity that GMA just showed for milliseconds? Can somebody in the class
7:47
help me with a rubber band? Rubber band. And if you can help me, be okay with
7:55
sort of letting it go because I may spoil it. Okay. Okay.
8:01
Okay. So, I have a rubber band here. Uh,
8:06
thank you so much, Manur. Folks, very simply speaking, here goes
8:12
the theatrics. Here goes the drama. If I was not a DJ, I would have been in the
8:15
theater. Come back. What is this? when I'm stretching it or when I'm
8:22
shocking the rubber band by 1%. 1% is hardly anything, right? Just 1%. I'm
8:28
shocking the rubber band by 1%. And look how the system is responding. Is it
8:34
stretching by more than 1%. Probably I can say it's very elastic.
8:39
Of course, that's all price elasticity is.
8:43
If you understand this, you understand price elasticity. I repeat louder than
8:48
that cuff of yours. When you shock the system by one,
8:55
see how the entire business is responding. Is it responding by more
8:59
than one percentage? It is.
9:01
What happened? Something I did.
9:04
All good. Yes,
9:05
it's responding more than 1 percentage. Now I repeat an economics nonsense. What
9:10
is the economic nonsense saying? when I increase the price by 1 percentage if
9:16
the quantity demanded changes by more than 1 percentage then it is very very
9:22
price elastic are you with me that's all moving next definition I'm
9:28
again changing and shocking the system by 1% guys 1% shock given force given
9:34
but it's not changing it's not changing much rather it's contracting guys so do
9:40
you see how I'm changing by 1 percentage but the system is not moving at all.
9:45
Fair to say this is inelastic. Congratulations. Your business is price
9:49
inelastic. Are you with me? All I'm going to do is take this drama and make
9:56
it into a small formula. While I was talking there about rubber
10:00
bands in my class, I will only talk to you about price and quantity. Are you
10:04
with me? Which means all I'm saying is that if I
10:17
if I move it a little bit. Okay, awesome. If
10:23
I change the price by some amount, that should have some change on quantity by
10:30
some amount. I'm only talking about price and elasticity. But when I was
10:35
shocking the system as entrepreneurs, you also always keep on asking Gara, can
10:41
I change the price? Can I increase the price? Can I decrease the price? I said
10:46
yes, you can change the price. For example, in the class I keep on
10:51
saying change the price by 1% 1% 1% just for your ease of understanding. Feel
10:57
free to change the price of your own business by 10%, 5%, whatever. But right
11:01
now understand if it's holding true for 1%
11:05
it will also hold true for 5 percentage later unitary method with me.
11:11
Okay. Let me change the price of the product
11:15
by 1 percentage. How do I calculate percentage change in price?
11:24
I'm just changing the percentage. I'm just changing the price. And what is
11:29
this triangle? Delta Delta What does this delta mean?
11:33
Change. Change, right? Change. P2 minus P1. If
11:38
the price earlier was 100 bucks and now 50, then 100 minus 50. With me?
11:43
Okay, that's very simple. So delta means change. And I'm again talking to you
11:48
about percentage change. Even when I was shocking the rubber band, it was always
11:52
1% shock, 2% shock. Are you with me? Okay. And every time I'm talking to you
11:59
about price change feel free feel free you are trying to understand what is the
12:06
percentage change in quantity correct giver attendance also okay are
12:12
you with me percentage change in quantity how much the that's all your
12:17
numerator is percentage change in quantity your denominator is percentage
12:21
change in prices are you with me that's your entire elasticity
12:26
Now let me give you some numbers. Before I do give you numbers, I write
12:31
elasticity as E. How do you measure percentage change in
12:36
quantity? What's the formula? How do you calculate percentage change
12:50
in quantity? Louder, more confidence.
12:58
New quantity minus old quantity by old quantity
13:02
into 100. Make sense? Okay. So, can I write down new quantity
13:07
as Q2? Yeah. Old quantity as Q1
13:13
divided by Q1 with me? That's just my numerator. So
13:19
I've just taken this numerator and written opened it up and wrote this
13:25
divided by what is this percentage change in price. What do I write?
13:32
New price minus old price by old price. Now whosoever said multiplied by 100, do
13:38
you see how this goes away? Gets canceled out. That's the only
13:42
reason why I'm not writing it over here. Are you with me?
13:46
Okay. Okay. Okay, then somebody in the class told me this
13:52
Q2 minus Q1 is nothing but the change and I'm just trying to write different
13:59
methods. So this can just be delta Q by Q divided by delta P by P. I'm only
14:10
condensing with me.
14:13
Very simple. Just notionally writing from one step to another. Any doubts?
14:17
No. Okay. Now, will you be in the shock of your lives
14:23
if I condense this into a very simple formula?
14:35
Yeah. What did I do? This is in the denominator.
14:39
So, this moves here and this is way below the denominator.
14:44
So, it jumps back in the numerator. Are you with me?
14:49
Any and if at all there is anybody in the class who's confused with this
14:53
moving to this you can always rely on this you'll always get your answer. Are
14:58
you with me? Okay. Then my final formula is nothing
15:03
but moving from here I have elasticity as delta Q by delta P multiplied by P by
15:14
Q. Can you write down this formula in your notebook? I will be needing it.
15:19
Which one? This. This. Just a way to write
15:24
elasticity. Just a formula. El just a notion. Elasticity is delta Q by delta P
15:32
into P by Q. If you are if you are with me here, just write down the formula. I
15:37
will need that a little more later. Why is 100 given in the beginning?
15:44
It gets cancelled out. Yes. So I anyway canceled it out.
15:47
So why is it included in the formula? It's not included. You can move it. You
15:51
can put it and then raise it on cut it out.
15:53
No. No. Like the basic formula that there is why why 100 is considered
15:59
there. It's not considered. It's getting
16:00
cancelled. So it's fine if you don't
16:03
Yeah, it's absolutely fine. In fact, elasticity will never be in terms of
16:07
Exactly. Because what will happen? Give me an
16:10
example of percentage change in quantity. Any example
16:15
10 to 8 10%.
16:17
Let's just say 10%. And give me any example of change in price.
16:22
5%. How much is 10% by 5%. Two. Don't say 2 percentage because 10%
16:30
by 5% cancels. 10 by 5 is only two.
16:36
I repeat take any example. Let's say even if I gave you like the way um
16:43
forgot your name buddy Pablo was helping me give more precise
16:47
information right take an example of Q2 Q1 Q1 now let me say I solved it and I
16:52
get the answer 10 Q2 minus Q1 by Q1 is 10%age with me and P2 minus P1 by P1 is
17:00
5%age with me 10% by 5% cancels 10 by 5 is 2 so elasticity is
17:09
two. Are you with me? What does this two mean?
17:13
Elastic. Okay. Highly. What do you mean by highly
17:16
elastic? When I'm stretching the rubber band by 1 percentage, it's responding by
17:21
more than 1 percentage. It's responding 2% times. Correct. In business language,
17:26
how do you define elasticity? You can't the rubber band example. They throw you
17:29
out the boardroom. Now, tell me the responsiveness of demand to achieving.
17:36
That was very complicated. Let's make that even more simple. Let's make that
17:40
even more simple. What does this two mean?
17:44
I just came bought into the class and I said, "Hey, elasticity equals two." What
17:48
would that mean for your business? If you change your price, people
17:53
how much does the demand change with respect to price?
17:56
GMA. So simple. elasticity equals 2 which just means it must be the case
18:03
that your numerator may have two and denominator will have one
18:08
isn't it? If somebody just walked into my class and said elasticity is two I
18:13
would say oh okay Gar taught me elasticity is percentage change in
18:17
quantity divided by percentage change in price and somebody just walks into the
18:22
room and says it is equal to two then this must be nothing but 2 by 1. Are you
18:28
with me? And that's so simple. It must mean that
18:32
as my price changes by 1 percentage, my quantity demanded must be changing by
18:38
2%age. Are you with me? Similarly, if I said elasticity is
18:44
nothing but 2. If it is equal to 02 which is highly any
18:52
changes hardly any changes must be inelastic liber band. What does that
18:58
mean? If I am changing my price by 1 percentage quantity demanded must be
19:04
changing by 0.2 percentage. Are you with me?
19:09
That's all numbers that mean. Okay. So now we know now we know how to
19:18
calculate elasticity. Now we know how to convert a mathematical number like two
19:24
and say it in terms of English. Right with me? Okay. Okay. Let's move on in
19:29
life. How do we move on in life? I don't know. I hope you can teach me.
19:36
Then let's say Pablo was opening a business and Pablo was working on his
19:41
website and he said that GMA I'm selling cups of coffee. I'm like fine sell cups
19:48
of coffee. And then he went and hired his friend and his friend's name is
19:54
which one is Krishna? Okay. Okay. You can be his friend.
20:00
Krishna comes in and Krishna goes like okay Pablo I'm going to help you out let
20:06
me go around and talk to people in my Krishna comes back to you and says a
20:11
statement that you know what I've worked with these uh batchmates of mine very
20:16
thoroughly I know how much they can drink coffee guys I'm talking about
20:20
coffee any other any other beverage I'm going to kill you are you with me so he
20:25
says a statement that says you know But I know my batchmates the price of that
20:31
cup of coffee max can be $3.9 beyond that GMA beyond that Pablo
20:38
they're not going to buy with me. So anything more than $3.9
20:44
will people are not going to buy people will
20:48
not be able to sell. Which means if Pablo ends up pricing his cup of coffee
20:55
at $4, how much can he expect to sell? So mathematically say it
21:05
zero with me. And at the same time Krishna comes back
21:10
and says, Pablo, I know them all. If you end up giving the coffee for free at max
21:16
they can have about eight cups of coffee not more than that with me
21:23
with me. Is that what you were advising me against?
21:26
No no alternate universe conversation we'll have come back later come back. So
21:31
this Krishna goes live that Pablo if you end up pricing your drinks or you give
21:34
it away for free at max these people can have about eight cups of coffee with me.
21:41
Yeah, that sounds too much. No. Eight cups of coffee. Clearly Gimma is
21:45
modeling for something else. Did you get the zoke? No.
21:55
What a forced laugh. Oh my god. Just to help me.
21:58
Okay. So, which means I collected first round
22:03
of observation P1 and Q1. Now I'm collecting second round of observation.
22:10
Krishna said I can at max have eight cups of coffee. So what do I write
22:15
and what's the price in your term zero? You had learned how
22:22
to make a line. Right? I'm not going to take my class
22:26
towards making a line. You should know how to find the equation of a straight
22:31
line with the two points. I'm not going to spend my time on it. What I'm going
22:35
to do rather is take the concept of an equation of line and baby it down more.
22:41
When I say baby it down more, if you don't know it, trust me, you will know
22:45
after this. Let's try it out. Okay.
22:50
All this time, what Gimma ends up doing in the class is that she makes a demand
22:56
curve with quantity on the x-axis and price on
23:01
the y-axis. Can somebody help me model point number one on this graph?
23:08
Where do I take this point? Where do I put it?
23:11
On the y ais. On the
23:13
on the y ais. Awesome. So, how do I put it? Quantity is zero. We always write x
23:20
comma y. x-axis is quantity. Quantity is zero. And price is 4. And what about
23:28
this point? 8 8 0
23:31
8 comma 0. Can I join these two points and assume it's a straight line?
23:39
Okay, thank God it is a straight line. Is that okay?
23:44
I know practice makes a person perfect. Anyway,
23:49
if this is clear, let me now say, let me call the top point
23:58
point A. Let me call the bottom point point C. Easy.
24:05
Can you help me understand? If I were to If I were to take this line out in front
24:14
of you, verbatim, and break it down into pieces of two,
24:20
I repeat, if I were to take the line out in front of you, verbatim, and break it
24:25
down into pieces of two, will I have two equal parts?
24:29
And what would be the center of the line?
24:32
What would be the center of the line? exactly the center of my x-axis and
24:38
exactly the center of my y-axis with me. So what's the center of my
24:43
y-axis and what's the center of my x-axis? So
24:47
can I write down this as my midpoint call it B and say that it has the
24:53
coordinates 4a 2
24:59
with me easy okay just 10 minutes back I had
25:03
said write down the formula correct what does that formula look like can
25:08
somebody tell me the formula elasticity equals
25:16
delta Q by delta P into P by
25:21
Q. Easy. What I'm going to do in the class now is
25:26
break this formula into two equal halves, two equal parts.
25:31
Which means let's solve for this
25:44
green part. What is delta Q by delta P?
25:55
Huh? Dissemble. Can I write this as Q2 minus Q1
26:02
by P2 minus P1? Do you see any data here that looks like
26:07
Q2, Q1, P1, P2? Okay. Can I use this? What is Q2?
26:14
Eight. What is Q1? What is P2?
26:18
What is P1? What is the number?
26:23
Can I take this minus2? Delta Q by delta P is minus2. Can I write this back here?
26:30
Yeah. Okay. So, which means that my final
26:33
formula becomes -2 into P by Q. Are you with me?
26:40
Are you with me? Easy. Okay. If you now know this. Huh?
26:44
Yes. Manur from which point does the Okay.
26:52
What to do? How to help you? That how much you can go even further in the
26:57
back. No, that's okay. Okay
27:02
folks, if you are following with me here. Hey, shut up. If you're following
27:08
with me here, that elasticity is minus2 by Q. Can you please take the next 20
27:14
seconds in finding out different elasticities at point A, B, and C?
27:21
Do it. Draw the line. Draw the line. Make points A, B, and C. And tell me
27:29
what are the elasticities at point A, point B, and point C.
27:55
I'm not doing that. Done.
28:05
O, Mexico, do it. Do it.
28:12
Huh? I worked on it very slow.
28:18
I was doing again. What happened?
28:22
What was the prompt? Like what are you doing?
28:24
What are the prompts? Are you clear with the prompts that A is
28:28
0a 4, B is 4a 2, C is 8 comma 0. I want you to calculate elastity at this point.
28:37
This point, this point. How do you define elasticity?
28:49
By delta P into P by Q.
28:53
But which one would be Q2 and Q1? Which one would be Q2 and Q1?
28:58
Would it be the next one over? Interesting. Come back. Come back,
29:04
guys. If you don't shut up, I will have to make you shut up and you don't want
29:07
to try my method out. Pain or silence in the class now. See
29:12
that works. You have the line in front of you.
29:15
Delta Q by delta P is what? Coming from one line.
29:19
Delta Q by delta Q is coming from this line.
29:22
What is delta Q by delta P in mathematics?
29:25
Slope. And slope of a line always remains constant.
29:30
And if GMA has spent a time already to find out slope of a line which is
29:37
delta Q by delta P, this minus2 will remain constant along the line. Are you
29:43
with me? So which means all I need to do is to use the formula - 2 P by Q at all
29:51
these three points and voila your answer comes.
29:55
Can we try that out now? Are you following me Hans?
29:59
Yeah. Are you sure?
30:01
Okay. Let's go back to the point over here. At point A, elasticity is nothing
30:06
but minus 2P by Q. Are we okay till this point? Okay.
30:13
What is price at this point? What is price at this point?
30:19
Four. What is quantity at this point? What is - 8 by 0?
30:26
Undefined. Undefined. And we also call it
30:29
infinity. Infinity. Which means this point is
30:32
nothing but minus infinity. Are you with me?
30:37
Okay. Let's move to point B. Elasticity at point B is also - 2 P by Q.
30:46
What is price at point B? Two. Okay.
30:51
What is quantity at point B? What is -4 by 4? -
30:57
awesome which means at point B elasticity is minus1 let's come back to
31:04
point C what is elasticity at point C minus 2p
31:09
by do you see how I'm using the same formula again and again right what is
31:15
price at point C zero what is quantity at point C
31:22
this number now become zero so at point See elasticity is changing.
31:30
Have you written this down? Can I move on?
31:33
Okay. Which means I can clearly see that my elasticity along the entire line ga
31:42
keeps on changing. Guys, this is funny. You know why?
31:47
Because slope remains the same. And delta Q by delta P is nothing but
31:52
the slope and that is constant. But this P by Q ratio keeps on changing as I move
31:57
along the line. Which means everybody what I've been
32:01
trying to tell you no matter what product in the entire universe you sell
32:07
in your drop shipping to see anything it will always have a demand curve of
32:13
its own which will look like this. And over time you will know how your demand
32:17
curve looks like. And that demand curve will also have a portion where
32:22
elasticity is running from 0 to 1 with me and 1 to infinity.
32:31
Are you with me guys? Look at the graph again. Look at the beauty of numbers
32:37
running from one to infinity. And why am I saying 1 to infinity the same as
32:41
minus1 to minus infinity? Why is she interchangeably using it?
32:50
What happens? Economists don't use the term minus very. They're like, "Drop it.
32:55
It is so obvious." You know why? What is the minus sign saying? As you increase
32:59
price, quantity falls. That's all the minus sign is saying. And the economist
33:03
is like, "It's too obvious." That's why we drop the minus sign and make our
33:08
lives simpler. Are you with me? Now look at the demand curve for your
33:12
product. No matter what you are selling whether it was the much much uh
33:19
controversial product on your WhatsApp group like yesterday or whether it was
33:23
the non-controversial product like a dog tag in your drop shipping business. It
33:27
could be anything. It will always have a demand curve of its own. The demand
33:32
curve will look like this. For Enzo's product over here, which was the talk of
33:36
the town yesterday, what would happen? There would be some parts of the demand
33:42
curve where people would be very elastic which means that if you end up
33:47
increasing the price of your 1% people will rapidly behave for that your
33:53
product given the conversation in the WhatsApp group yesterday is extremely
33:58
right now and I will tell you what's the revenue maximization strategy next class
34:02
but it's very very price of the pe people yesterday in Fact it is
34:09
so elastic that when you ended up increasing the price by 1 percentage for
34:14
example it could be anything for example Enzo increased it by 1 percentage demand
34:19
dropped so much such that people were coming in and also recommending their
34:23
substitutes like aliexpress.com which means it is that that very very
34:28
elastic I in such a case if you end up increasing
34:32
your price what will happen to your business
34:36
go down it'll go down but if you end are
34:38
decreasing your price of your business. What will happen?
34:41
I'm not going to make money. Yeah. A lot of people will keep running
34:45
to you because you're cutting the price. You've already got their attention that
34:49
Enzo is selling a very high market product in the market which is already
34:53
out there but he's got eyes on. Why? Because people are talking about the
34:57
product. Something must be different in that product. And if you don't
35:00
capitalize on this, it's your problem. People in Teta may not be may not be the
35:05
ones. But if you get that sort of traction, you should know how to use
35:07
this concept. But for now, that conversation on the WhatsApp group, we
35:12
all know Enzo's product is very elastic. Are you with me?
35:16
Okay. Similarly, let's say the but then it is very very elastic only at
35:23
this certain point at this section. There will be a point of time where you
35:29
may end up reducing the price such that it starts matching the competitor's
35:33
pricing. with me and if you end up reducing the
35:38
price that much such that you keep on decreasing the price people are like me
35:44
I don't want it anymore how many belts can you buy
35:49
are you with me like how much can I reduce yeah okay fine was probably okay
35:53
I may I may not people get very very in now entire traction that you had on
35:59
WhatsApp groups it's drying down this is what that inelastic means
36:04
Give him a couple of tinting there. Do you guys have a WhatsApp group,
36:09
right? There's an Instagram page running. No,
36:13
all that nonsense. By the way, DMA is everywhere. Just if you know that she
36:18
doesn't know, she's everywhere. You'll go live on Instagram if you do this.
36:23
Okay, come back. My whole point to take Enzo's example
36:30
over here was to tell you that every product will have a section where people
36:34
are behaving very elastic like the conversation yesterday and the same
36:39
product will have a zone of inelasticity where people are like me he's cutting
36:45
the price too short may I may want may not want let me give you another example
36:48
if you're still not convinced and and every time I'm saying numbers
36:54
like let me make it cleaner to have your attention a little more strongly.
37:00
All I'm saying is that the elasticity I repeat is moving from infinity
37:08
to 1 to zero. What do I mean? Infinity 20 202,000 200,000 100,000 100 200 20 10
37:19
1 All the numbers are lying over here. All the variation versus 1.8 54 3 0 all
37:28
the numbers are spread over here. What does it mean and what consumer behavior
37:32
is it capturing? The professor who's taking a class in front of you has a
37:36
dream car. It may not be your dream car. It may be very basic for you but for me
37:41
my dream car has always been a BMW M series 340i. Are you with me? And that
37:48
BMW M series 340i, I don't know how much it is in your country. In my country,
37:51
it's $100,000. And with that $100,000, let's say GMA
37:58
really wants to go and buy that M series 340i. Well, maybe 325 later, I don't
38:03
know, but let's say fixing at M340i with me. Now, Gara has that reference price
38:08
in her head that you know what, it's going to be $100,000
38:11
for for some reason. Let's say BMW launches that product at 150K.
38:19
Would VMA buy it? I can't because I have a very strong
38:22
reference point in my image in my mind, right? I can't buy it at 150. Are you
38:27
with me? So, which means that $150 is nothing but
38:32
this point. $150,000. But GMA doesn't demand it. Are
38:36
you with me? BMW realizes that it has made some sort
38:40
of an error. GMA is not buying it or people like Gimma are not buying it, BMW
38:46
reduces to cut the decides to cut the price and the moment it cuts the price
38:52
to let's say about let's say it has launched at 125 and she wasn't able to
38:56
buy it and she reduced it to or BMW reduces to 100K now it matches my
39:01
expectations right in fact it matches the expectations of all people like Gara
39:07
who are going to run to the store to buy BMW so Just with this cut in price, a
39:13
lot of people are running to BMW to buy it. So can you see this heavy
39:18
responsiveness or the heavy sensitivity to price cut?
39:23
This is that number infinity. Infinity in itself has no meaning. It is
39:28
just saying well if you start off with an impossible number where people can't
39:32
buy the product and cut it even a little people will get crazy
39:37
happy. That's what you probably did for your business. that at at this price I'm
39:42
not going to buy it but if I cut a little bit all people who were wanting
39:45
to buy from Enzo all people like GMA who wanted to buy BMW go running to that
39:50
store and that number is infinity are you with me
39:54
okay let's say BMW cuts the price to 90k 100k limit was a reference in my head
40:03
and it falls to 90k what do you think people will do
40:06
buy more run more wow $10,000 save right So which means from infinity I come to
40:12
this point let's say still very very high responsiveness then BMW says 85k
40:16
82k good for me right I'm saving money and I'm getting an M series 340i can you
40:21
see it so which means all that BMW is doing is
40:25
cutting the price and heavy responsiveness such that wow I'm going
40:29
to own M series guys when I say M series I'm not going to get into the
40:34
specificities and show myself as a nerd it is some beautiful car are you with
40:39
It's some MC. It's some exclusive club. Now, let's say BMW says, "Hey, we're
40:46
going to sell the same car at 50K or 45K." What would you do?
40:53
You wouldn't buy it. I wouldn't buy it.
40:55
It is not the idea of the car. It is not the idea of the car. I'm no
41:01
longer in the exclusive car club. It looks like anybody can buy that M340i.
41:06
Are you with me? So which means as the price cuts way too low people are
41:13
interested one or two people still may get up and say no no no I will buy it I
41:17
may buy it but that crazy responsiveness goes away that heavy sensitivity goes
41:22
away which means even for a product like BMW or even for a product like uh the
41:29
Priscilla's what is that called tell me the name
41:34
elanthrome right that that belt over there may end up having an extremely
41:40
elastic portion and extremely inelastic portion. Are you with me?
41:46
Sure. Understanding. What is elasticity?
41:53
Responsiveness. Make it better. I did better than that.
42:02
Define elasticity. So how much the demand changes
42:08
when the price drops? My dear god, even better help.
42:14
Sensitive. Forget I even even simpler. Even
42:17
simpler. How do you define the elasticity?
42:21
Then I may be a really bad teacher. Consumer change the price.
42:25
We change the price by how much? 1%.
42:28
1%. And we look at what quantity.
42:33
You see how much is that clear?
42:36
That is elasticity. Going back if the number is 20. How do we define 20? What
42:43
do we mean by 20? If I say elasticity is 20, what does
42:50
that mean in English? Highly elastic. Thank you very much.
42:56
Monkeys, what does it mean in English? What does it mean in English? You can
43:00
call me gorilla. I've always given me the permission. What does it mean in
43:04
English? Marcus is very sensitive to
43:05
Marcus is very sensitive. Give me more English sentences.
43:10
Go back to your definition. People
43:14
behavior will be dragged with a 1% change in price 20% change.
43:18
GMA if you end up increasing the price by 1% demand will fall by 20%. With me
43:25
similarly elasticity of 02 same story ka if you increase the price by 1% demand
43:30
will fall form by 2%. Is this understood? So you will say that having
43:35
a high elasticity product is something good or bad.
43:38
Ah it depends on what pricing strategy will be. You have started asking the
43:43
right questions. This will come in session number two.
43:47
But but but now that you're asking me let's go over some examples. Can you
43:51
give me some examples of inelastic markets?
43:54
Medicines. Medicines. Why do you say medicines?
43:57
It's a necessary requirement. People will buy it even if it's more expensive.
44:00
So if you end up buying a necessity, if it's a necessary product, no matter how
44:05
much price increase you do, people will still keep on buying it. Congratulation.
44:10
Lesson number one. The drop shipping product you're working with. The more
44:14
close it is to necessity, the more pricing power you have. It is so simple
44:20
because if you increase it, people will still demand it. No matter what, there
44:24
would be hardly any drop in demand. Are you with me?
44:28
Okay. If uh a little bit of
44:34
now the person standing in front of you is also a development economist.
44:41
This is for you to go back home and revise. I've taught all these things.
44:45
Okay, look at the graph here. What's happening to the prices?
44:55
Increasing by how much? By a lot. How lot?
45:03
Can you see the price going up from $20 to You are right. Even I can't see it.
45:08
Nur, I know it sucks. I'm so sorry. I don't know how to do it. Next time maybe
45:13
come forward, guys. The price is going all the way from $250
45:19
to about $250. So, the price is almost up by 100%.
45:25
Yeah, almost 100%. And what do you Huh? 1,000%. Did I make that mistake?
45:30
Thousand%. Okay. Price is up by thousand%. What do you think must be the
45:34
drop in demand? None.
45:36
People needed that number according to my uh estimation with the developed
45:42
countries. I'm talking about USA here is.16
45:47
number should have been zero.16% of lives are being lost because people
45:54
can't afford insulin anymore. What does it speak about the medical industry even
45:59
for United States of America? You want to you want to take a shot on the
46:04
numbers when I talk about the African subsaharan economies? It's dismal. Do
46:09
you want me to take a shot at the number when I talk about Middle East economies?
46:12
Better off. But this is how a concept of price elasticity can reflect not only
46:18
business learnings for you all but also the status of economies, health
46:22
economies across the world. Are you with me? Okay, now that you know that this
46:28
has relevance in not only economics but also business and inelastic markets can
46:32
be medicines because you need it no matter what. Give me examples of elastic
46:37
products. Luxury products.
46:39
Luxury products. What does that mean? So if you end up increasing the price,
46:46
what happens? People may want it even more
46:52
luxury products. In fact, now that the point has come in, think about luxury
46:57
product. If the price of that product goes up, if
47:00
the price of that product goes up, will you buy more of that product because
47:03
it's luxurious? Some people may want it more and more.
47:10
Some people may not be able to afford it, but some people may buy it more and
47:13
more. Luxury product is one product that I don't take as an example when I talk
47:17
about demand curves. It can fail, very badly fail. Give me more examples of
47:22
elastic products. Commodities. Give me more.
47:30
Give me more. Hane.
47:34
Plane ticket. What does plane ticket mean? That if the price of plane tickets
47:37
goes up, I'm not going to fly anymore. I'll probably take the train. So, can be
47:42
very elastic goods. What else? Good. What else?
47:49
Now of course just like your price of cabs
47:54
may be elastic sometimes if it's too expensive you will do app substitution
47:59
what about TV industry electronic industry elastic inelastic
48:05
why no
48:10
I I don't I don't understand if you say there are competitors right
48:13
there and if I end up increasing the price of this Samsung TV you'll hop on
48:18
to buying buying an LG television. So, which means quantity of the Samsung
48:22
TV will fall by a lot. Are you with me? Okay. So, that means it's elastic.
48:25
That means it's elastic. Are you okay?
48:28
What about iPhones? Inelastic.
48:34
Inelastic. No, because like it's the brand that
48:37
holds it and it's inelastic. I'm confused.
48:39
Uhhuh. I know. That was the point. Is iPhone.
48:43
It should be in elastic. Okay. But people keep buying it.
48:45
People keep buying it no matter what. It can't be elastic.
48:48
No, it is elastic. It is elastic.
48:52
It depends on the market. And every time I say depend, you say
49:00
data. Every time I say depends, you say data.
49:05
Ladies and gentlemen, there can be a section of the class which say, you know
49:08
what, I'm a loyalist. I'm going to buy iPhone no matter what. There could be a
49:12
section of the classroom who say, GMA, don't me too much.
49:17
How much can I keep on buying? How much can you increase the price? If you
49:20
increase the price way too much, chuck it. I'm going to go and buy a Google
49:25
Pixel, for example. There could be people like that, which means I need
49:28
data. I need to conduct secondary market research. You will go out of my class,
49:33
wash your face, take a break, get your ass back at 3:35, and we will resume
49:39
this activity. Thank you very much, guys. 35
49:43
3:35 I've been counting
57:57
laughing about So I
58:24
went down
58:46
and Yeah. Sorry.
59:11
What was that? teacher, can I ask you? Uh we were
59:48
talking about the elasticity and I I was trying to explain
59:52
that because um like in our free concept elasticity it's also like the if you
59:59
need it that it's not elastic because you even if it like the pharmacy concept
1:00:04
no but um we were talking just in that way but you were talking for example I
1:00:10
was thinking about the other elastic is just like this this can be like this so
1:00:16
that could be the willingness to wait also. Yeah. Is that okay?
1:00:24
Sit down. Sit down. Oi. Sit down.
1:00:29
Okay. Oh, welcome back, Sebastian. Happy to
1:00:33
see you back. Go.
1:00:39
What? See you. We're sitting right here. What will you see?
1:00:45
Sit down. Okay. Monkey energy in the class. Back
1:00:52
working. See math. Okay. Getting friendly.
1:00:58
Yeah. Better. I have studied economics before.
1:01:01
You have studied economic before. Then you want to come and take the class
1:01:04
here. No, I mean it's easy. Come back.
1:01:07
Okay. Thank you. Fine. Very good. I'm looking forward to 100 in the
1:01:11
examination that I'm going to give. I was talking to the one behind you.
1:01:14
Me? M. No, no. At least understanding something.
1:01:19
I can relate. I just don't like
1:01:25
on my face. She's saying she doesn't like it. At least
1:01:28
I just don't like it. Look at it.
1:01:31
I didn't do economics. Ma'am, I understand.
1:01:34
Can like my heart is breaking and also mending at the same time. That is what
1:01:38
you're doing to me. Okay. Coming back.
1:01:42
I'm 50 minutes over from that. You're not teaching.
1:01:46
You said only 15 application coming up.
1:01:53
So I will not do the math. You will do the math. which
1:01:58
coming back people in the classroom while I agree with you that uh your
1:02:05
iPhone tends to be more of an inelastic good but there can be a lot of people
1:02:09
who end up say that you know for the current price point if you increase the
1:02:13
price even more I'm not going to buy from you I'm going to move to another
1:02:18
brand if that happens then it's a very elastic product which means to confirm
1:02:25
what the hell I'm saying I will need market data.
1:02:29
Treat me as your research assistant. When I say research assistant, I have
1:02:34
conducted the study
1:02:48
for you. Okay. You tell him. Why you telling me? He finds you cute. As simple
1:02:52
as that. Come back to class. I have conducted the secondary market research
1:02:57
for you which means I've gone out and searched for the pricing data and the
1:03:01
quantity data. Good luck to all of you doing that in real life. Really good
1:03:06
luck if you're able to find that clean price data and clean quantity data.
1:03:10
Nothing like it. But for now, I have tracked online prices of iPhones which
1:03:17
look like this. And where do you think I can find
1:03:23
quantity data from iPhone? Will iPhone ever declare how many
1:03:30
iPhones they have? And it's very very difficult to find
1:03:34
such data. What I've done right now even so then you conduct a this is called
1:03:40
primary survey. When you say survey it means primary research method. What does
1:03:45
it mean? I go out and ask people and I collect data from suppliers and people
1:03:48
as simple as that. When I say secondary market research, it means I rely on
1:03:53
published data. One way to find published data is to rely on so I was
1:03:59
about to say social media but consultancy reports. What consultancy
1:04:04
reports? Gartner is an international organization
1:04:08
that publishes market share data. Bupes will again come back to you later in our
1:04:14
lives and say market share is nothing. There's nothing known as market share
1:04:18
like the way he has said that for loyalty but for now look at the data
1:04:21
over here. It says worldwide uh worldwide smartphone sales for all
1:04:28
the brands. I want you to focus on iPhone only.
1:04:35
Further I want you to focus on iPhone between 2017 and 2018.
1:04:43
Here is your data 2017. Here's the data 2018. Here's the data 2017. Here's your
1:04:49
data 2018. In the class, take 2 minutes. No talking. Absolutely no talking. I'll
1:04:55
take you and I'll throw you out. No talking. Take 2 minutes. Use the
1:04:59
elasticity formula that I have taught you. Use the data from here to calculate
1:05:04
whether iPhone markets is inelastic or elastic. Meanwhile, again, no talking.
1:05:10
You give me your phone and I'll take a better picture for you. I can do that
1:05:14
for you. So, anybody has their phone can pass their phone and I will take better
1:05:18
pictures. We're comparing to
1:05:23
it's okay. Just for apple.
1:05:36
Pass it on to Manur. Ah, man. Oh, that's not Man's.
1:05:42
Manor, you have a passcode. Okay.
1:05:55
What do we do? Do we assume the price? It's given. What does
1:06:04
all three are iPhones? All three are iPhones. Give me your
1:06:07
phone. Phone. You can see.
1:06:09
I can take a picture. But all three are Which one do you choose? If I tell you
1:06:17
everything, what's the point of longer the curve? All curves along only. Oh no,
1:06:22
no, that's not how you choose. Think Priscilla, you're on the right track.
1:06:28
Pressella is asking what which one to choose? GMA, all our iPhones. Use your
1:06:33
brains. If I tell you everything, what's the
1:06:36
point? The color was nice. Anybody else? Yeah.
1:06:52
Pass the phone, please. You can go yourself and click. No.
1:06:59
What are you doing? Please pass it on to I don't have your
1:07:14
name tag. Do
1:07:20
I already did it? Sure.
1:07:22
That has a lot of for example don't charge GPT.
1:07:28
Do it. I want to see it in your spreadsheet or copy and charge 100% is
1:07:32
incorrect. Okay. here. The only difference is like
1:07:35
this iPhone 4, iPhone 3, iPhone 6. But uh basically like the higher the
1:07:42
iPhone, the more you want, you know, sync. Okay, that's a beautiful way of
1:07:46
putting it. So you decide what price you want to
1:07:49
choose. I'm okay, but you have to defend your argument.
1:07:53
You are a consultant, a market research consultant. You must defend your
1:07:58
answers. Which price to choose? All our iPhones.
1:08:07
Hey, done.
1:08:32
Think, think, think, think.
1:08:38
On the right track. You and I both don't have chairs.
1:08:51
I can make the students move back. Would you want to sit here? No. H
1:08:55
I need help. I need help.
1:08:58
Why? I don't understand. No.
1:09:01
What points do I use? Use your head.
1:09:04
My head doesn't work. It works. It works beautifully. It just
1:09:07
sits into 50,000 things at once. You can do it. Yeah.
1:09:12
So, I got Delta Q. Delta P. How did you get Delta Q? Delta P.
1:09:18
Delta Price. Which ones did you choose?
1:09:22
Uh 88. Why?
1:09:25
2018 and then 2018.
1:09:30
Why? Yeah. Why? Why those two prices? Why not
1:09:37
the other one? Because between we're looking at the
1:09:40
elasticity between those two. Yeah. And this is also these two points.
1:09:44
This is also these two points. This is also 2017, 2018, 2017, 2018. And
1:09:52
all our iPhones. Yeah. Can we just not
1:10:00
There are different models of iPhone, right?
1:10:03
We can just add them, right? Add them.
1:10:09
Okay. Yeah.
1:10:16
Just when a little bit of real world comes, common sense goes out.
1:10:20
Yes. 45us
1:10:25
45 too high too big
1:10:29
too which three.3
1:10:37
okay okay then it's a calculation mistake
1:10:43
yes man what
1:10:51
fine I happen to have Well, when I get fat, I
1:10:54
call the quantity anyway. Yeah, tell me. Okay, I'm a little confused. So, I did
1:10:58
the quantity, but for the price, there's 2018 and 2018. Is there 2017? There's
1:11:02
2017. This is all 2017.
1:11:04
Yeah. Yeah. So, which one? I think um I don't want to
1:11:08
think uh what you don't want to. You have to. That's my job.
1:11:12
I got the numbers wrong. This should be this one.
1:11:15
Thank you very much. You guys are thinking the right
1:11:21
question, but when it comes to answering, I don't know what to think is
1:11:24
the answer. Do you have it? Do you have something right now?
1:11:29
Name. What's your name? Oh my god.
1:11:35
What's your name? Brandon.
1:11:36
Brandon. What's the answer?
1:11:41
Confused, bro. repeat the question.
1:11:54
It's a very simple question. What is the elasticity for Apple iPhones moving from
1:12:01
2017 to 2018? Which means you need price 2018 price
1:12:07
2017 quantity 2018 quantity 2017
1:12:13
and calculate percentage change and give me elasticity.
1:12:18
Yeah. Anybody got closer to the answer?
1:12:27
You got it. Okay. Manor, come all the way there.
1:12:33
Wow. Yes.
1:12:36
Can you? Yes, I can.
1:12:38
Like, let me know. I think I kind of I kind of BSed it.
1:12:41
Okay. Very close.
1:12:44
Very close. What am I missing? Very close.
1:12:47
What did I do wrong? Wait, the one. Let me see. Let me see. Where did you get
1:12:51
these numbers from? I'm like actually enjoying math. Okay,
1:13:04
so there's this one, right? And then
1:13:06
now you're up from sleep. This one is this. Oh, is this supposed to be a six?
1:13:11
Which one is one? Six or seven, sir? One one is 960
1:13:17
and the other something. Final answer is pointing
1:13:23
946 average like
1:13:32
2017. I think it's good
1:13:42
because you're not subtracting. Okay, come back. Show me
1:13:46
uh which I used by accident and units and market share reports where it should
1:13:51
be price quantity and quantity but even if the
1:13:55
process is right it's okay okay come back enough is enough everyone
1:14:02
shuts up now everyone shuts up in 3 2 1 thank you at least what you have done is
1:14:10
put yourself out there with the numbers so when I use the numbers to expl
1:14:15
explain it's going to be so simple that you'll understand and then think why
1:14:18
didn't I do it however a lot of you have already begun thinking in the right
1:14:23
direction a lot of you have cracked the answer also what I'm going to do is give
1:14:27
yourself give you guys a final push and I'm hoping you can do it if not it
1:14:34
is all me not you guys look at the data over Here
1:14:46
the talking stops. Now look at the numbers. This is year 2017.
1:14:53
It says €1180. It says €920.
1:15:08
Yeah, I know. If you guys don't shut up, I will not
1:15:11
teach. Trust me, I can go beyond 4 p.m. Sam. That's Sam, right? What's his name?
1:15:17
Yeah. Ned.
1:15:17
Ned. Don't talk. Back. Start. What's this number here?
1:15:25
810. 810.
1:15:28
Very good. What price do I take? Average. Why? Because Gimma has said
1:15:33
average. When you take an average, number one,
1:15:39
you can't choose between any of the iPhones. Why? Because if it said
1:15:43
worldwide, this is iPhone 4S. If it said worldwide
1:15:48
4S sales, then you could have taken these two data points and you would have
1:15:52
been free. But this entire smartphone sales is all the iPhones combined over
1:15:58
here. Then which iPhone price do I end up take taking
1:16:04
over here? All of them correct. But what happens? This is 850 920 sorry 810 920
1:16:11
1180 number one you are correct GMA take an average
1:16:16
what is the problem with the average what is the problem
1:16:22
we don't know the quantity yes and when does my average become a problem
1:16:28
my average becomes a problem because let's say this is 20904 units correct
1:16:36
2200 000 units. If this 200,000 units mostly has iPhone
1:16:45
4S, then my average should be around 1180.
1:16:49
Correct? If most of the units has iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, then my average should be
1:16:59
close to 810. Are you with me? But I don't know how does my distribution of
1:17:05
iPhones look like which means I'll start off with an average and write in my
1:17:10
research consultancy report here is the problem I don't know my distribution so
1:17:16
I am assuming equal distribution of all these phones and that's why saying take
1:17:20
an average are you with me that's all that's all once you know the
1:17:25
limitation of your own process this is good to go what is average of so if I
1:17:31
have to calculate Absolute average over here. Price of 2017 is average of 1180
1:17:39
plus 920 plus 850 some 810. Sorry. Can somebody
1:17:46
tell me the average? 970.
1:17:48
970. 970. Sure.
1:17:52
Okay. Okay. What's the data here? 1260
1:17:58
1160 860
1:18:02
Can somebody help me understand average of 1260
1:18:08
173 okay 1160 860 Priscilla help me with the
1:18:13
number again 1 173 are you with me but now you also
1:18:20
know GMA is assuming equal distribution of all three models
1:18:26
Cool. Okay. With this assumption, I'm going forward. Do you see quantity 2017
1:18:32
here? And do you see quantity 2018 here? Can I
1:18:38
finally use the math that I had discussed in the entire class?
1:18:42
Elasticity is nothing but percentage change in quantity by percentage change
1:18:48
in price. Let's calculate percentage change in price, which is P final.
1:18:54
What's my final price? What's my initial price?
1:19:02
Divided by 970.
1:19:04
What's the answer? 545
1:19:09
percentage total all the answer 545 by 970. What's that answer?
1:19:17
How much is this percentage? Enzo. Now you use charge GPT. No. Find
1:19:23
out Pablo.
1:19:28
We put the data points wrong. Understood. I know. But can you help me?
1:19:33
I don't have the answer. Can somebody calculate?
1:19:39
0 0.1.
1:19:45
Sure. Okay. The can we calculate percentage
1:19:49
change in quantity? How much is Q final?
1:19:55
Uh 214. Let me solve it better. Next time I
1:20:02
should have space. Qfal percentage change in quantity
1:20:12
is Q 2018 minus Q 2017
1:20:19
by Q 2017. What is Q 2018?
1:20:25
2094. Got it. And old quantity.
1:20:31
214 924. Got it. And this is also 214924.
1:20:37
Can somebody please tell me what's the answer?
1:20:47
Final answer. 0.00
1:21:09
I want everyone to do it otherwise I'm not going out of the class. Do it. Take
1:21:14
your calculators out. Everybody take your calculators out. I
1:21:19
want percentage change in quantity right now. Take your calculator out.
1:21:31
You can shut the uh you can. Yeah. And let it be. Okay. Can you see?

How can your business determine the optimal price range to maximize revenue?
16/09/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Dr. Garima Chaklader
0:41
I was thinking Okay. Hello. Can you hear me? Audible.
5:05
Audible. Can we get the sound up, please?
5:10
Necessary. Just a little bit. Yeah, I think it works now.
5:17
Okay, we working. Is it working? Okay, I think it
5:24
works only under the Okay, up and active. How was your
5:29
finance class? Cool, right? Good. No, it was good.
5:37
Okay, awesome. Uh, what are we going to do in this class?
5:44
Okay, let's get running. Not really. Get your notebooks out, pen and paper out.
5:52
And if not pen and paper, at least make sure that you participate in the class
5:56
because I have decided to run through some applications. And what are those
6:01
applications? Whatever we have studied in session number one, two, three, quick
6:06
revision and applications and questions that can
6:10
be uh conceptually based questions. Good to go. So which means again I will teach
6:15
you something but most of it you will have to answer in the class today. And
6:19
your first question that's coming up raise your hands.
6:24
What do you think happens to my demand curve when the price of an Uber car ride
6:31
reduces from $20 to $15? Raise your hands.
6:37
Can I also have your name cards now that we have managed to get that?
6:50
Bruno, you want to try? Yeah. Demand curve goes up. Okay.
7:09
Has Zoom been started? Should we just do that? Okay.
7:33
Okay. What happens to my demand curve? It moves up. How exactly? So, let's say
7:37
I have a demand curve. Imagine I'm making a demand curve. It's downward
7:40
sloping. What happens to it? Bruno,
7:47
you have a demand curve that is downward sloping. You said that price of the ride
7:51
falls down, so demand should go up. What happens to my demand curve?
7:56
Shifts to the right. No, the point changes.
8:05
Curves the same. Why?
8:10
I have no idea why he's saying that. Yeah.
8:13
Price fell down. Price fell down. What is Surange saying? I'm not able to
8:21
understand. Are you all able to understand?
8:25
Yeah. But then Bruno is saying or what is
8:30
one? There would be a downward movement.
8:39
Penelope price falls down of the cab. So which
8:53
essentially means that the money increases.
8:59
So I'm saying demand curve. You're right about the supply. But then what happens
9:03
to my demand? If the price has fallen down from $20 to $15 or 20 15. Will you
9:09
want more caps because price has fallen down?
9:14
Huh? Martin, are you talking to yourself?
9:22
Yeah. So, I'm talking about normal things. So, the
9:27
price normally has fallen down and normally you would want more cabs. Now,
9:31
in that normal situation, for a normal demand curve, where does the point
9:34
normally move? It was
10:09
on the This is my original demand curve
11:11
and the ones who have been speaking I don't want you to talk
11:15
but look at the original demand curve it price has clearly fallen down and if
11:21
price has fallen down what happens to my demand curve moves in moves Without
11:24
movement along the curve, what happens? Moves to the right.
11:32
The man curve does not move or does it move?
11:38
It doesn't move. How many of you it doesn't move?
11:42
How many of you it moves? No, we have a couple of hands here. We
11:48
have two, three hands over here. Right. Very very simply speaking folks, the
11:54
first half of the class is precisely right. When I'm talking about price
12:00
factors, it only leads to movements along the curve. It doesn't lead to
12:05
shifts in the curve. Remember that. You want to see magically how? Look at the
12:10
number over here. When I'm saying price of the cab is about $20 and let's say
12:16
it's confusing you, Patrick, it's $20. You can clearly correspondingly see okay
12:23
about 50 students wanted the ride can you see that and then I said that the
12:28
price fell down to $15 isn't it I can clearly go back to my same demand curve
12:34
and find out oh now 75 students won the demand won the cab did I shift any line
12:42
do you see how there's only movement in the curve right I'm very happy to see
12:46
that about 50 60% of the classroom has said movement along the curve Generally
12:50
the ones who did not even raise their hand. I know you wanted to inherently
12:54
say there's a shift in the curve but I hope you will not say that anymore. Is
12:57
that okay? So then what will lead to shifts in my curve
13:04
change in quantity can change over here that's
13:08
also movement in that's also movement around the demand curve. So not quantity
13:15
change in the product or What does that mean? Change in the
13:23
product or perception. What does that mean?
13:30
Willingness to pay changes over here as well. What else? What?
13:39
Price remains constant but the demand shifts.
13:42
The demand changes here as well. Ah, price remains constant but the demand
13:47
changes. That is so beautifully put. Let me see what what did she mean by
13:52
that. She's just saying go back to your demand curve
13:57
and you will have price over here and quantity over here. You have a downward
14:01
sloping demand curve. Now I'm pushing her to think what moves my demand curve
14:06
because till now there is only movement as I change my price. Is that clear? And
14:10
she's saying you know what do the magic keep the price con keep the price
14:14
constant. If the price is $20, keep this constant. I just want higher
14:21
demand given the same price. Does that make sense? Okay. Okay. She said, go
14:27
back to the $15 you were talking about. Earlier, this was the quantity for the
14:33
same price. Ga, I again want more demand. Does that make sense? For a
14:38
line, you need two points. That's not true. For a line you need one point but
14:43
you'll have infinite number of lines. But for a specific line of a specific
14:47
slope you'll want two points. Do I have two points? Can I draw a line?
14:54
Just imagine it's passing through the points.
14:57
But for that reason now what I'm doing geographically mathematically
15:02
Anaka is right on spot. But you know what? I'll have to keep my prices
15:06
constant and for every price level demand should be higher. When will it be
15:11
true? In real life there is a terrorist attack. Awesome.
15:23
Not awesome. But I I just meant to say that the
15:26
example that he has given. Hey come back also just couldn't find another
15:38
or if at all there is a threat of outside uncertainty. You wouldn't want
15:43
to be going I let me finish. So let's say there's outside uncertainty
15:49
people may not want to go out right of course supply would shift but also
15:52
you're staying within home demand and demand for all goods and services fall
15:56
down something like that makes sense like who for very simply speaking learn
16:01
from him how to say unnatural consequences.
16:07
Okay. Any Okay. So, number one, outside events, right? Or I call them
16:13
macroeconomic shocks. Shocks. Uh shocks,
16:20
right? Uh causing uh political uncertainty or health uncertainty so on
16:25
and so forth. And okay, she's talking about can I talk
16:31
about festivities when suddenly there is a surge in demand?
16:36
Suddenly I want um um more clothes festival related clothes or Christmas
16:42
shopping more and more right seasonal variation.
17:00
Can you hear Nicholas? What he means to say is what this guy has been saying for
17:04
minute number one. Every nonpric factor, any other factor that doesn't have the
17:11
word price written on it, Dha, that causes a shift in my demand curve. Is
17:15
that clear? One very simple, very simple common sense you're missing out on. And
17:22
when is it really? Huh? Marketing. Yes, that's true. That's also
17:27
non price factor. Does marketing have the word price written in it? So, it's a
17:32
Non-pric factor. What's a non price factor? Anything that
17:36
doesn't have the word price written on it?
17:39
Quality. Absolutely agreed. Consumer income. Going back to you,
17:45
Anita. Let's say the price remains $20. If your income goes up, will you demand
17:50
more rides at $20? So, which means which means that yes,
17:56
which means that as income increases, my demand curve moves to the right. Is it
18:01
clear? Okay, then this should be clear. When a K K-pop idol endorses sneakers,
18:06
what happens to my demand curve? Anmar, where's your name card? Okay.
18:14
What's happens to my demand curve when K-pop
18:22
idol endorses sneakers? Increases how chips to the right. What
18:28
about price of coffee bean rises? What happens to my demand for tea?
18:35
It goes up. I'm saying when price of coffee bean
18:45
rises, what happens to my demand for tea?
19:00
There are two things happening right now, right? There are two things
19:05
happening right now. Number one, when demand for coffee rises, sorry, when
19:09
price for coffee rises, what happens to my demand for coffee?
19:14
It reduces. Yes. Yeah. So,
19:28
but there is a very good chance that for an entire collective the demand can fall
19:33
down, right? I'm talking about an elective.
19:36
I'm talking about a market here, guys. Not talking about individual consumer.
19:40
For you, it may make sense that you keep on sticking to it despite the price
19:43
falls. But I'm talking about a market over here. Okay? When that makes sense,
19:47
our question repeats. Price of coffee bean rises. What happens to the demand
19:52
for coffee beans? Reduces. Movement along the curve or shifts in the curve.
20:00
Just when I say the simple things but write down two lines back to back, there
20:04
is confusion in the class. This is your coffee demand curve. Right?
20:11
Earlier the price was $10. Now the price has become $15
20:17
per coffee bean pack. What happens to my demand
20:22
reduces? I'm right now saying coffee. Coffee falls movement along the curve.
20:29
Done. Now I'm talking about demand for tea. Consider this as my tea market. Now
20:36
what happens to my demand for tea? Shifts.
20:43
Do you consume more tea as price has gone up? Okay. So that's movement or
20:47
shift. Shift. But then it's a price factor. How is it a shift?
20:53
It's it is a price factor. Price of coffee.
20:58
Ah not for tea. Only if it was price for tea then there would have been movements
21:04
along the curve for tea. But this is price of coffee ga. This is a non-pric
21:08
factor for tea. Right? So as my price of coffee bean rises, demand goes up to the
21:14
right. Are you with me? So what are these coffee beans and tea
21:20
substitutes? Are you with me? My question to all of you.
21:27
That's okay. That's okay. That's okay. So what? Of course. Just because there
21:32
are 10,000 substitutes does not mean that I don't talk about one substitute.
21:39
I'm not saying that much it even if it's a little much it's still a change I'm
21:42
talking about any change I never quantified the change come back every
21:47
time we have open the book and read examples like Nicholas Alvaro every time
21:54
we have talked about examples like tea and coffee are substitutes that's what
21:57
we have grown up reading right I want to go back to what bu your name Carlo what
22:03
Carlo was saying and I kind of trust kind of go with
22:09
was saying, even though I did answer him that I'm talking about a market as a
22:13
collective and not an individual person, does it really make sense when the price
22:18
of coffee goes up, you will start consuming tea suddenly? How many of you
22:22
are coffee lovers? Raise your hand. How many of you tea lovers raise your
22:26
hand? What the rest of you are water lovers? What do you
22:31
Okay, so even if I were to Okay, fine. Even if you guys are water lovers or any
22:35
other drink lover, let's say that price of that favorite drink of yours goes up.
22:39
Will you suddenly start having coffee? So this is what I do. Go back to Carlo.
22:43
What's a very very habituated product? Gara, what will you do? Carlo, I really
22:48
want to write to all the public publishers around the world, especially
22:52
publishing chapter number one. By the time the 50th percentage of the chapter
22:56
finishes, they start talking about compliments and substitutes and very
22:59
nicely they write tea and coffee are substitutes. Why the hell?
23:03
Why you charge whatever amount of tea you want to charge for me if it goes up
23:08
I'll stop having tea but I won't start consuming coffee like that so I do agree
23:12
with you what that demands rather is a very good deeper level of subsample
23:17
analysis what they should do is probably break down any region locality for
23:22
example I speak in for India because I'm an Indian India is divided between tier
23:27
one tier two tier three cities and strata which just means tier one or high
23:32
income consumers, tier two, mid-level and so on and so forth. It may make
23:37
sense for a tier three consumer to shift between tea and a coffee because their
23:42
individuals are more used to or habituated to drinking tea and coffee
23:47
from the small packs. In the bigger cities, we have the big
23:51
packets which are way more expensive, so people don't really care. But in the
23:55
smaller cities, if the price of a very small NEC pack goes up, people will stop
24:01
having it. So rather it it demands that subsample analysis and one shouldn't
24:05
usually say tea and coffee are subs. Are you with me? So I'm with Carlo over
24:10
there and anytime you see uh examples like that given to you just because for
24:14
the sake of theory please put them back in terms of teaching cross price
24:20
elasticity. What the hell is elasticity? Somebody
24:23
raise your hand and tell me what is an elasticity. Ah I forgotten.
24:29
Oh you can demonstrate it. Go on. Let's demonstrate this. She's stretching it.
24:37
She's stretching it. And what was happening
24:56
by demand stretches
25:02
Are you with me? Okay, look over here. When the price of
25:18
Another quantity.
25:48
I just described to you or what I was doing in the previous class I was
25:52
talking about elasticity of one product correct suddenly I'm talking about
25:57
elasticity of two products I suddenly put product A product B or tea and
26:03
coffee price of tea goes up da I will not want to have tea so much it's very
26:08
expensive quantity of tea goes down if we were treating tea and coffee as
26:13
substitutes perhaps quantity of coffee will start going up because t is very
26:18
expensive. Are you able to see how I'm relating price of good A and quantity of
26:23
good B. This is known as cross price elasticity. Are you with me? In the
26:31
previous class, I taught you own price elasticity that you're comparing with
26:36
your own data. Today I'm talking about cross price elasticity for substitutes.
26:42
Cross price elasticity is always positive.
26:46
Are you with me? You see how we are segueing from demand
26:51
curve correct? Absolutely goddamn right.
26:56
Elasticity is what? Price and quantity. That correlation
27:00
with over here when I'm talking about A and B, price of good A, quantity of good
27:04
B. When you keep on getting trained with me as I do game theory with me, you will
27:09
take data sets of Sony and Microsoft and you'll calculate all these things in the
27:13
class. But right now we go step by step. Okay. Coming back. Did you see how we
27:18
segueed from movements and shifts to suddenly about substitutes and
27:23
complements and also learn cross elasticity? Let's talk a little more
27:27
about substitutes. What are substitutes? In very layman language. What are
27:33
substitutes? Other alternatives. Other alternatives.
27:39
Right. Makes sense. Makes sense. What else? How else will you define
27:45
similar in nature Carlo same purpose what else
27:53
ah so that's why somebody said alternatives right and similarly if the
27:58
price starts going up I will switch to the other product economists use this
28:03
traditional definition of defining substitutes right what do marketing
28:09
people do marketing people say you know what Let's do an example. Which car is
28:15
this? I also know that's Volkswagen.
28:19
Which one? Which one? That's not a Polo. Jetta.
28:25
That's a Jetta, right? Okay. What about the other one,
28:32
guys? I also know that she can see the Son of Spark. No. No.
28:44
In your country, it's called cruise. And in real world also, it's called cruise.
28:48
Yes. So, Natalia and Martin got the cars right. We have a Jetta and a Cruise. And
28:55
let's talk about Volkswagen, Jetta, and Chevrolet Cruz. Ladies and gentlemen, my
29:01
question to all of you. Do you really think in real life or in non-real life
29:05
Cruz and Jetta are substitutes? All right. Carlo, can you hit me down
29:11
with white snow? Can you hear him? Anybody else with such
29:23
extreme? Imagine teaching extreme uh see imagine teaching extremes over
29:30
there. Any other point? Arno, do you have a point? Arno doesn't have a but I
29:35
remember his name. Anyway, go on. Any other opinion? opinion. Do you think
29:40
both of them are substitutes? What do you think?
29:48
You tell me you are the customer. So, it's a substitute.
29:54
No, both are different. In fact, if you want
30:01
to compare the engine sizes, if you want to compare the horsepower, if you want
30:06
to compare the rim sizes of cruise and a Jetta.
30:11
Ah, suddenly it serves the same purpose. It's a sedan car. You know what? I zoom
30:17
out with the last opinion coming from here.
30:26
Okay. How about now? I say that there was a point of time in 2017 when
30:34
Chevrolet Cruz went around in 2017 saying, "We are like folkswagen. We are
30:41
like folkswagen. Buy us, buy us, buy us." Would you believe me?
30:48
And for people like that who are on the other extreme, here is your QR code.
30:53
What I'm going to discuss in the class is a real time case study called
30:58
dieselgate scandal. My question to all of you now, when
31:03
would you really buy a substitute? Folks, folks, stop treating me like a
31:08
paparazzi. Put your phones down. I'll give you the QR code. It's okay. When
31:13
would you really buy a substitute? I can't hear you.
31:20
When the price increases. Carlo or a scandal happens now because I've
31:26
taught you scandal happens once of scandal happens [ __ ] anything else
31:30
Nicholas. Uhhuh.
31:36
When it's out of stock. So then you are a loyalist.
31:53
You may not want to move from despite the price increase. There are going to
31:56
be people like that as Carlo and I just were discussing. But let's say that
32:01
expensive coffee, that expensive caffeine drink is not available and you
32:05
want an energy drink. What will you do? So you will move for a substitute. You
32:11
then you bring back to my point. So what happens then? When do you really
32:17
buy a substitute? When the product is ways too expensive, sold out,
32:22
unavailable, a consumer will start going for a substitute. Which means your
32:28
dropshipping product either can be a compliment or a substitute.
32:34
When is it that you will really benefit yourself from selling that substitute?
32:40
When you may you can I'm not saying please go ahead and do it. You may want
32:44
to position your product as a substitute to become the consumer's original choice
32:50
for initial replacement. Are you understanding? So now what happens? Even
32:56
though you guys are precisely that right that Jetta and a cruise may not be
33:01
substitutes in reality because the features are uncomparable. Gina, what
33:05
are you teaching us? But I'm taking you back to 2017 when Cruz came out and
33:10
said, "You know what? We are just like Jetta. Believe in us. Whatever features
33:16
that you find in Jetta, you'll be able to find in Cruz." If you're not
33:21
believing in me, you can check out the QR code and check out the diesel gate
33:25
scandal where in 2017 there was a case between the US courts and Folkswagen.
33:33
Volkswagen had failed to meet the emissions requirement in the country.
33:39
They were producing way too much in terms of uh uh
33:45
the fuels. So that's what I'm saying. They failed
33:55
to meet the tests. So you did not fail to correct me.
34:01
rather actually helping me out by saying they cheated. So what happened? They
34:05
lost the case and then what happened? He was told them that whatever cases,
34:08
whatever cars that have been sold on the road have to be bought back. This is
34:12
known as the buyback program. So even though you try, you help me out every
34:16
class and for that I'm forever grateful. But with that Carlo, even though he
34:20
helped me, what was happening is that most of the cars that were being sold
34:24
out, he's very right, the tests were not
34:28
passed. the emission standards were not being met. So US the US court said that
34:34
you know what you have to buy back all the cars that you have sold. Are you
34:37
with me? So Volkswagen was supposed to buy back and suddenly all the consumers
34:42
were suddenly 100,000k richer. Everybody had money because they had to send back
34:46
the cars. Chevrolet had been closely following the court case. And the moment
34:53
the court case came in favor of the uh Chevrolet they came in on they said you
34:58
know what our car is just like Jetta we know your Jetta has to go away tomorrow
35:02
don't worry have no fear Chevrolet is here we will give you our cars whatever
35:07
features you want from folkswagen Chevrolet serving right there are you
35:11
with me again to prove my point let me tell you there were advertising offers
35:19
in Chevrolet dealerships dealership were advertising offers like
36:01
trade in your Volkswagen diesel for a clean Chevy diesel. Are you with me? Is
36:05
this not anti-competitive? No. Can you say that?
36:11
It is, right? Then how can they say that?
36:14
Huh? I know, but it's still against the law.
36:18
You can't say say it like that. So, here's a quick correction. Chevro did
36:22
not say that. The dealerships were saying that, right?
36:31
They didn't say dirty clean. They said clean Chevy. I get it. But at the same
36:35
time, the company wasn't saying it. All the dealerships who had the rights to
36:39
sell all sorts of vehicles, they were saying it. Are you with me? So perhaps
36:44
Carlo was right. When you are selling a substitute, not only wait for the fact
36:48
that price falls down, not only wait for the fact that it goes out of stock,
36:52
whenever there is a scandal, it's a beautiful opportunity for you to start
36:55
selling your cars. Are you with me? Uh over here a lot of you were also perhaps
37:01
right in terms of understanding before I do go there, what what do you think
37:05
happened in the short run? Increase in sales of
37:14
increase in sales for Chevrolet. Who all who all sold?
37:20
Only Chevrolet. Only Chevrolet. Can you think of other
37:32
brands? All of them follow
37:49
all of them. Can you fix this please?
37:56
So you're precisely right. Right. At the same time, Volkswagen buyback program
38:01
that we that we were all discussing in the class right now, they had to give up
38:05
their diesel cars and Volkswagen stopped selling the diesels in the USA. They had
38:09
to stop the production of every diesel car. Are you with me? What happened in
38:14
the long run? Diesel cars never came back.
38:22
Volkswagen, they were anywhere. Diesel cars never came back. Volkswagen
38:28
had lost large amount of market share. Grand image also went for a
38:48
correct. I'm with you. But the diesel never came back.
38:58
think more double down on that 50% correct.
39:05
Are you sure? Correct. Damn right. This is the time
39:12
when EV market was booming. It was a perfect time to switch to hybrid cars.
39:18
Please don't forget the substitutes. If you want to ride on substitutes, you
39:21
have to also pick up on the trend. If your entire market, entire brand image
39:26
negative, it's spread by negativity, what you have to do is quickly change
39:29
the positioning positioning of diesel cars was no longer working out. Which
39:34
means I start looking at EV sales. Are you with me? So then Volkswagen over
39:39
here had to reposition their cars and at the same time start selling
39:44
uh EV leading models. Now I know Bupes has taught you that there's nothing
39:47
known as brand loyalty, but we did see some folkswagen customers return from
39:52
all the Chevrolet and all the Mazdas and all the Jaguars back to Volkswagen not
39:56
for the diesel cars but for the electric vehicles car with me. So let me now
40:01
again segue to the substitute what the hell am I doing in the class started off
40:05
with the demand curve talked about movements and ships suddenly started
40:09
talking about cross price elasticity started comparing price and quantity of
40:13
two products and suddenly started talking about marketing of these
40:16
products. What is happening over here? You were
40:21
very right to tell me that a Chevrolet Cruz and a Jetta are not substitutes.
40:27
But in this scandal, in this unique opportunity, the company came out, took
40:32
their product, which was Chevrolet Cruise, broke it down into two parts.
40:37
What were the two parts? Number one, point of
40:41
what do I mean by point of par? Oh, the same similarities. Par means same.
40:47
What happens over here? I looked at the Jetta Jetta was going for a toss. What
40:53
did cruise do? Find out all the features that were matching with Jetta and tell
40:57
them you know what your Jetta did this my Cruise also does this. Are you with
41:02
me? So in the short run people were comfortable and they started moving to
41:05
Chevrolet because Chevrolet showed point of par. Chevrolet also was offering very
41:10
good buyback programs. Don't worry we are here. We'll just take the money and
41:13
give you the car at the door. You won't even feel like you've lost the car. Are
41:17
you with me? In the longer run, that's where the trouble came. Why? Because
41:23
Volkswagen was coming back. So, how do I ensure that these people continue to
41:28
stay in Chevrolet? This is where the second part comes in called point of
41:32
differentiation. You start telling the people of
41:36
Chevrolet that you know what, of course, we are just like Volkswagen. All the
41:40
similarities are here, but these features, this is how we are better. Are
41:44
you with me? This is what all of you are doing in your drop shipping as well.
41:49
Of course, the very first thing that you're showing out is see we are similar
41:53
like any other brand but look at our quality it's better. Look at our
41:56
shipping it's better. Look at our price point it's better. So which means what
42:01
I'm doing in the class right now is I've told you when you are working with
42:05
substitutes you have two parts pop point of par of differentiation. You
42:11
decide when do you want to fight on what I never said go do pop first and then do
42:17
p. It's on you. You want to do p first pop later on you. You want to do pop
42:24
first p later on you. You never want to do pop. You always want to do p on you.
42:31
Are you understanding? What I've done in the class is I've told you economists
42:35
have substitutes price and quantity all that drama. in the real world. Break it
42:40
down into pop and pod and see when you want to use it. Are you with me? Right.
42:47
With this, I wrap up substitutes. This is what I meant with substitutes. Thank
42:51
you so much, Roit. And that's your marketeteers dilemma. You need to see
42:56
what you want to do. Understood? Okay. Now, let me segue into
43:01
compliments. If substitutes are goods such that price
43:07
of A goes up, quantity of B goes up positively. What are compliments then?
43:15
Just the opposite, isn't it? We talked about Tesla, right?
43:20
Yeah, we talked about the charging stations,
43:24
right? What did we talk there? Somebody can summarize for me. Yes.
43:46
Are we aligned with that? So this is my final
43:50
drop over here. When you're talking about compliments, substitutes, I told
43:54
you your drop shipping goods can be substitutes combination of P and P.
43:59
will come further and teach us both these instruments better. But when I'm
44:04
talking about compliments, you can break down compliments into two parts.
44:09
Number one, industry specific compliments. Number two, company
44:15
specific compliments. Now, what the hell do I mean? Uh
44:19
let's say Brandon over here is saying that u oh guy I want to create
44:25
a product uh which is complimentary to the alcoholic beverage industry. I'm
44:30
like okay Brandon what's your product? He's like you know what Gh I found out
44:33
this uh drink which you can add to vodka for
44:41
example and if you add it to vodka all the negative health effects of vodka
44:46
would go away. Yeah, just go away like you've got
44:52
market for that. Come back. So what is happening over here? All the vodka
44:58
drinkers suddenly get very happy because now vodka has become at least not that
45:02
of a health bad health drink with me also at the same time people who weren't
45:07
drinking vodka they get happy because the all the ill benefits have gone away
45:11
and I get attracted to the drink as well. What he has done over here has
45:16
made sure that only can be used with vodka. Give me a brand of vodka.
45:21
Absolute for example. So Brandon has made a product which will make sure that
45:26
his complimentary product can only be used with absolute. This is known as a
45:32
company specific compliment. Just like how Tesla decided that the battery
45:38
station can only be used with Tesla. That is exactly that. Making that my
45:47
company people can only use it. Also positioning exclusivity like that. Which
45:53
means when you're working with company specific compliments, you are working
45:58
with exclusivity. You are working with FOMO. You are working with creating a
46:03
strong loyalist or exclusive club. Are you with me? My whole point is know your
46:09
product. Know how to position it. If that is company specific, then Brandon
46:14
comes back three years later to me or two years later to me and Brandon says,
46:17
"Ga, I think I can help the entire industry." I said, "How can you help the
46:22
entire industry?" He said, "Ga, I've changed the blueprint of my product, not
46:27
just absolute, any other drink, any other whiskey brand, you guys can help
46:33
me. Any other drinking brand, people can use my liquid." Understanding? So now
46:39
the entire industry has sort of elevated. This is known as industry
46:45
specific compliment which means not just absolute but all the drinking companies
46:51
all the alcoholic companies are benefited. Are you with me? So that is
46:55
an entire positively positive brand movement in terms of
46:59
cleaning up the image. Earlier only absolute had that exclusive club
47:03
exclusivity broke down the moment he repositioned himself as industry
47:07
specific compliment and the entire industry elevated. This is my point to
47:12
you for people who will be participating in the case studies.
47:17
Your positioning statement can be whether you should make two products
47:22
which are mutually exclusive which means entire industry can use it or should you
47:28
only sorry only your company can use it or should you produce a good that the
47:32
entire industry can use it. That is it. Economics teaches you substitutes and
47:38
complements with definition. Price goes up, quantity falls down, price goes up,
47:43
quantity goes up. My job should have ended there. But at college of business,
47:48
you better know how to mix it with the right marketing. You're working with
47:52
substitutes, good to go. Break it down into pop pod. You're working with
47:56
compliments, good to go. Break it down into company specific compliments or
48:01
industry specific compliments, which is rather working with exclusivity or
48:06
working with elevating the entire industry. Are you with me?
48:11
Are you sure? Understanding? No. Okay. Can you take a five minutes break? Once
48:17
you do take a five minutes break, I will come back to teaching last class. Last
48:21
class is elasticity and we'll go ahead with the applications. Okay, understood.
48:26
Come back at 11:15. I will
48:32
What time does the class get over? No, my I started 10:15 10:30 started but
48:46
I started late Okay, let's start.
55:07
Come, come. That's okay.
55:29
Sit down. Half an hour more. We're going back with
55:34
the concept taught in the previous class. Quick revision and once we
55:38
revised we'll head straight to the applications. How do you define
55:42
elasticity I know with the formula Martin? What is
55:48
the formula? Julian or Julian? Julian or Julian?
56:02
Julian. Okay. Julian, tell me what is price elasticity.
56:08
Look at the smile and the twingum.
56:12
Okay, the jingum comes out. You can eat it. Tell me now what is price
56:16
elasticity? Oh, I'm so sorry. Now you throw it away.
56:21
Tell me what is price elasticity? Mhm. That's just price change. That's
56:35
only price change. That's only percentage change in price. That's 50%
56:39
of the formula. You want to try any of you? I forgot.
56:45
It's in Nicholas. H tell me what is price elasticity?
56:53
I just said for the complimentary goods, right?
56:58
No, I know you guys know. No, I'm not going to ask you guys. That one also
57:01
knows. That one's not going to raise his hand. This one also knows. Not going to
57:05
raise his hand. Raise your Put your hands down.
57:09
What is this dance going on in my class? Patrick, you want to try?
57:13
Yeah. Is it change on quantity?
57:21
That's half the formula. Ah, got it. So percentage change in
57:27
quantity divided by percentage change in price with me simple question all of you
57:36
tell me instantly when price increases revenue
57:40
increases decreases
57:46
it depends what elasticity it increases no what is
57:51
the formula of revenue price times quantity
57:58
So quantity goes down when price goes up.
58:04
I'm saying such simple concepts. Revenue is price into quantity. As price goes
58:09
up, revenue goes up. Isn't it?
58:22
So this is where most of the class is saying o this is where most of the class
58:28
is saying depends and every time I say depends you say
58:33
which means we need to figure it out. Very simply speaking folks I also know
58:38
that revenue is nothing but equal to price into quantity.
58:44
I'm saying price goes up by 1 percentage with me.
58:50
Quantity will fall or increase? Quantity will fall or increase.
58:58
When price goes up, quantity will. If something gets more expensive, will you
59:03
buy more? No. Very very rare circumstances, you will buy more.
59:08
Generally, it will decrease. So which means quantity should fall down
59:13
by how much? Yes one
59:23
we are looking at from a demand perspective. Demand I'm talking about
59:27
price elasticity of demand. Very simple. Yeah I'm saying price goes up by 1%.
59:32
Quantity falls by how much? It can be anything.
59:38
It depends. So when it falls down only a little bit let's say.1%
59:46
2% what happens to my revenue similarly when price increases by 1
59:54
percentage and quantity falls by more than 1 percentage what happens to my
59:59
revenue so which means every time you say price
1:00:05
increase will lead to revenue increase is incorrect.
1:00:09
It depends how your quantity is responding. Are you understanding? That
1:00:13
is why most of the class over here or some people in the class is saying are
1:00:16
saying that GAMA depends upon elasticity.
1:00:20
Which also means whether you can increase price or whether you can
1:00:26
decrease price for your own drop shipping good or any D2C good depends
1:00:31
upon how elastic or how inelastic the good is. Are you with me? Let's go over
1:00:37
this one last time. Let me break it down as to what I'm seeing.
1:00:44
Let's say I'm talking about a product which is very
1:00:50
elastic. I clearly wrote elastic. I need not
1:01:00
explain myself. If a good is elastic, it is just like the rubber band. So if my
1:01:05
price goes up by 1 percentage quantity falls by by a lot has to be more than 1
1:01:12
percentage. So which means the good is elastic. Hence I say I need not explain
1:01:17
myself. Are you with me? Very clearly good is elastic perhaps just like your
1:01:22
drop shipping product. If you end up increasing the price of your product way
1:01:28
too much we clearly saw what outrage happens on your WhatsApp group.
1:01:34
price of the product was too much. I need not even explain the outrage that
1:01:39
hop happens. Yeah. So, which means that the price
1:01:43
goes up. You start looking at alternatives like AliExpress was one
1:01:48
recommendation given. Coming back sometimes you help you help
1:01:54
teach my lesson so well. What can I say? But then coming back if at all your
1:02:01
product is as elastic as some of the examples of your drop shipping products
1:02:06
which means you will come back to me Gara I am so surprised or so
1:02:11
underconident can you tell me should I increase my price or gimma
1:02:19
should I decrease my price I said perfect let's see let's see how that
1:02:23
happens for your good guys if you increase your price by one percentage
1:02:29
what happens to a quantity decreases by
1:02:34
one more than one give me an example five can I for this class say 20
1:02:39
percentage it is still elastic you can say five you can say 20 as long it's
1:02:44
more than one so just for understanding over here let's say it falls down by
1:02:50
5%age that also fine look over here price rose but quantity fell way too
1:02:56
much what happens to my revenue. Come back again. I decide gimma this
1:03:03
time I want to reduce my price by 1 percentage. What will happen to my
1:03:07
quantity upward by 5 percentage? What will happen
1:03:12
to my revenue? Which means deciding on a pricing
1:03:19
strategy depends upon the relative positioning of your product. If it is
1:03:24
elastic, don't you dare increase your price. You will lose your market share.
1:03:29
Your WhatsApp example is a great answer. Are you understanding? But at the same
1:03:34
time, if you cut the price, you can expect higher revenue.
1:03:40
Once you do come to India term for your D2C business, we will conduct something
1:03:45
called uh flea market. Flea market. We'll make you set up stalls around in
1:03:51
India, right? and we will go experiment with your product. If at all you end up
1:03:56
finding an elastic product, I will ask you to start with the higher price and
1:04:00
then consequently keep on skimming so that you may expect higher revenue. Are
1:04:05
you with me? Please understand objective of the classroom has to be revenue
1:04:12
maximization. If revenue maximization is not your
1:04:16
strategy, this entire economics breaks down. You know why am I saying that? You
1:04:22
know why am I saying that? A lot of you
1:04:30
may come back to me and say that Gara you are teaching us revenue maximization
1:04:37
strategies. I said yes I am. Go back to your demand curve. You are saying GMA
1:04:49
for elastic products this happens. Which part of my line is elastic?
1:04:56
Which part of my line is elastic? What's the elasticity exactly at the
1:05:04
midpoint? Minus one. I said break it down into two
1:05:11
equal. You guys don't revise anything. At the center point, my elasticity was
1:05:15
equal to one or minus one. I removed the minus sign for ease.
1:05:20
Are you with me? And elastic is any part where elasticity is very high or more
1:05:25
than one. So which part is it? The upper part. Upper part.
1:05:31
Okay. Very good. This part is therefore known as elastic portion of demand
1:05:38
curve. It's a beautiful, beautiful segment of a demand curve. You want to
1:05:42
know why? At this point of time, you cut any price, what happens to your revenue?
1:05:50
When you cut your price, what happens to your revenue? Increases. At the same
1:05:55
time, when you cut your price, number of people buying your product also
1:06:01
increases. Right now, it's not seeming very stupid. You think, what is she
1:06:05
saying? Of course, when price falls down, more people will come to the
1:06:08
market. That's probably probably the reason why revenue is going up. Are you
1:06:12
with me? Let me teach you the other part. Then look at inelastic segments.
1:06:22
When you're working with an inelastic segment, here also you can increase
1:06:26
price. And when you do increase price by 1 percentage, what happens to your
1:06:31
quantity? reduces by less maybe hardly maybe 0.5
1:06:39
what happens to my revenue increases.
1:06:43
Similarly, when my price decreases, let's say by 1 percentage, what happens
1:06:49
to my quantity? Increases but only by.5%,
1:06:54
what happens to my revenue? Do you see how it is just the opposite
1:07:01
here? For elasticity, if the point is to
1:07:06
increase revenue, please you decrease price.
1:07:11
However, if you're working with inelastic products, if you end up
1:07:15
decreasing price, you also hurt your revenue. Are you with me? Okay. Now,
1:07:22
here comes the weird part here where the entrepreneur
1:07:27
gets very fidgety. When the entrepreneur when she is
1:07:32
working or when they are working on the top end of the demand curve, they are
1:07:35
okay with it because when they cut price, revenue goes up. Right? When I
1:07:40
cut price, revenue goes up. With me? Also, when I cut price from, for
1:07:46
example, here to here, number of people also go up. So, market share is also
1:07:51
going up. Are you with me? However, when I'm working with the inelastic portion
1:07:56
of demand curve, the top part here, if I end up cutting my price from here to
1:08:03
here, I clearly see my revenue going down. Can you see that? At the same
1:08:09
time, even though I cut my price, revenue goes down, but market share is
1:08:15
going up. So, it becomes a tradeoff for the
1:08:19
entrepreneur to think between people or footfall or market share for your
1:08:24
company and revenue. Are you able to visualize that? Should I
1:08:30
go slow? I have two nods. Rest of you are not
1:08:35
saying anything. Is this clear?
1:08:39
Share one you don't understand okay revenue did you understand revenue is
1:08:43
clear right okay this is elastic portion and inelastic
1:08:50
portion elastic what do you mean by you that was entire
1:08:56
last class taught were you not there in the last class
1:09:02
I taught the entire thing last class We did the entire BMW example. Were you
1:09:12
there in my last class? So if you miss it and I also gave an extra class in the
1:09:18
evening. You were not there as well. You remember the BMW example. In the BMW
1:09:24
example, we said that the graph is downward sloping. In the middle it was
1:09:30
one. This was infinity. You remember when we were cutting the
1:09:35
price of BMW, large number of people ended up going to
1:09:39
the BMW store to buy it, right? So heavily elastic. Hence I said top part
1:09:45
is elastic, bottom part is inelastic. With me BMW example, no, I'm saying a
1:09:52
simple demand curve. Simple linear demand curve. Very simple.
1:10:00
my entire class sweetheart one and a half hours. I can't do it for your
1:10:03
absence. You got to go back revise the I broke it down bit by bit. I made sure
1:10:11
people learn in the class. You revise I'll help you out. Other person Navia
1:10:16
come back. Are you with me when I say well you have
1:10:20
to be with me because it was last class. Also the BMW example I hope that makes
1:10:24
you call back memory. This was heavily elastic.
1:10:28
When the price is $15, Navia, do you see how there are five customers?
1:10:35
When the price is cut down to $12, do you see how there are 10 customers? So,
1:10:40
can I say share of people went up or customer footfall went up with me? In
1:10:45
the elastic portion, when I cut my price, what happens to my revenue?
1:10:50
Increases. So which means in the elastic portion revenue increases at the same
1:10:56
time number of people also increases. Are you with me? Okay let's come to the
1:11:02
inelastic portion. When I work to the inelastic portion na come back when the
1:11:08
price is $10 do you see there are now 15 people and when the price is $5 do you
1:11:16
see how there are 25 people? Can you see n went up? Are you with me? What? There
1:11:23
is a price decrease and when there is a price decrease, what happens to my
1:11:27
revenue? Revenue decreases. So this becomes a tradeoff for the
1:11:32
entrepreneur here. Over here it's good to go when I'm talking about price cuts.
1:11:38
All of you with me Carlo. Yeah.
1:12:26
I had broken down my last class minute by minute.
1:12:43
BMW example we gave to teach you that today's class I told you would be
1:12:47
application do you see how from simple elasticity
1:12:52
I'm teaching revenue maximization strategies so now tell me all of you
1:12:59
if you are in the you are not even there don't even say but over
1:13:07
Yes, I'm saying when it is inelastic portion
1:13:15
price falls by 1 percentage. That's okay. I cut the price just for an
1:13:20
example I gave him. That was just an example. I also understand that this
1:13:25
should have been 4.5. I get it. It was an example. Okay. Also
1:13:31
price cut can be anything. I'm taking 1% for ease. Okay. Very uh Aish
1:13:44
what do you mean? This is data.
1:13:51
This is any product it may go up. You can pretty
1:13:55
much take 1.2%age also. I have taken 5% over here as an example. If you're that
1:14:02
uncomfortable, you can take 1.2%age to be more real world.
1:14:08
In the dieselgate example, clearly despite the shock, if the price had gone
1:14:12
up for those Volkswagen cars, if at all, there would have been a huge fall in
1:14:16
quantity. Understand? So maybe 5%.
1:14:23
Maybe 5% matters. Okay. When I say 1%, it's for ease of reference. You can
1:14:28
multiply by five in the denominator and you'll get the answer.
1:14:33
It is nothing but percentage change in quantity by percentage change in price.
1:14:37
In the class again and again I'm saying percentage change in price is one. You
1:14:41
can assume five. It's just plugging in the formula. Doesn't matter. Okay. Is
1:14:48
this clear? Okay. In your business you want to go ahead with price increase.
1:14:53
Should you be in the elastic or inelastic?
1:14:57
You want to go ahead with price increase. Should it be elastic or
1:15:00
inelastic? Inelastic because here your revenue
1:15:05
increases with me. And similarly, if you want to decrease price, where should you
1:15:10
be? Elastic. So now you see why I'm breaking it down in terms of
1:15:14
understanding where you are on the demand curve.
1:15:18
So folks, when you have these four channels written in front of you, what
1:15:23
if I say how much time will you take to write down these four lines?
1:15:30
1 minute. Anybody else? It'll take a minute to write down the four chains.
1:15:35
How about I improve your time from 1 minute to 20 seconds
1:15:44
with me? What if I say you can solve it in 20
1:15:48
seconds? Let's look at it. Let's understand why
1:15:51
am I saying that over here I'm relying on your mental
1:16:10
picture taking capability. What do I mean by that?
1:16:15
This is your demand curve. This you remember 1,000 times I've made in the
1:16:20
class. Okay? Which means I want you to remember the only thing I'm saying
1:16:25
remember otherwise I've been saying common sense till now. Please remember a
1:16:30
graph which looks like a mountain.
1:16:39
This is your demand curve. Let's say we talk about a graph that looks like a
1:16:44
mountain. That's all. Will you remember this? It's just a mountain. And for
1:16:49
people who want to understand where the mountain is coming from, happy to sit
1:16:51
with you for 2 minutes after class and teach you the math. But for BMT, I'm not
1:16:56
saying math. AI students should stay back and people who are interested
1:16:59
should stay back. Should stay back. I also said that you can break down the
1:17:03
demand curve into center. So over here elasticity is equal to one, right? Top
1:17:10
end is elastic or inelastic? Elastic. So elasticity is greater than
1:17:15
one and this should be elasticity less than one. Are you with me? This was
1:17:21
nothing but price. This is nothing but quantity.
1:17:26
When I draw the mountain remember this is nothing but the revenue that I have
1:17:32
been screaming in the class since beginning
1:17:35
with me. And this is also same to same quantity.
1:17:40
Now look at the beauty. Your entire
1:17:45
1 minute breaks down here guys. Can you see this is the inelastic portion
1:17:52
when I increase my price from here to here. Can you see how my revenue
1:18:00
increases from here to here with me at the same do we have more
1:18:07
color pens? Give me a red color pen. Similarly, do you see
1:18:18
that when I am reducing the price from here to here, my revenue also falls from
1:18:25
here to here. I repeat in the elastic portion when I'm cut increasing my price
1:18:33
from here to here my revenue falls with me and similarly when I cut my
1:18:42
prices from here to here clearly my revenue
1:18:47
increases did you see how your time is only 20
1:18:51
seconds now no still
1:18:58
Then how much? Okay, I explained so it took time. I
1:19:04
promise when you go back your time to finish and come down to a decision will
1:19:08
be faster. Are you with me? So now it is on you whether you want to make four
1:19:14
lines and do price increase and revenue increase or you want to go back and
1:19:19
consult to this graph. Understood? take the next two minutes in doing an
1:19:25
in-class application. This was theory I needed
1:19:31
that is unit ah very good this elasticity is equal to one is called
1:19:37
unit elastic which corresponds to the maximum revenue are you with me so which
1:19:44
means I'm coming back is is this chart clear or this entire
1:19:51
line clear all four lines anybody any doubt Sure.
1:20:19
Okay. So, which means now this diagram should not be weird to you.
1:20:25
There are two ways to go about it. Either you make four lines. Price
1:20:28
increase, price decrease, price increase, price decrease for elasticity
1:20:32
or inelasticity. You want to make those four chains. You make those four chains.
1:20:36
Or you want to use this diagram to consult for revenue maximization
1:20:41
strategies. Then you use this diagram. Choose any one. Yes, Patrick.
1:20:50
for any business is my pricing goal putting price elasticity equal to one
1:20:55
only true if revenue maximization is the strategy
1:21:00
in no real life for example for this business 4.5 million units correspond to
1:21:07
maximum revenue this point Patrick may not correspond to maximum profits
1:21:14
because I don't know what my cost structure looks here if my cost
1:21:18
structure shows very high cost costs for this particular unit then my then I will
1:21:22
be bleeding money revenue will be maximum but profits may be very negative
1:21:28
so which means if revenue maximization of a strategy yes they should go ahead
1:21:32
with 4.5 units when you are starting up or when you
1:21:38
have made your preede money or first round of money your investor is also
1:21:42
looking at how many sales you have made what's your revenue revenue what's the
1:21:46
company footfall how many customers are there for that this becomes good. But
1:21:51
the moment your second round, third round comes and when to show money that
1:21:55
you're making profits, quarterly profits are going up. You can't consult on just
1:21:59
this. You also need to look at cost curves with me. So cost curves will come
1:22:04
with time. Right now learn the revenue maximization curves. There was a point a
1:22:09
question at the back. Yeah. Any question? No. Okay. This is
1:22:14
clear. Take. Yeah. No, not necessarily for profit
1:22:22
maximization may does not mean revenue maximization doesn't
1:22:37
that is why this is a very medium-term analysis where I would look at quarterly
1:22:41
profits quarterly revenue quarterly sales daily becomes difficult
1:22:46
Okay, good to go. Okay, moving on. Application case. Your cafe
1:22:54
chain notices the price of the cappuccino falling or sorry rather
1:22:58
increasing from 1.2 to 1.4 and number of coffee cups also dropped.
1:23:05
Is it a good thing or a bad thing? What I mean to say the manager is unsure to
1:23:10
tell me whether price increase was a good decision or not. Take two minutes
1:23:15
analyze in the class whether the pricing has been done right or not.
1:23:20
Take two minutes. It's a good decision. Why do you say so?
1:23:43
revenue has increased. Okay, brilliant. Come back.
1:23:50
What are these people telling me is that GMA don't waste our time. You know why?
1:23:56
Because Ve was like GMA I didn't need your elasticity and elasticity. You
1:23:59
wasted my time doing all that. You know what that guy did? That guy simply said,
1:24:05
okay, price is $1.2 $2 P1. Second price is, can the murmuring please stop? I'll
1:24:14
finish it up in 2 minutes. The next price is $1.4.
1:24:20
Quantity one is how much? How much is quantity two?
1:24:27
Are you with me? Okay. I don't need this elasticity non- elasticity. What
1:24:32
nonsense? She's just wasting our time. Don't say yes, Yash.
1:24:36
You can simply calcate revenue which is P1 into Q1. How much is 1.2 into 500?
1:24:45
600. And Gha just look at the new revenue
1:24:50
which is 1.4 into 450 which is looking at these numbers. GMA the
1:24:55
manager did a very good job to increase the price. Are you with me?
1:25:05
And that's okay. Revenue maximization is a strategy right now. That's okay. Where
1:25:09
did elasticity come into picture? Did you need elastity? No. And GAMA has
1:25:16
wasted one hour of your life teaching in city. What nonsense, isn't it? I agree.
1:25:21
Weber was saying
1:25:33
thank you. What he's saying for You are right. He was random
1:25:39
or she was random. They simply increased the price out of just common sense and
1:25:45
asked you just say whether it's good or bad. You guys multiplied and told me
1:25:49
revenue maximization. Good to go. What you guys can now do further is become a
1:25:55
consultant and tell that manager by how much more can we increase the price.
1:26:00
That's the beauty of elasticity. What do I mean by that?
1:26:05
Thank you very much. You have to increase that such that elasticity is
1:26:09
equal to one because that's where your revenue is maximized. Can you guys
1:26:14
simply help me calculate elastity for now? What is percentage change in
1:26:19
quantity by percentage change in price? This is Q2US Q1.
1:26:27
450 - 500 by 500 divided by 1.4
1:26:34
- 1.2 by 1.2. Can somebody tell me the answer
1:26:42
to 1.6? Now tell me the entire answer. 0.
1:26:52
You do this mentally. You did it mentally.
1:26:58
Answer is 6. Is 6 elastic or inelastic? inelastic in the inelastic portion
1:27:06
should I increase my price revenue goes up she's saying 6 perhaps the number is
1:27:14
somewhere here because I know this is zero and this is one so perhaps the
1:27:19
number is here can I recommend to the consultant or to the manager to increase
1:27:24
price further to take it all the way to elasticity equal to one that's the
1:27:29
beauty of elasticity you can recommend a new pricing strategy
1:27:34
if I repeat if revenue maximization strategy is the answer. Are you with me?
1:27:41
Which means you need to know how to derive the equation of a line.
1:27:47
Are you with me? Now you know
1:27:55
you need to figure out the math to figure out. Understood?
1:28:08
I clearly said this is nothing but the midpoint of yaxis. This is nothing but
1:28:15
the midpoint of sorry this is nothing but the midpoint of x-axis. This is
1:28:19
midpoint of y ais and this is what is your homework is to go back and find
1:28:23
that midpoint and recommend that pricing strategy.
1:28:27
Folks, what I have done in the class is broken down this into three case prompts
1:28:35
for you to understand what should be the chain of thought. Right? Go back home
1:28:41
and revise. If you don't revise, you will forget.
1:28:44
Just just 20 minutes revise. It's going to be anonymous. And lastly,
1:28:55
there are two ways we can go around it. I will make the questions live. I have
1:29:00
taught you everything, right? Case study goes live. I think you can do it. Why?
1:29:07
Because I've broken down the case study into these questions.
1:29:17
The same You had a pre regular solar power. I've
1:29:24
taken that pre and broken it down into three four questions. I will let's do
1:29:30
one thing. Let's not go fast. I will do the case study the next class. But I'll
1:29:35
also make the questions live. Solve it and come and we can engage better.
1:29:41
Thank you very much. That was my time. This was a technical class. Please
1:29:45
revise and come. are very important. Revise and come.

How do consumers behave during recessions? Can your business actually flourish in a recession?
17/09/2025 | 12:00 PM - 01:30 PM
Dr. Garima Chaklader
0:00
take an exam. Yeah.
0:04
Is that really that important? Yes,
0:06
the examination certainly is that important.
0:12
I'm alive for my subject. I make the rules. For Teta College of Business
0:15
also, I make the rules. But in in line with other professors in this one, no,
0:20
don't worry about it. If you want to exit and write your name, I'll really
0:23
appreciate it. Did I start the game?
0:29
No, no, I didn't start the game. Can we not start the game? Can we go? Who
0:33
started the game? But you can see the cow members at the
1:04
Thank you very much. The diamonds and the triangle in my class. I don't know
1:10
who you are, but I hope you find yourself and study economics. If not, oi
1:17
calm down. Okay. So, I'm hoping law of demand is clear. This was just the
1:23
beginning. This is just warming up. Questions are easy. If you followed last
1:28
class, you should be able to do. Let's move on to the next question.
1:32
Yeah. Who's on the leaderboard though? Like
1:36
who was the fastest? Jagat.
1:41
You cannot what? I don't mind.
1:53
I don't mind. I don't mind. Can we start again? Wait, wait, wait,
1:58
wait, wait, wait. How do we do this?
2:11
How do you end it? I go back.
2:27
Okay. Hi. Hi. Hello.
2:34
Okay. That doesn't work. Starting again. Write your names. Stop whistling. You
2:41
know the first answer which means whosoever answers the fastest is on the
2:44
leaderboard. Capitalize on this opportunity
2:48
but the Wi-Fi I have no I can't control Wi-Fi I can
2:52
control this. Maybe you want to switch to your 4G 5G network. I'm not sure if
2:56
you all are ready. Can we begin? Okay with your real names not numbers
3:01
top right. Let's see who can be each other this
3:04
time. What is this?
3:34
I was singing for myself. Where's the music?
3:41
Sound of Max. sound.
3:56
43 students are in and let's go it. Let's do it.
4:02
Top right. Start. Shut up. Get your phones out.
4:24
Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
4:34
I know he did. Come back. Is my camera Is my mic working?
4:42
Will it work? Okay. No. No. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Shut
4:47
up. Look at the board. There are still those two people.
4:53
No matter what, how many times you teach them, even give them the question paper
4:58
and the answer, they are still like that. You, my boy.
5:03
Okay. Awesome. Let's go to the next question please. But I'm law of demand
5:07
is perfectly understood. I'm very glad. Thank you God. Next. Click on next
5:12
please. Lucer.
5:18
Fernando. Where are you? Okay. Gotham is here. Steve is there.
5:24
Sam is where Sam. Okay. Awesome.
5:30
Next question please. Okay. Come back. Come back yesterday.
6:06
For how many minutes and hours did I scream next to your ears that price only
6:12
leads to movements along the curve? Non-pric factors. Any other factor which
6:19
is not spelled as P R I C E. Any other factor non-pric factors lead to shift in
6:27
demand curve. Isn't it?
6:30
Yeah. And stop swearing. I'll throw you out now. I told you last time also.
6:33
Okay, good. Go ahead. The first option therefore can't be the option. Now to
6:38
make your lives better, simpler, easier, absolutely next to spoon feed you. I
6:43
also wrote substitute in the bracket so that your eyes could fall on that.
6:48
And yesterday only we discussed how substitutes and compliments can lead to
6:52
shifts in demand curve. Right? May God help you. May God help me more. Let's
6:57
see who's winning this round. Okay, Fernando is here. Akanch is here.
7:05
Maria is here. Where's Shraan? And Nikil. Okay. Oh, you are Nikil. I mean,
7:10
you wrote Nick, so I know you as Nick now. Okay, cool. Next question. Oh,
7:15
Dwanchi is the highest climber. Awesome. Go for it. It's easy.
7:38
Shut up. Bless the go. No, it's my mistake. It's my mistake.
8:01
You listen to the comment I'm making. It's my mistake that I've given this
8:07
question and this option to this audience, to this class. Absolute
8:10
idiots. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. I know you will
8:15
still buy that designer sneaker even if the price goes up.
8:19
Thank you, G. I like you more now. Why are you sold?
8:24
Why soul? I got it right.
8:29
Can you please scream that salt is a necessity good unless you
8:33
don't season your food. Thank you.
8:37
I was like there's so much salt. Come back. Absolute buffoons. Monkeys.
8:43
Shut up now. I'm going to take this line and exactly copy what Lucia just said.
8:48
Unless you season your food, salt is not the answer. Also, I was very careful
8:53
asking this question. Which good is the most likely? Most likely next to your
8:59
designer sneaker. You have salt. Obviously, if the price of salt goes up,
9:04
it's that is
9:07
you can live without salt. But not those designer sneakers. jump
9:12
out of that fourth floor right now. Okay, next. Let's see who's winning
9:16
though. Who got that question right?
9:20
Kan Dit. Where is Dit? Where's Zit? Dit is there. That's Zit. Yeah. Poa.
9:32
Deanchi. Harsha. Where is Dwanchi? Okay. Okay. Next question please.
9:40
Next question. Yeah.
9:54
My wife. Okay.
10:13
Okay. Hey. Hi. Unless I lose the discipline in the class, I'll get the
10:17
game off. I'll turn it off then. Discipline shouldn't go out. You can
10:21
have fun, but not not at the cost of discipline. Look at the board.
10:28
Okay. Can we get the screen off, Israel?
10:32
The price elasticity of demand is two. Is it elastic or inelastic?
10:37
Elastic. So which means that if I have a demand curve which is downward sloping
10:42
where should I mark elastity equals to two top end bottom end
10:47
top end so I must be having a point where elasticity equals to two then I
10:52
taught you that there was a mountain thank you very much this is
10:56
nothing but my revenue graph now in the elastic portion if I'm increasing prices
11:02
let's say from here to here can you See how my revenue is falling?
11:11
Is it clear? So if you end up increasing your prices
11:14
when you have an elastic product, always remember Enzo. What happens? Revenue can
11:19
fall down with me. Okay, that boy gives me good content. Let's move to the next
11:23
question. Okay, who's leading the board?
11:29
I can't. Guys, there has been no change. There has been no change since last
11:34
question. Let's go to the next one. This better be right.
12:05
Okay, 70 80% of the batch is getting all the
12:10
questions right. The ones who are making a mistake, I really hope you're making
12:14
the mistake because of lack of time. This question is just the opposite of
12:18
the previous question. Yeah.
12:20
Yeah. In the elastic portion, if you are lowering the price, clearly your revenue
12:25
goes up, right? Any anybody any doubt when I'm saying these things, revenue
12:30
and elasticity? I know. Good. Let's see the leaderboard.
12:37
You want to have it out? You guys have it out?
12:40
No. Okay. Danch Paula is back. Is it you?
12:46
Yeah, that's me. Okay. She's online then. She's online.
12:52
Okay. There are two polas over here. Okay. Yeah.
12:57
Next, please. Next question. It's the same.
13:31
It is the same question asked three different times and how one person can
13:35
be two times right and one time incorrect is my point over here. Same
13:40
question asked in a different format. So I'm thinking the time is catching up.
13:49
Should I stop teaching and move out? So then shut up.
13:56
It's the same same question. Elastity more than one means top end of the
14:01
demand curve. If it's the top end of the demand curve, if you reduce price, your
14:06
revenue will go up. I keep on saying always remember Enzo.
14:11
Enzo launched his product at extremely high price. People weren't buying it.
14:15
Only if he reduces the price, he will be able to get higher revenue. Are you with
14:19
me? So people who are wrong here, I'm really
14:23
thinking it's the people who are probably pressurized by time. Did I get
14:28
that right, Joseph? Joseph,
14:32
you got the question right? Okay, look at the smile. Okay, next
14:36
question, please. Gotham is back. Paula is there. Okay,
14:45
Israel is like, don't Okay, this is simple.
15:14
Who got it right? Raise your hands. Yeah.
15:17
Okay. What happened? Okay. Are you targeted? What happened?
15:23
Why did the other po people get it wrong?
15:29
Should we go step by step? No. No. No.
15:32
So, you know the answer. No. No. I didn't understand.
15:35
You don't. Elasticity is 0.5. Is it elastic or
15:41
inelastic? Inelastic. Bottom and top end.
15:47
Is this clear? Yeah. So over here if you end up
15:50
increasing your prices what happens to your revenue.
15:59
Yeah. At one exactly at one. Why? Because
16:05
you're increasing price by 1 percentage. Quantity exactly decreases by 1
16:09
percentage. So the effect cancels out. Hence revenue remains the same.
16:14
Fair. So it's basically concepts are clear.
16:16
The time is killing you. Okay, that's good. Next question.
16:22
Can I ask a question? About to start. Yeah, ask
16:26
if it doesn't make sense.
16:34
It'll have no effect. So if you end up already if you're at the center of the
16:38
demand curve, yeah, it doesn't make a difference. It
16:41
can make difference in profit per unit. It will not make difference in profit
16:45
per unit also, but it'll end up having an impact on customer footfall. People
16:49
coming to your business, people getting to know about your business. If you're
16:52
able to achieve that at no loss of revenue, very good for your business.
16:57
Let's say you cut the price, demand goes up, no change in revenue, but demand has
17:02
gone up. So, more people get to know about you, more people buy your product.
17:06
So, there is no change in revenue, yet people visit your store more. Nothing
17:10
like it. Best point ever. Yeah, because I guess there's more
17:13
demand but they can't buy they buy because price is falling down
17:20
they increase the price that's opposite of course if you
17:22
increase the price then fall in demand people exit also but no change in
17:26
revenue yeah but that way there's more demand
17:30
people there's we like latent demand you create a lot of latent demand because
17:34
the price is higher what is latent demand
17:38
lat demand that people that want to have it but can't afford it that price
17:42
I You see that lat that's called hidden demand. Latent demand means something
17:46
that's going on at the background. That's okay. But there's going to be no
17:49
change in the revenue that you can visualize here. Current revenue.
17:53
You when you talk about latent demand that's expected revenue.
17:56
Yes. Right.
17:57
You can increase that. You can increase that
18:01
when you increase the price because you baba
18:03
if you're here if you end up increasing price here your
18:07
revenue will fall. As simple as that.
18:12
If it is exactly at the unit elastic exactly 1% then I agree no change in
18:17
demand then you can figure out your lat latent demand hidden demand that's fine.
18:21
Yeah as long as you're at the elastity equals to one only.
18:25
Yeah. Okay. Next question please. That's okay. Next question.
18:57
Okay. Okay. The ones who are saying no.
18:59
No, no, no. I I tried to click the blue line, but then when I clicked it,
19:05
oh no. Oh, no. in the class in the class if you've got it right most
19:12
of you have got it right ones who did not get it right I have a caselet coming
19:16
up I'll actually give you search price data today and you'll figure out
19:20
something about elastity right next question please
19:28
next question let's just This is Thank God. Thank God. Next
19:55
question is I'll move on like a speed of light. So they're understanding in my
19:59
class at least. Okay, do this one. Last question.
20:29
Buses and Uber are compliments. You also when you get on an Uber app,
20:36
you also get on the cab. I mean, when you get on the cab, you also get on the
20:39
bus together at the same time. How do you move?
20:42
Do you travel like this? If there are less people that go with
20:49
the Uber and also less people that go in with a bus.
20:51
No, no, no. two more I don't have time to read
20:58
of course now English is the problem and your time is the problem folks you
21:03
didn't have to read so much of English either you didn't have to look so much
21:07
at the price either whenever time is a problem over here you just look at Uber
21:12
you look at buses you know there are substitutes
21:15
and for your ease of reference I've written substitutes that's the fastest
21:19
way to answer this question okay I Think this summarizes the entire quiz.
21:25
No. Next, please. Next. Next. Next. Next. Let it be. Yes.
21:30
Yes. Ah.
21:33
This I taught you yesterday. Better be right.
21:41
Better be right. Better be right. Everyone.
21:52
The last three people, the ones who are getting false, please
21:59
read and come to my class. Yesterday I spent an entire
22:03
class teaching how Tesla positioned itself. Company specific compliments,
22:08
industry specific compliments. Well, most of you got it right, so I'm happy.
22:12
Next question, please. And that's the last one.
22:19
You guys are cheating. Okay.
22:48
How many of you got it right? Raise your hands.
22:52
Okay. The ones who got it wrong, remember Mark was working with a Mark
22:58
special liquid which we were adding in vodka and all the ill effects could go
23:03
away from the absin. Remember that? So, but then Mark's product was only helping
23:08
absent, right? And Mark's product is a complement to absent the vodka. Are you
23:13
with me? If that happens that must be a company specific compliment and only
23:19
helping that company. But when two years later Mark decided to make sure that the
23:25
product could be used by the entire industry then it became industry
23:29
specific compliment and that helped the entire industry. Correct? This statement
23:33
is perhaps true. Okay. I'm really hoping all these questions have now revised our
23:38
entire demand supply elasticity elastity revenue movements complements
23:43
substitutes and finally I mean yeah I think summarizes entirely with me. So
23:49
with the way you guys have answered I think you guys are understanding the
23:52
content good. What I will do now is move on to the next segment of economics
23:58
called firm behavior. Oh my god. Please show him the results.
24:10
I made it. [ __ ] yeah. Let's go. No. No. That's not the one I was.
24:15
That is why he wanted to first time. Who's second? Rio Dwanchi and
24:24
Shraan. Where is Shraan? Oh, you guys are out.
24:28
Oh my god. So many. Okay. Awesome. Danchi is Danchi Shraan
24:39
and there and Leo. Awesome. Chocolates for you folks late tomorrow then.
24:46
Okay. Awesome. Let's get rid of it. Let's No, no, no.
24:53
Okay. Awesome. I think I shared the entire screen. No.
25:02
But let's be sorry.
25:20
Yes. Could the annotator work? I'll start soon. I'll just check if this is
25:24
working. Attached. Okay. Awesome. It's not working.
25:33
Okay, awesome. Can I have pin rub silence
25:39
please? Thank you very much. Let's start off with the next segment of economics
25:45
called firm behavior. What I've done so far is spoken about little bit of
25:50
consumer behavior. When I was analyzing price and quantity movements, I kept
25:55
saying how is it that the person will behave, right? But a lot of you wanted
26:00
to know or perhaps want to know how can firms behave, right? How do firms
26:06
behave? They hire and fire labor. They buy capital, raw materials, right?
26:12
That's the sort of inputs you can purchase or sell. But how does a firm go
26:17
about making these decisions? That is what we will learn with this uh
26:25
class today. What do you mean by a production line data?
26:31
Why have I written production line data? What sort of data can you expect? And
26:35
when I say production line data, how many products are being made?
26:39
How many products are being made? Volume. What else?
26:43
Okay. Types of product. SKUs. What else? Time. Quantity. What do you mean by
26:48
quantity? How many produced? Okay. And what time? Which monthly, quarterly,
26:53
yearly? Harsha inventory when she says inventory
26:57
GMA how much inventory do I have in stock how much capital do you have
27:02
employed how many laborers have you have employed are you with me Paula
27:07
they have to be compliment they have to be
27:10
compliment each other so that's what so skus are they
27:13
complements when I say skus of course not but which of the products are
27:16
complements which are the product are substitutes so on and so forth for the
27:20
purpose of this class that is the real world data If I give you real world data
27:25
right now, I want to teach you some certain concepts. I will not be able to.
27:29
So I've taken the real world data and condensed it into extremely simplified
27:34
data focusing on two to three variables only. You study these three variables. I
27:40
will show you the entire functioning of a business and you'll see shortly how
27:44
what I do intend to do is give you a data set that looks like this. Can
27:50
somebody tell me what's happening in this short form data? It's actually a
27:55
very So I had thousands of labor. I've just taken 10, top 10, not top 10, the
28:00
first 10 and I've given it to you. What can you specifically see for this
28:05
data set? What can you say? Efficiency of workers.
28:11
Efficiency of workers before you can say production
28:16
performance efficiency. What's even more basic that you can look over here and
28:20
say that the output is increasing with an
28:23
increase in capital and labor. Sorry, sorry. Go Dendra, right?
28:26
No, not go on. The output is increasing with an
28:30
increase in capital and labor. Can you see any increase in capital?
28:35
No. So the capital remains same but with an increase in
28:37
full stop. Full stop. No, no. That's a good thing.
28:41
He said it exactly right. But full stop. Why full stop? Because the very first
28:45
point that Jotendra is saying is exactly damn right that my capital is constant.
28:50
How is my capital constant then? How is my output changing if capital is
28:55
constant? Because labor is increasing. Do you ever
28:59
see in any company capital being constant?
29:02
No. Are you sure? In the short
29:08
consumption. That's fine.
29:17
Whenever you start off with a business of your own, too many people are talking
29:21
to each other. I will now throw you out. Carlos,
29:25
Joseph, Montana, whatever. I forgot your name. And Paula, you four of you can
29:30
leave my class. Four of you can leave my class. Clearly,
29:34
you know way more economics than I do. I cannot be teaching if you keep on
29:39
looking at her. eyes in front. Capital is constant. Can
29:45
it ever be a reality that capital is constant? When you start your business
29:49
off, do you keep on buying capital? Do you buy a certain capital?
29:54
Right? When do you repurchase capital? When they're about to expire,
30:02
when you want to scale up, when you want to expand right what is happening over
30:08
here is Jotendra dropped the words. He said short run long run. What is short
30:13
run? In like near future, right? How much
30:19
time? 6 months.
30:21
6 months. One year.
30:22
One year. Really?
30:29
Like like but then a lot of management
30:32
accountants end up taking short run as one year and entire yearly financial
30:37
statements, profit and loss statements are made one year and they say short run
30:42
is one year. Economics that concept takes away and we
30:48
break it down and we put it back in different subjects. According to us,
30:52
shortrun is of course time dependent, but as you said, it depends on industry.
30:57
Shortun is any time period in which capital is constant and labor keeps on
31:03
changing. Are you with me? In the beginning, you don't end up buying
31:08
capital after capital. For example, if I'm setting up a bakery in this room
31:13
right now, what will I do, Max? I will place two ovens over here, buy a cash
31:18
register and get done, right? And all this raw materials and everything else
31:23
that's all I'm going to buy. Will I keep on buying ovens after ovens?
31:26
No, I will wait for some time, buy two ovens, keep on waiting for my output to
31:31
expand and see if it's doing good enough and then take a call. When do you take a
31:35
call? That data says when can you take a call to scale up? When can you take a
31:41
call to put in more capital in the business? When can you take a call to
31:44
raise money? When can you make further investments? All these four questions
31:49
can be simply seen from this 10 data points.
31:54
And you will see how I'm going to answer that. For once, I need your help. Take
31:59
out your pen and paper. I repeat, short run is any period of
32:08
time in which capital is constant. Is this shortrun data, long run data?
32:13
And in long run capital also keeps on changing and labor also keeps on
32:18
changing. In short run capital does not change and
32:24
in long run both my inputs labor and capital change. I need your help now. I
32:30
need you to take out your pen and paper and help me analyze this shortrun data
32:37
exercise in the class. Here is your data.
32:43
I want you to make a graph with output on the y-axis
32:51
and labor on the x-axis. Why am I not working with capital?
32:59
It's written. Yes. Why am I not working with capital?
33:04
It's constant. It's not changing. So, we can throw that variable out for now. So
33:09
what are the two variables left? Labor and output.
33:14
Can we make a graph with output on the yaxis and labor on the x-axis?
33:46
Done. Done. Can I see?
34:00
Jotendra is done. What is that straight line?
34:03
Labor. Baba labor on the x- axis output on the y- axis.
34:08
So we get rid of that 45°ree line. I can't see what you've done.
34:15
Uh the line is not okay. Plot the points.
34:20
Plot the points. Yeah. Yes. Draw that.
34:29
want you to draw output on the yaxis,
34:35
labor on the x-axis, and simply start plotting the points.
34:54
If you're working with your Excel, I'm happy to work with your Excel also.
34:59
That's fine. Whatever suits you.
35:08
Okay. Finish the entire point. Correct. This is correct.
35:36
Paula is done. I know it starts with M.
35:43
Steven. Steven.
35:45
Steven. Okay. Start with S. That is correct. Nishika got it right.
35:51
Maria done. That is correct.
35:59
Yes, this is on the right track. This is correct.
36:04
Little incorrect. Labor on the x-axis.
36:08
Labor on the x-axis. Ah, labor here, capital here. Labor
36:15
here, output here. Yes, you made
36:22
this correct. This is correct.
36:28
Yes, absolutely. That's the whole class. That is correct.
36:34
This is known as Do you have a curve that looks like this?
36:41
Yeah. If you go back home and simply plot
36:46
these few points that I've asked you to plot. Did you get it, Leo? You have a
36:51
plot that looks like this. Can you see that?
36:56
Okay. Okay. What's happening?
37:00
What's happening in the curve, Eden? We can see that the layer increases and
37:06
for a time that also means that the output increases. But then there's a
37:10
point where the maximum is reached at home for like two
37:14
and eight and then after that it's too much like
37:20
awesome. Would anybody want to say anything else on what Eden has said,
37:24
Leo? Maximum point of efficiency. What is
37:28
that point? How many people can you hire?
37:36
basically put that job. Can you see that?
37:41
Can you see that? Huh? I know you can hire as many as you want.
37:46
But you also have basic resources. Not everybody's Leo. Not everybody is that
37:49
rich, right? If you're not, then you might as well learn some economics here.
37:54
How many will you hire? Seven.
38:03
Okay. Okay. So, he's gone back to his economics classes, isn't it? Have you
38:07
gone back to your economics classes? What?
38:09
To tell me this or did you think on your own?
38:13
I like my This is known as a total product curve.
38:19
I don't know what you have done in your school and I know for a fact that all of
38:23
you have right now said that as my labor increases my output increases and then
38:28
after a certain point as labor increases, output starts falling down.
38:32
So if output maximization is the goal of the business, how much output will the
38:38
business create? 112. And what's the corresponding labor?
38:44
7 or eight. If I had to choose between seven or eight, how many will you
38:48
choose? Because it just cost lesser. So just
38:52
from a basic data, I'm able to see how much maximum output I can produce and
38:57
how many how many people to hire with me?
39:01
There's an entire story that you've missed out.
39:04
Entire story. I'll show you how. Imagine Gara is setting up a bakery over here,
39:10
right? And she's setting up one oven here, one oven here, and there's the
39:15
cash register. And I am producing cakes. I am baking cakes. When I have baked
39:20
cakes, I'm the only one who's working in the company. Look at the data. How many
39:24
cakes have I been able to produce? 10. Then what happens? I go ahead and
39:31
hire Maya. Maya walks into the company and then she looks at me and then look
39:36
at the number. How many are we able to produce?
39:39
30. Isn't the number weird? How weird. When Gimma was working on her own, she
39:44
was producing 10 cakes. Maya walks in. Give Fred Kristoff a little bit of a
39:51
push. Maya, do that. Just push him like that little bit. Wake up, Kristoff.
39:57
Okay. When Garba was working, there were only 10 cakes. Then Maya joined in. So
40:02
together, Gaima and Maya should have been producing 20 cakes. How did the
40:06
number become 30? Teamwork makes the dream work.
40:10
Teamwork makes the dream work. Let's see.
40:13
Power of friendship. Power of friendship.
40:16
People So Maya is way more efficient than Gimma. Did you just say that?
40:21
Did you just say that in my class together?
40:25
She's being safe right now. Playing it safe. She's playing it safe.
40:29
But probably some of you are thinking that Maya is more efficient because of
40:32
which suddenly she could add 20 more cakes in the class.
40:38
We don't know. We don't know. Then what is it then?
40:40
What's happening? Why do you think we have been able to create power of
40:43
friendship? What do you mean by power of friendship?
40:46
Synergy across departments calling specialization of labor. Maya walks in
40:53
and says, "Ga, you don't belong in the kitchen. Get the hell out." That's very
40:56
true by the way. She comes in and she takes control of the entire kitchen and
40:59
says, "Ga, perhaps you're good in communication. Go and talk to people and
41:03
get some orders." So what we're doing over here, our power of friendship in
41:07
Gen Z language, in economics language, that means specialization of labor or
41:12
division of labor, isn't it? Number one. Number two, you guys said synergy.
41:18
Let me now hire AI. A walks in now. How many cakes have we been able to produce?
41:25
60. Earlier how much was the jump? How much
41:29
was the difference? 20.
41:30
20. And now how much the difference? 30. What happened now?
41:36
You divide your work into department. So then I take care of the kitchen. She
41:41
takes care of the cash register. For example, she starts delivery.
41:46
She starts going out in the academic city and starts giving out the or within
41:50
the firm. She probably takes care of the ovens. I probably cut the vegetables or
41:56
cut the ingredients for the cake and probably she only starts packing them
42:00
up. So what we have done is further divided into departments right okay then
42:05
I hired Leo you want to look at the data as to what
42:09
happened 80 so output goes up but now what's the
42:15
difference 20
42:17
20 why Maya walked in 80
42:22
Maya walked in only 20 extra walked in 30 extra Leo walked in we is
42:30
still producing more output but the difference is only 20.
42:41
The capital was always the same. So more and more.
42:50
Okay. Okay. So what? There's no space.
42:56
Too many orders. Too many orders. Too many cooks spoil
43:00
the broth. Probably overcrowding of space. VMA, it's a small space only.
43:06
It's a small kitchen. You probably don't have space in the company. What should
43:11
the company do? Do you see how the warning bells have
43:15
begun? Just from your fourth data point, just from your fourth plot,
43:22
do you see how I'm jumping from 10, 30, 60, it is still increasing but at a
43:28
lower rate. Are you able to see that? Yeah. This is the point where the
43:33
warning bells have begun that perhaps there is overcrowding in the company.
43:40
Perhaps efficiency issues. How do you calculate efficiency?
43:45
was how many in mathematics that's known as average.
43:53
If you start calculating the average in the data also your data is what
44:04
looks like this. So because you said the word efficiency I'm teaching you this 10
44:09
by 1 how much is it? 30 by 2
44:14
80 by 60 by 3 80 by 4
44:19
95 by five 19 So do you see how it's rising up and
44:25
then falling this is what Nick is trying to say efficiency is first going up and
44:30
when Leo joins probably there's a fall in efficiency are you able to understand
44:36
and why is there a fall in efficiency perhaps overcrowding of resources no
44:41
pace. Perhaps, Gara, the capital that you were working with was constant, K
44:47
equals 10. Perhaps now you need to start putting in more money into that capital.
44:53
Maybe he walks in and says, "How the hell do you want me to produce more
44:56
cakes when Maya has taken oven number one, AI has taken oven number two, Gara
45:02
has taken cash register, what do I work with with me?" So this is also the time
45:08
when they go out and start raising money or looking out putting in more
45:13
investment into capital. So what am I solving for? Is the space
45:18
issues in the company putting in more money as investments? What else? What
45:23
else can you say? Is that the only reason is Leo the only reason why
45:27
efficiency is falling down? What else? What other problems can you
45:31
find out? So conflicts have begun.
45:39
Conflicts have begun and this gives birth to your subject called
45:42
organization behavior. How do you manage people when there is a small space in
45:47
the company? How do you solve for that are all HR 101 reasons? What else must
45:52
be going wrong in the company? At some point wages have to fall.
45:57
At some point wages have to fall already. There there's a problem in the
46:00
laborers. They're not wanting to work. Maybe they'll exit if you end up
46:03
reducing the wages. But maybe you are not incentivizing them enough.
46:08
Maybe what you are granting them conflicts can be taken away.
46:12
Did the same thing in payments. Maybe when it was only month, she was getting
46:16
100% profit. Now that she had to divide and you know
46:21
conquer she had to pay more people and then she's maybe she's not making enough
46:26
money. So instead of paying you know the second employee, she was getting
46:30
fine. So the distribution structure the the compensation structure that person
46:34
calls me inefficient you will call me cheap words any other word you guys may
46:38
want to attach but outside of my uh uh let's not describe me anymore even
46:43
though it may be true uh can you also understand that perhaps the HR has done
46:49
a very poor job in mapping the resources they were the ones hiring right they put
46:56
me in the kitchen right this is where your skill matching Being exercised by
47:01
HR becomes very important for your efficiency, higher efficiency. He did
47:06
not belong in the kitchen too just like Ghaima for example. So HR matches, skill
47:11
distribution matching, demand supply matching becomes important. Number two,
47:16
do you also realize that the people that I may have hired in my baking business
47:20
probably need training sessions? Do you see how efficiency was falling
47:27
down? Everybody put it on Leo. Yeah. Nobody said that perhaps the
47:34
people who were working in the business also needed to be trained more. Are you
47:38
with me? Perhaps that could have pulled up my efficiency. And lastly, the ovens
47:44
that you are working with perhaps need to be repaired or perhaps GMA only knows
47:50
how to work with seven features in those ovens out of 10 features.
47:56
What I just did in the class is it spoke about hiring, firing, skill distribution
48:01
matching, division of labor, specialization of labor, investing
48:05
money, raising money, repairing capital and repairing my capital, repairing or
48:10
buying more capital, so much more. Are you with me? Just by
48:16
three and four data observations you can get.
48:20
These are just warning signals that you can get in the real life. You will have
48:25
to collect this data from annual reports. Annual reports will cleanly
48:29
give you labor data. Will also give you revenue data. Are you with me? There's
48:35
one more exercise that I want you to do is calculate something called
49:22
Okay. Calculate something called
49:35
Okay, just look over here. How the very first person was Gara, right?
49:41
How many extra cakes could she produce? Extra
49:47
only 10. How do I get 10 minus 0? The next person was hired was Maya.
49:53
How many extra cakes could she produce? And the next person was AI. How many
50:00
extra cakes? Next person was
50:04
how many extra? Can I go on?
50:08
Yeah. What is this called? This is called marginal
50:17
product extra product. Every time I say
50:24
marginal, you say extra extra. So if I hire one more labor, how
50:34
much extra output can I produce? Can I expect 20? So I see that earlier if I
50:41
were to take all these data points, let's say I fill it and for the purpose
50:46
of this class, I've already made the graph. The entire graph now looks like
50:53
this. Uh it's just empty. It's just empty. So
50:58
do you see earlier if you look at the data GMA was producing 10 cakes then I
51:04
hired Maya 20 more cakes then I hired AI 30
51:11
more cakes then I hired Leo 20 more cakes. So I plotted the entire marginal
51:18
product like this. Can you see that? If I were to show this graph to you, how
51:23
many people were do you think were apt for the business?
51:28
Three. And now if I show you both the graphs together, what do you think? How
51:35
many people should be hired? I still I didn't need to give you so
51:46
much information. You can clearly see just from cake data and labor data.
51:53
Amazing. Answer is still dependent on the fact that GAMA as a business wants
52:00
to produce maximum cakes. Maximum cakes would also mean maximum revenue.
52:06
Answer is still seven. But now you know clearly from the company data that once
52:13
Gimma ends up hiring more than three people she can expect fall in
52:18
efficiency. Are you able to see that? So we all kept on blaming Leo.
52:25
Caution to the managers. This is what HR does very wrongly in their department.
52:30
They start attributing the success of the company to the person who was hired
52:35
next not realizing that it is Leo, me, Agni and Maya working together and
52:42
therefore to the best of our potentiality we have been able to
52:44
produce cakes. Not that that Leo was magical or not was Paula was saying was
52:50
inefficient. I was efficient because of which we were able to work together and
52:54
produce better. But over here from data I could clearly show you when is it that
52:59
you can expect efficiency to fall. Are you with me?
53:03
What is this called? I know this is marginal analysis.
53:08
Marginal product extra product. In economics this is
53:14
known as diminishing marginal returns. Diminishing marginal. Diminishing means
53:23
falling down. So diminishing marginal returns meaning the extra returns that
53:29
the company is producing is falling down. Diminishing marginal returns that
53:35
is diminishing means falling marginal means extra returns means output falling
53:42
extra output diminishing marginal returns. Now if you
53:47
have the data here from where is my diminishing returns kicking in?
53:56
Can you see that the fall is from here? So from here diminishing returns are
54:02
setting in the business. Imagine company just started. Company just began and
54:08
right from the third labor companies already entering diminishing returns.
54:13
What do you think? Why do you think is the reason?
54:17
Why do you think they're they're running into diminishing returns so fast?
54:23
So probably GAMA started with a very small company right from the beginning.
54:28
That's the investment she made because of which
54:32
and quickly wanting to maximize and quickly wanting to maximize perhaps
54:36
the number of labors overcrowding was an issue company was too small space was
54:40
too small capital money money put into capital was too less perhaps why the
54:45
fall began right away are you with me what I have done in the class is revised
54:51
your previous sessions introduced a new concept I will take this new concept
54:57
give you a lot of caseled to help you into decision- making in businesses and
55:02
also introduce Harvard business case studies. So now you take 5 minutes
55:07
break. You come back at 1 folks. I don't have much time. Maybe 112. Come back at
55:15
112. I want to solve some case in the class. Apply this in the real world and
55:20
then send you back. Take 5 minutes break. Come back.
55:34
Yeah. Why if Uber prices go down?
55:45
Like because price of the Uber goes down.
55:49
So you start wanting more Uber. So that is why you stop going to the
55:55
buses. went up for buses.
56:03
Yeah. Go up. Yeah. Do you love
1:00:27
Are you listening to her? Okay, come back.
1:00:44
Let's start. Let's start. Let's start. Let's start.
1:00:51
Go back. Sit down. Okay. Do all this camaraderie later. Go.
1:00:59
Sit down. Can I please have some silence in the
1:01:05
class? She's right here. You go back.
1:01:16
Okay. Okay, people. Let's start. Okay. Can somebody help me explain how to
1:01:21
pronounce this? I mean to the tooth
1:01:29
tooth tooth. You feel a bite to the tooth.
1:01:33
Oh. Oh, al dente.
1:01:38
Alente. Okay. Thank you very much.
1:01:44
Look at the Nick. Get back on trust. Fernando. Ignore him. He's people. You
1:01:49
people like him. They act like their own study and then they do very well in
1:01:53
examinations. Fernando, he's cheating. Okay, come back. There is a small case
1:02:00
that I've written in the class. Sam, focus. J, focus.
1:02:07
This is your case. You can't see.
1:02:20
Can someone read it out? How do we solve for this guys? I really
1:02:25
don't know how to solve for it. Can we?
1:02:32
It'll take some time for me to send it over. But can you take your phones out?
1:02:37
Zoom. Can you take your phones out and zoom if
1:02:40
you can't read it? Imagine
1:02:54
Andrea is from Italy and she owns a central kitchen.
1:03:00
She wants to create a small B2B business or rather a B2B business where she is
1:03:07
saying early in the morning in Italy I will cut and chop all the vegetables,
1:03:12
pack them up together and sell it to all the QSRs around me. What are QSRs? Quick
1:03:20
service restaurants. Can there be silence please?
1:03:27
Right. So, how should Andrea go about the decision of hiring more workers? She
1:03:32
knows she's going to be paying them 50 bucks an hour.
1:03:36
What sort of data do I need to solve for it? What is the price of the product?
1:03:41
10. Right. Right. Right. Right. How do I figure out how many people to hire? What
1:03:47
data should I ask her? Output. Which means GAMA the shortrun
1:03:54
data that you gave us in the past something like that where I know well if
1:03:59
I hire Jotendra how many can he produce if I hire Tanisha how many can she
1:04:05
produce if I hire I forgot your name Natalia how many can she produce only
1:04:12
then when I have this expectation setting I can know how many to hire are
1:04:16
you with me so which means I need to collect the expectations from her in my
1:04:22
consultancy call and say that you know what Andrea can you help me. Andrea says
1:04:28
yeah when I hire the first worker she should be able to produce 10 boxes of
1:04:35
vegetables. When I hire the second one about 18 third one about 24. And I
1:04:41
expect similar boxes of food to be prepared by them in the morning. Can you
1:04:46
say something about the business even before I ask you to do what can you say?
1:04:52
Just look at the data. What do you say? What do you see?
1:04:57
What can you say about the data? That as I'm hiring more
1:05:06
output is reducing. What is that called in economics?
1:05:11
Diminishing. Which means the company is starting off with diminishing. Stop
1:05:16
crying. What happened? Okay. Okay. Which means as the company starts working from
1:05:22
the beginning, there is already diminishing returns to scale. Can you
1:05:26
say something about the business apart from this about the size of the
1:05:29
business? It's a small business. There is no other
1:05:33
reason why overcrowding should happen from the beginning itself. Just by
1:05:37
looking at data even without speaking to Andrea we are able to say so much about
1:05:41
how much the business must must must be in terms of size how many people can she
1:05:45
hire so on and so forth. Are you with me?
1:05:48
So apart from just recommending to her how many people she can hire you can
1:05:53
also recommend efficiency increasing strategies because she clearly needs it
1:05:59
with me. Okay. Okay. Okay. So now we have the
1:06:03
data given over here and Andrea has clearly told me that GAMA
1:06:09
I want to maximize profits in the business. Uh don't uh remove Mark's
1:06:14
attendance. Mark has taken my permission before going out. Yeah. Uh Gimma clearly
1:06:20
I need to maximize my profits. All this while I've been working towards revenue
1:06:24
maximization strategies. Are you with me?
1:06:27
Now this woman wants to maximize her profit. Can you clearly help me in the
1:06:33
class to understand if she wants to maximize her profit then
1:06:38
perhaps I need her revenue and her cost that's only how I can produce profit
1:06:44
right profit right okay okay how much is the revenue folks
1:06:56
exactly why do I say 100 formula of revenue
1:07:01
price into quantity and how much was the price of the product?
1:07:06
$10. So it should be 10 into Q. Now tell me what's the revenue?
1:07:13
Zero. 10 into 10. Price is 10. Quantity is 10.
1:07:19
100. Next. Next.
1:07:24
Next. Next.
1:07:26
Thank you very much. If I were to say this is revenue, can you help me
1:07:32
construct something called marginal revenue?
1:07:40
And what do I mean by marginal revenue? Every time I say marginal, you say
1:07:46
extra. So which means I need to calculate extra revenue.
1:07:50
Right? What's the extra revenue here? Are you sure?
1:07:56
There's nothing I don't have past data. Are you with me?
1:08:01
What's the extra revenue here? 100 minus 0
1:08:08
which is 100 80 60 40 20 Beautiful. Thank you very much.
1:08:18
Now I want silence in the class. Okay. Jay, are you with me? Javier,
1:08:24
from where do you need me? Are you with me?
1:08:28
From where? The last part. Marginal revenue. Is
1:08:32
revenue clear to you? Huh?
1:08:41
Okay. I had said that the price of the
1:08:46
products Now you shut up. Thank you. Price of the product is 10. I had said
1:08:51
that in the beginning Maria it was described. Okay. What is revenue?
1:08:58
Revenue is price into quantity with me. What is price here?
1:09:05
What is quantity? Quantity is
1:09:09
where is one written? This is output or quantity. What's the
1:09:13
output in here? So 10 into 0 is
1:09:19
right. Okay. Okay. Next price is 10. How much is quantity?
1:09:27
Okay. Total output meaning total quantity.
1:09:34
Yes. How the hell do I know that the total
1:09:42
output of five people would be? How do you know?
1:09:49
Okay. Number one is number one. Number one, there are two
1:09:53
ways to go about it. You are talking to me about data collection right now.
1:09:56
There are two ways to go about it. Number one, I ask manager for his her or
1:10:01
their expectations. If Leo has been hired, I want Leo to produce 100 bucks
1:10:06
worth of output, which would just mean that I want Leo to produce 10 products.
1:10:11
This is something a manager needs to tell me when I'm hiring. Even when I'm
1:10:15
hiring for a consultancy firm, I have expectations. The manager will give you
1:10:19
expectations that if I'm hiring Leo, he needs to be able to complete three
1:10:23
projects by the end of the year. Just like how Andrea has to say how many
1:10:28
number of food boxes Gara should be able to produce. Andrea also knows that when
1:10:34
I hire the second person, she won't be able to produce 20 because there is no
1:10:39
space. So that is why it should have been 10, 20, 30. But clearly she is also
1:10:45
realizing that the space that she has is very small. Perhaps it's a minivan where
1:10:50
they're producing and cutting all the vegetables. So that is why she needs to
1:10:54
align with these expectations. Number one. Number two is something called
1:10:58
benchmarking exercise. What do I mean by benchmarking exercise? I find
1:11:03
competitors around me. Track their sales report, track their annual reports,
1:11:08
track their or talk to these people. Not only when I just talk when I first
1:11:12
principles or when I just talk to customers, I also talk to suppliers.
1:11:16
Collecting such information is very difficult. Comes with experience, comes
1:11:20
with practice, comes with expectations mapping. That's how the data came with
1:11:25
me. Okay. Coming back to more basics
1:11:29
question here. Maria, look at me. What's the price here? Price is constant,
1:11:34
right? Given in the data, what's the output?
1:11:39
10. What's the revenue? 100, right? 10 into 10.
1:11:45
Okay. What is the price here?
1:11:50
Yeah. Price is constant.
1:11:58
Price is constant. Is given. Price is constant. It's given 10.
1:12:03
And how many is she producing next? How many is being produced?
1:12:08
18. So can I say 10 into 18 is 180? Yeah, that's how I made the revenue.
1:12:15
Okay. 180 240 280
1:12:22
300. Are you with me? Yes.
1:12:24
Then I said marginal revenue. What do I mean by marginal revenue?
1:12:32
Extra revenue. And I just said, "Oh, look over here. When Gara started
1:12:37
working, she was producing 100. Earlier there was no no production. So perhaps
1:12:42
she added 100 extra boxes of food in the organization. Oh
1:12:48
uh uh Natalia came. Natalia is producing 180 and earlier it was 100. How many
1:12:55
extra? You're not I'm repeating everything for
1:12:59
you and you're not focusing. Focus
1:13:04
you. Yes you. How many is being produced
1:13:09
next? Okay, I'll work with you in the office
1:13:15
hours. If you need help, I can work with you more slowly. For the purpose of the
1:13:19
class, let's go faster. Next 60 then and
1:13:24
20. Can you help me with the costs? Can you help me with the cost? Total
1:13:29
cost. Zero.
1:13:32
Zero. Then how many do I hire? One.
1:13:35
One. So what's the cost? 50. How many do I hire? How
1:13:40
total cost? Next.
1:13:44
Thank you. Thank you.
1:13:48
Can I also calculate something called the marginal cost?
1:13:55
Every time I say marginal, you say. So what's the marginal cost here?
1:14:01
That's zero. Next 50. That's actually not zero. I just
1:14:06
don't know the previous data. I don't know the previous data. I'll give you
1:14:10
another search pricing data. You'll clearly understand why. What's the
1:14:13
marginal cost here? And here it's constant because what she
1:14:21
was paying to the people was also constant.
1:14:24
Okay. Okay. Finally, can I calculate something called profit?
1:14:31
Okay. Profit is nothing but total revenue minus total cost.
1:14:36
What is total revenue here? 100.
1:14:41
And what is total cost? So what's the profit?
1:14:46
Okay. Next 180 minus
1:14:50
100 which is 80. 240 minus
1:14:55
150 which is 90. Next.
1:14:59
Next and 50.
1:15:04
How many How many do you think Maria is going to hire?
1:15:11
Can you Where is the profit maximized guys?
1:15:17
It's 50 maximum, 80 maximum, 90 maximum. Can you see clearly against 90 there are
1:15:24
three workers? So perhaps Andrea would be hiring three
1:15:29
workers. Are you able to see that Sam? Question.
1:15:34
No question. Ai question. I will come back to you. Any question
1:15:40
Jagat? Why did we not previous?
1:15:43
What previous one? Like the labors?
1:15:45
Yeah. What labors? Like this exercise
1:15:49
of each labor. Okay. What is what are people in the
1:15:52
class telling me? GMA, why are you not doing the marginal exercise? We can also
1:15:58
do that. What do I mean by marginal profit or
1:16:03
marginal exercise? Look over here. Is is the extra revenue more than extra cost?
1:16:13
Is marginal revenue more than marginal cost?
1:16:17
So which means is extra revenue more than extra cost? Am I getting more
1:16:22
money? Am I spending less?
1:16:26
I'm spending only 50 bucks, right? But how much money am I making?
1:16:32
Yes, I'm making 100. So I'm making 100 bucks and I'm letting go.
1:16:37
Is it good for my business? Do I hire that labor? So ladies and
1:16:42
gentlemen, if marginal revenue is more than marginal cost, I hire with me. Next
1:16:50
second worker, how much money is she getting?
1:16:54
Extra money. How much money is she spending?
1:17:00
Is 80 more than 50? Is MR more than MC?
1:17:06
Do I hire? Okay. How much extra money is she
1:17:10
making? And how much extra money is that going?
1:17:15
Is MR more than MC? Do I hire?
1:17:21
Folks, how how far can I go in terms of hiring? Now tell me over here
1:17:30
when it's 59 and 50 will you hire when it's 55 and 50 will you hire
1:17:41
when is M3 more than M3 will you hire will you when it's 52 and it's 50 will
1:17:48
you hire when it's 51.5
1:17:52
and when it's 50 will you hire when it's 50.5 and 50 will you hire?
1:17:58
No. Who said no?
1:18:03
Think in terms of millions now because you're thinking in terms of dollars
1:18:07
that's why it's not affecting you. But 50.5 millions and 50 million. Hell yes,
1:18:13
you will. Are you with me? Units matter here. And I'm coming
1:18:20
you will hire because extra money which means I will go all the way to 50 equals
1:18:28
50 where I truly become indifference and this is nothing but MR equals MC
1:18:37
which means any profit maximization point has to be determined by MR equals
1:18:44
MC and profit will be maximum. Clearly you can see profit is maximum. If I had
1:18:51
given you even cleaner data, you would have reached higher profits over here.
1:18:55
Are you understanding from? Yeah. Because you're not
1:19:00
concentrating. And I've opened office hours from 7 to 8:00 p.m. If it's in if
1:19:04
you're interested, I'll be happy to teach it. I've been like a baby. I've
1:19:08
been telling price is 10, quantity is 10. You're not able to say 10 into 10 is
1:19:12
100, which is okay. You meet me in the evening from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. I'll
1:19:16
break it down further and teach you. Is that okay?
1:19:22
I don't know what to say. Can we meet for office hours at 7 p.m.?
1:19:32
From where do you want to know? Tell me. From where do you want to understand?
1:19:42
Tell me from there. Okay. Marginal revenue is 80.
1:19:51
Yes. About 80. Let's I'll take I'll teach you after
1:19:54
class for folks. Are you able to see MR is more than MC?
1:19:59
And therefore you will produce. So you go all the way till MR equals MC.
1:20:04
Yeah. Yes. You will higher when MC you will hire till the point MR equals
1:20:10
MC 5050 higher right
1:20:13
yes because that gives you higher profit highest profit I want you to take two
1:20:17
minutes in the class and look at this data
1:20:28
I want you to look at search pricing data
1:20:37
I have a question. Yeah.
1:20:38
So all the data that you're getting based on assumptions which are
1:20:42
where I have done market research, spoken to companies, done benchmarking
1:20:46
exercise, spoken to competitors, downloaded annual reports, then finally
1:20:49
I've given you a screenshot of data. Massive exercise. This is just 10 data
1:20:54
points. Real world takes six to eight months.
1:20:56
But it still is not constant. It's it keeps changing. Okay, this could also
1:21:01
have been previous past data also could have been last year of her
1:21:05
working and now she's doing fresh hiring decisions and she uses that. My question
1:21:09
was as business people how do you choose which data to like use when it comes to
1:21:15
if you don't have experience then you can't rely on past data which means you
1:21:19
need to conduct market research to collect this information oneonone
1:21:23
okay look at this data folks I've given you price per ride I've given
1:21:30
you number of rides I've also given you cost you quickly calculate profits right
1:21:35
now quickly calculate profits.
1:21:45
You should have been giving me the maximum point by a calculus in the
1:21:47
previous question, right? By coding from the previous question, you could have
1:21:51
given me a point of maximum point just by doing differentation in Python.
1:22:24
Is the company maximizing profit at 50 rights?
1:22:30
Not maximum. Not maximum. It's more than 51.
1:22:35
It's more than 51. Okay. What is revenue?
1:22:46
So price into quantity. Yeah.
1:22:50
This is one way to repeat the it's same question but different context. Uh
1:22:54
Steven. Steven. No. What's your name?
1:22:57
Steven. If you didn't understand the previous one, this is a fresh
1:22:59
opportunity starting from scratch. Coming back, how much is revenue?
1:23:05
O, come back. Price into quantity, 25,000.
1:23:13
Now, what is the price? What's the ride?
1:23:16
So, how much is the revenue? 2490.
1:23:22
Next into 52. What's the answer?
1:23:29
Now easy
1:23:35
revenue maximize revenue have written understood
1:23:38
what's the cost this can I write down profit
1:23:44
what is profit this minus this 7,000 next
1:23:51
6,000 630
1:23:53
630 next 62
1:23:57
6,000 220 Next
1:24:06
my question back to all of you is Uber maximizing its profit at 50 rides
1:24:13
everybody incorrect don't know yet
1:24:21
you can't just give me random answers when I ask you the first question then
1:24:24
you should have been confidently thing and now suddenly everybody is oh now we
1:24:29
are smarter I'm not sorry
1:24:32
you're not smart question is given Leo is the company maximizing its profit at
1:24:38
50 rides we are not sure
1:24:45
that's not what you said so now everyone calm down listen to me one thing I
1:24:52
taught you just 20 seconds before kindly when Andrea was maximizing profit why
1:24:59
the hell did I do marginal analysis you had total revenue you had total cost
1:25:05
whichever was corresponding to maximum profits you could have told her to hire
1:25:09
that but I taught you to go all the way to MR equals MC can we quickly calculate
1:25:18
marginal revenue here what do I mean by marginal revenue extra
1:25:23
revenue venue correct how much is the extra revenue here
1:25:32
nothing I don't know because GAMA previous data is not there are you with
1:25:36
me what's the next revenue extra revenue - 10 I'm perhaps bleeding money 24,990US
1:25:51
25,000 which is - 10 with me. Next minus
1:25:59
40. Next 999us
1:26:13
24,960 - 24,990 is minus
1:26:18
30 next is minus 50 can I also calculate marginal cost or
1:26:25
extra cost do I have past data
1:26:29
chhatty with me yeah can't create do I what is the cost now difference in cost
1:26:36
360 360
1:26:39
280 Next.
1:26:43
140us 740 guys. 600 right
1:26:58
guys. How much is 19,140us 18,740?
1:27:11
Can you subtract? No. 19,40US
1:27:17
18,740. Yes.
1:27:29
Yes. 18,360US
1:27:36
18,000 is 380. 18,360 - 18,000 happens to be 360.
1:27:48
Divit next number. Is this done?
1:28:03
Where is the minus? Why will there be minus? Leo 18,360
1:28:08
minus 18,000. Now at profit maximization, you taught
1:28:13
me that profit is maximum at 7,000, isn't it? Then at that point, MR should
1:28:20
have been equal to MC. MR should have been equal to MC,
1:28:25
isn't it? We just is MR equals MC unless you tell me dash equals dash.
1:28:32
No, shut up. Which means MR is not equals to MC. We can't say that. Can I
1:28:39
predict MR and MC? Yes, I can because I clearly have data given over here. Do
1:28:45
you see how data is falling back 20 steps?
1:28:49
50 to 30, 30 to 10. What would be this number? Plus 10.
1:28:55
400 to 380, 380 to 360. What would is 340 equal to 10?
1:29:04
Which means perhaps the company is not profit maximizing. All of you in unison
1:29:10
had told me company is maximizing its profit at profit at 50 rides. Now do you
1:29:15
know why I taught you MR equals MC? And for people who may have done in
1:29:20
school, now do you know why you studied MR equals MC? Are you with me?
1:29:25
Why no? So it's not equal to MC.
1:29:31
So therefore you go all the way back where?
1:29:34
Yeah. Yeah. So you want to increase the price. Thank you very much. And that is
1:29:38
why it is called search pricing data. Thank you very much.
1:29:46
Mindblowing. Mind-blowing. Thank you very much. Do
1:29:48
you see that? From a simple profit maximization, we went all the way till
1:29:53
MR equals MC. Leo was like, "Oh, you got to go back. So, you got to increase the
1:29:58
price." Oh, this is nothing but search pricing.
1:30:05
Ah, you're right. The change that I'm doing is the same number. That could be
1:30:08
a constraint in the problem. Are you demand?
1:30:12
How is it defining the law of demand? price will rise to fall.
1:30:16
It is going to fall 49 rides, 48 rides, 47 rides and the price goes up 520, 510.
1:30:26
Is that not like a loss for the company? Thank you very much. Next question,
1:30:31
ladies and gentlemen. Is that not a loss for the company? Look over here. Come
1:30:36
back. Come back. What's happening to my marginal revenue? What is marginal
1:30:41
revenue? Extra revenue. extra revenue
1:30:45
when I'm cutting price is my revenue increasing
1:30:50
ta ladies and gentlemen for all the hard
1:30:55
work that I've done in the class this puts it together
1:31:00
you tell me where is Uber positioned inelastic or elastic
1:31:05
elastic when I'm increasing prices what's
1:31:08
happening to my revenue going up where must I be positioned
1:31:14
inelastic clearly when I'm increasing my prices
1:31:19
extra revenue is increasing so I am not losing money I am
1:31:24
making money guys so I know you guys are not
1:31:35
academicians but I worked really hard to put this question together to put
1:31:40
together law of demand put together profit maximization put together
1:31:43
elasticity, put together business making. So this is the best question
1:31:47
that I have made in my career. Now of course for you it may be nothing for me
1:31:51
it makes a lot of sense. This question puts together ties together all my five
1:31:56
sessions so far with me.
1:31:59
Ah thank god okay next class revise all this come back it will be an entire
1:32:05
class of Harvard Business Review case workshop. We'll take both case studies.
1:32:11
We'll solve it end to end. Thank you very much.
1:32:18
Just just so you guys know, please please make sure you give feedback. This
1:32:21
is a nice class. Make sure you put it on feedback. If you don't give feedback,
1:32:26
your your attendance will not be marked, right? Just make sure you give feedback.
1:32:52
recording stopped.

Should my business engage in price wars?
25/09/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
Dr. Garima Chaklader
0:06
Nobody judges me for the music. Let it be a yoga session where you study
0:39
mathematics. Do you want the light?
0:44
No. This is the max I can do to um introduce
0:54
math to you. Can you imagine Israel? The creativity
3:39
Done. No. Can I have some water?
3:46
bottle today. Heat. Heat.
5:36
Good job. Done.
6:18
How many of you done reading? Raise your hands.
6:25
It's the same as you show, right? Same as
6:29
you show like killed when some people killed you.
6:36
You will find out. Yes. Not like that. Very true. Very true.
6:40
Like the ghost. Correct. Very true. Just
6:45
we'll talk about the Nash equilibrium here. Now, somebody can raise their
6:49
hands and tell me what's going on in the case study. Oh, freedom. Somebody tell
6:53
me. So, basically it was a competition in
6:59
pricing between Sony and so they initially launched both their
7:05
products at a very high price. But then as like the years went on, they kept
7:11
slashing the prices to gain more market share.
7:14
And uh is it good for the business?
7:17
I mean depends on how much profit margin they have.
7:22
So they wouldn't want to cut it so much that they start taking losses of making
7:28
any profit. But I mean as long as they cut it enough
7:32
to beat the other competitors, I think it's a good idea. So which means we need
7:36
to analyze the money. I think it's not a good idea because as
7:40
much as they cut prices like they will lose their profit because profit squeeze
7:45
and they should agree because that's why it exists like you know keep your
7:49
competitor close because if they would agree on cutting prices in the same time
7:54
they would win because they cut prices endlessly and it's not giving.
7:58
What if I told you that they did talk to each other while cutting the price?
8:01
Matias they did talk to each other. They did and sometimes they did sometimes
8:07
they didn't agree but the the days they did would do would you think that will
8:10
help them? Let's analyze if there is any truth to
8:17
what we are saying which means in the next 15 minutes you will spend some time
8:21
in constructing a payoff matrix. We have spoken about payoff matrix right? What's
8:28
a payoff matrix? Prison sorry.
8:34
It was a prison. Whosoever is working on the laptop, you're free to but I also
8:38
want you to work on the payoff. So finally you will make the payoff makers
8:42
also. Okay. Okay. This is an online clause
8:47
which means in this case study. In this case study we're talking about
8:57
the year 2009 which was also the recession year. We're talking about the
9:08
price competition between two companies Sony and Microsoft.
9:12
Given the information, forget the information.
9:17
Can I how do I go about making the payoff
9:21
matrix? We have to identify the players. Can it
9:30
be a 2 +2 matrix? Actually,
9:43
it will make sense if I do it on the board today because I will need to keep
9:46
on referring. Who's player number one?
10:02
Anybody can be right. could be Sony and I Sony makes PS or Xbox
10:10
and I have which is Xbox
10:17
360. Xbox 360. Okay. And what are the price
10:20
points that they can work with? Okay. So earlier they were operating
10:26
with $399. Yes.
10:28
Now they may or may not operate at $399. Similarly, Microsoft selling at 3.99.
10:36
They can also choose to sell at 299. Right? That's my payoff matrix. Now,
10:42
what numbers do I fill in there? This is prices 299 for 79.
10:49
What is it? The prices of Xbox 360.
10:54
This is price. Yes.
10:56
What numbers do I fill in the box? Siri, what do you feel in the box?
11:14
Why? You said you know everything.
11:18
Is that right? You told me that day. I don't know everything.
11:21
So, my name Why are you on your phone? Switch your phone off.
11:24
Perhaps uh the sales that you sales rejected sales. Can you help me with the
11:30
numbers? Okay, help me with the numbers. What about start from here? When Sony
11:39
sells at 3.99, so what these So what these folks
11:44
Okay, monkeys, what you folks are doing are checking out this table, right? that
11:50
when Sony sells at 3.99, Microsoft sells at 399, you've gone to this table and
11:57
said, "Hey, this is Sony. This is Microsoft."
12:03
And I see, hey, when Sony sells at 3.99, these two when Microsoft sells at 399.
12:10
Okay, this one. So, Sony sells 399. Microsoft sells 3.99 probably 8.75
12:19
million units and 8, right? Microsoft size 8, correct?
12:28
What's the next number? 11.5
12:32
11.5 Sony 399
12:38
Xbox 299 Sony 399 Xbox 299 8.25
12:48
8.25 25 then 12.5
12:52
next and 7 next
12:59
11 11
13:03
next very good
13:11
numbers make sense also right for example
13:15
let's assume when Sony sells at 3.99 9 and Microsoft decides to cut the price.
13:22
See how the market share has gone to Microsoft. Yeah. So numbers make sense.
13:27
And when both of them cut the price, more people are incentivized to buy the
13:32
consoles and they end up buying going there. What's the problem with the
13:36
matrix? What is the problem with the matrix?
13:42
Guys, you understand me, right? Yeah. Okay, tell me.
13:50
Yeah, I don't know if people follow my accent or not all. I'm just asking.
13:53
Quick check. I know the price and all, but what do
13:59
you think? The numbers are correct. Box is correct. Where can I go wrong with
14:04
the analysis right now? If if we were analyzing this box, what would you
14:09
predict me to do? So like the ones where they both have
14:12
select them all because sorry Lucia. Yeah. Does like the ones where they both
14:18
have the similar clothes share but then I guess that would raise a lot of
14:22
competition between the both. So what should I do?
14:25
I don't know. Is it a is it a political is it an aggressive selfish
14:31
government strategy or not? So what should I do?
14:33
Lower the price. It's a this right?
14:37
Yeah. I end up lowering the price and also makes sure that I'm able to sell
14:40
more. What's the problem as as a Yes. Matias?
14:44
We able to see the benefits that you're selling more most. Isn't that a
14:49
good enough benefit? Huh?
14:53
Domestic equal equal between
15:00
you you still earn more when you sell less.
15:04
You what? You earn more when you sell less.
15:06
You earn more when you sell less. There are two things that are going on.
15:12
Number one, you're making me sell higher quantity over here for sure because all
15:17
of you are saying, "Hey, 11 is more than 8."
15:20
Number one, maybe the amount of money you make from here is perhaps more. That
15:28
is why Javiar is saying that maybe the revenue you get over here is way more
15:33
than the revenue you get over here. Number one. Number two, what Jotimra
15:38
said, hey costs, let's say all of you advised me to sell
15:45
maximum amount of money, maximum amount of sales,
15:49
maximum amount of consoles. What if I'm bleeding money?
15:54
Did you ever ask me what the costs are? What what if the profits become
15:58
negative? Are you with me? So how we perhaps need
16:03
to look at revenue why we perhaps need to look at profit and just looking at
16:08
units sold maybe incomplete information are you with me
16:13
so now tell me should I look at so that now you know that I can't just look at
16:18
units sold it sells me half the information and if that is true what
16:22
should I choose revenue or profit why revenue
16:30
Come give your attendance please tell me
16:34
you don't have you have
16:37
you don't have I have income I have disposable income
16:42
but I have revenue it's incomplete information because it doesn't take cost
16:46
of product so we can't tell if it's a good decision or a bad one
16:58
my question is should I look at revenue Maybe should I look at profits?
17:01
Profits. Why not revenue?
17:04
Because we could be making a lot of revenue by having losses.
17:07
We could be making a lot of revenue having losses. I have always taught you
17:11
whenever we talk about revenue maximization. We talk about startups.
17:16
Those startups need money. Investors are aware of that. Even as a founder when
17:21
you're established, you may choose revenue maximization. But generally for
17:25
these established companies like Sony and Microsoft over the years they would
17:29
want to make profits profit maximization is more important to them than revenue
17:34
maximization. Hence I will fill this matrix up with profit numbers. Are you
17:39
with me? And how these numbers may be giving us an incorrect incomplete
17:45
picture. So I get rid of these
17:50
which means I need to be able to compute profit for these businesses.
17:59
But why do they choose profit over talking about consoles over here?
18:08
Yeah. But what they just said that they make more money by selling games and not
18:14
consoles. That doesn't mean that I start doing
18:16
sell consoles. That also doesn't mean that I never
18:21
think about recovering the value of consoles.
18:25
You know, someone make hoping for more revenue, hence
18:29
market share. Oh god, it's expensive to make it. In fact, you'll see shortly how
18:33
expensive it is to make it. Let's go back and also remember they're
18:38
selling Nick, they're selling 8.75 million units.
18:43
It's all the thousands or 10,000s or hundreds of thousands. It's a millions.
18:46
So they will want to get that money back.
18:49
What I want to do is right now think about calculating
18:54
profits. Which means I will break this box down into box one, box two,
19:02
box three and four. Let's analyze one. What is the price at which Sony is
19:09
selling? What is the price at which Microsoft is
19:19
selling? Looking at the table, can you tell me
19:26
what is the quantity Sony is selling? What's the quantity?
19:46
Polo want to guess it's 8.75. Okay, it's 8.75.
19:55
Can I now calculate? We know how we know 8.75 399 399 8.75 to
20:04
clearion. Million correct million. Can we now
20:09
calculate revenue for the business? What is revenue?
20:16
Price of Sony multiplied by quantity of Sony. Price of Sony 399.
20:24
Quantity of Sony 8.75.
20:29
What's the answer? Take out your calculators. Uh
20:35
3491 million 3491
20:41
no just 25 because in million25
20:46
yeah million dollars okay
20:55
can we now calculate costs cost of Sony
21:04
Where do I do costs? Okay, let's do costs here. Costs cost only. I can move
21:11
quickly to exhibit number two and three. Which one do I look at? Two.
21:19
Which box? The top one or the bottom one?
21:22
Because that clearly says Sony. Yeah. And Sony is creating 8.75 million
21:29
units. So, what column to look at? second column because this says 8.75
21:36
million units. What is the cost per unit?
21:40
343. This is the time when I want you to
21:44
properly read the question. If they reduce it by 100, then it would
22:06
be 29. So we can do the um the cost of price times the
22:13
Okay, you're right. I understand. What else?
22:25
So the question is about them wanting to would they have the will of doing? Would
22:31
they wish to? No.
22:42
It's a short run situation. And what have I taught you about short
22:47
run? You have single.
22:50
Yes. So you have some costs. What have I taught you about short run?
22:59
Huh? We don't care about the cost.
23:01
I know. We don't We never care about the s costs. True. Which costs are some
23:05
costs? All the fixed costs are treated like sum
23:11
costs. Session number five remember. So which means in the short run we don't
23:19
take into account fixed costs. The case study clearly has said that hey
23:27
look at all the costs overhead is a fixed cost rest all of them are variable
23:36
costs it has said in the case study
23:42
cost where has it said
23:47
it's given in the case some pointer it's given in the
23:51
overhead mean Yeah. Yeah.
23:54
What does overhead cost mean? There are a variety of overhead costs.
24:02
Um extra
24:09
like utilities and stuff. Google find all sorts of overhead costs.
24:16
Give examples. Louder. Louder.
24:37
Advertising promotions. Okay.
24:41
So those all those things they're considering it as fixed cost. We can
24:45
fight. Hey, how can utility be fixed? We can fight. But if the company has told
24:50
us explicitly treat all those expenses as overhead as fixed then I'm not taking
24:56
that into situation which means in the short run I am only worried about
25:01
meeting my variable costs not my fixed cost. So I can let go of that figure. I
25:08
forget that figure. Okay. So which means I will never take into account overhead
25:13
costs. Right? And uh Joseph has given us example on what these overhead costs
25:18
could be. I don't know. Sony and Microsoft hasn't told me. Haven't told
25:22
me. They've only added them up. Okay. Which means costs per unit.
25:29
I'm sorry. Without overhead cost
25:31
without overhead cost. What all do I add for 8.75 units?
25:38
Labor raw materials and distribution. How much is labor
25:44
cost? 80. How much is raw material cost?
25:50
161. How much is distribution cost? 40. Total is
25:56
$281 per unit.
26:00
Which means total costs is
26:08
281 units multiplies one unit. But I'm making 8.75 million units.
26:17
So total becomes 45 8.75
26:20
245 Uh-huh.
26:24
million dollar.
26:28
So which means now I can easily compute my profit.
26:35
Profit is revenue minus cost.
26:41
How how much is revenue? 3491.25.
26:51
Cost is 2458.75.
26:56
How much is the answer? V2,
27:08
which means the very first profit when Sony is at
27:13
399, Microsoft is at 399, I make $1,000 million as profit. $1,32.5 million.
27:26
I want you to take 10 minutes in the class and finish the remaining matrix.
27:36
This is the only way you'll study. Complete the matrix in the class.
28:16
Ask me doubts. I'll come. Please let me know.
29:33
Okay, I went to the bathroom and I missed this part. What is Q?
29:37
Quantity of Sony. Quantity of Sony. Okay. So,
29:43
okay. So, then this will be QM if I'm doing the second story, right?
29:59
What is Java written all about them? Javier.
30:15
Good. Any more doubts?
30:17
No, that's it. Okay. Any other doubts, folks?
30:20
Yeah. I think all we did was for the US.
30:24
Yes. Yes. With this one and then with all the
30:27
rest. Yes.
30:33
try one then call me. Yes.
30:39
I just want to understand like how does it give numbers like
30:43
it's given in the case study that they're thinking about cutting the price
30:46
from 3.99 to 299. See at 3.99 to 299 it's given in the
30:54
case study. That's the money they are predicting.
30:58
How much money that how much profits they are getting?
31:02
It should be there, right? Yes.
31:07
1125. You don't look at this. You use your own
31:13
head. Go to exhibit number one. Guys, in your case study, you open exhibit number
31:19
one and use my board to see exhibit number two and three. I want the payoff
31:24
matrix. What happened to you?
31:28
No, my feet hurt. I twisted. Oh, what do you keep on doing?
31:35
What? What do you keep on doing?
31:39
You want help? Okay.
31:46
Make the payoff matrix. Make the payoff matrix.
31:50
Were you solving any doubts? Maybe the rock matrix.
31:59
Any doubts? Not exactly doubt. But I
32:06
Yeah, this is the third class to game theory.
32:08
This is my third class to game theory. Uh next class I'll again start a fresh
32:14
topic. You okay?
32:21
H no I surprise you to go.
32:26
So for uh this what should like should you like
32:31
buy two when Sony is selling at 399 and
32:38
Microsoft is selling at 399 which what do I look at over here? This
32:44
one. This one. So how much is Sony making? 8.0. Right down.
32:52
Can you calculate revenue now? Yeah.
33:08
Yeah. So with everything I go with this exactly revenue now becomes 3491.25.
33:18
Now look at costs. Write down costs. We look at which exhibit two or three.
33:26
Look over here. Two or three. Which one do I look at?
33:31
Two. Two. Okay. How much units are they
33:33
producing? 8.75.
33:35
8.75. So can I add the costs? Yeah.
33:38
Do you add all the tests? No.
33:41
So it is 80 + 161 + 50. So why do we remove? because it's a fixed cost and in
33:47
the short run we don't look at fixed costs. Okay, write down99.
33:57
Okay, right now we have calculated for Sony.
34:02
I want you to find the Microsoft profit also.
34:06
Find the profit for Microsoft. Guys, the first number was for Sony,
34:13
fine for Microsoft. Then Sony Microsoft. Sony Microsoft.
34:25
Who is asking me about? Any doubt? Okay. Exactly. So 281 into
34:36
beautiful. And the answer is 2458 75. Brilliant. Now what is profit
34:48
minus cost? Yes, it is 2 minus cost.
34:59
Done. Yeah. No, you can reduce from total. Go.
35:16
I I didn't hear you up until now. I finished this one first.
35:23
I think it's correct. I think it's correct. Go on. Make the
35:27
entire thing. Which one?
35:31
Which one? Any anyone? Finish them. Microsoft, find this one out.
35:36
Microsoft and I'll find this one out. No, this is Sony's payoff. I want you to
35:41
find Microsoft payoff also. Oh yeah, I'll find this one. Okay, I'll
35:44
find this one. Fine.
35:46
Fine. Any out?
35:51
I'm trying to I can teach you from the beginning.
35:57
Why I need out? Okay.
35:59
I know question. Why are we not Maybe it's a dumb
36:02
question. Why are we talking overhead if it's so? It's because um in the short
36:08
run they're only so they also know that cutting the price may look for lower
36:12
revenue. They're aware of that. So they're saying that don't worry about
36:15
meeting my overhead expenses. I'll meet it later.
36:18
Right now please cover for my labor raw material and distribution. That's all.
36:23
Those overhead are one time expenses. Marketing is a onetime expense.
36:28
Rent is a onetime expense. So they're like it's okay. That's all. Okay,
36:35
Javier, I know you like him too much. For now,
36:40
you will only do economics. Wake up.
37:00
No, I may have I should change the music.
37:03
Yeah. Yeah.
37:04
Yeah. I don't know. Tell me. Tell me. Where do you want
37:06
help? No. No. It's okay. I have it. I don't
37:09
know. I can teach you from the beginning.
37:12
No, no. It's a stupid thing. It's just to put
49:28
So, I already did the this one, the first one. Correct. But for the second
49:33
one, do I need like it's the one that is 399
49:39
and 29 to do it like these two? Yes.
49:50
Can you see that the problem is that generating more profit? So it's not an
49:53
equilibrium. There's still a balance. What is this game called?
49:58
Uh do strategy. in the real life.
50:05
But why is it happening? Why is there any more?
50:08
It's not. No, it's not.
50:14
It's where where is the more profits coming from?
50:20
Does this make sense? Does that make sense? It's okay. I'm
50:26
going to really
50:28
the video makes sense, but that doesn't happen in the real world. Why?
50:34
Yes, correct. On the right track. Finish the
50:39
last one. Folks, take two more minutes and then we
50:44
wrap up. It's not because it has a higher cost
50:50
than this one. So in reality is generating more profits compared to
50:55
which one generating more profit Xbox.
50:59
Oh that's not what I mean
51:07
for the first lesson in the morning. That's apt maths for the first lesson in
51:12
the morning. No this is the only way you will practice
51:16
and study with me. Yeah. Otherwise, I'll send you to the hostel and nobody opens
51:19
their notebook also. Yes, it's correct.
51:24
I'm proud of you. Yes. Really? Yes.
51:31
This is 186. Little mistake. Oh, this is correct. Okay. Okay. We'll just cross
51:36
check some numbers then we'll finish it up.
51:46
How much more time do we need? 10 minutes.
51:52
5 minutes. Okay. Fine.
51:56
Take Oh, no. I'll give you five more minutes.
52:07
My class is 12. not that lucky.
52:19
Hence if if it were in my hands then 12:30 Good.
52:49
Receive my Can you check our
53:17
Yes. Really? is it's correct. You're welcome.
53:25
Find the Nash equilibrium. Okay.
53:37
Pretty beautiful.
54:22
What's the Nash? Okay, correct. Yes. Find the Nash. You
54:27
didn't study Nash, Nick. What's the Nash? And like
54:32
I'll play you should be doing what's Yes.
54:43
Find the best numerical answer. It's a numerical answer.
54:51
How do you know Nash? I just Googled it.
54:54
Google. No. No. He googled the definition and he
54:58
saw you on his own. Yeah. Smart boy. Very smart boy. Good.
55:02
Now, what's the problem? It doesn't end there, Nick.
55:11
Okay. If you found the Nash, I'm telling you. What's that game called?
55:16
What's the game? Yeah. What's the entire game called?
55:22
I know it's 2x2. It's 2x2. It's There's a name to the game.
55:28
price. Three more minutes.
55:45
Game, that's still a better answer than what they're saying.
55:51
Thank you very much. He can Google. That's fine.
56:04
You can Google that. Is it working? Is the audio working?
56:11
Hey, monkeys. Don't be loud.
56:21
Kristoff, how much? No time. Almost done. Okay. At least he wasn't
56:26
there in class. Still needs a good answer even though he's googling. Look
56:45
mommy. Sorry. Sorry friends. I don't know why he's calling.
56:52
Funny if I pick up the call. You want
57:06
Okay, help me with the numbers. 1032.5. Next.
57:11
960. Can I have silence?
57:19
960 960
57:23
960 960 9 otherwise basically saying 9,000
57:42
how about I ask thank you Eden can you please volunteer others will listen and
57:46
if they're talking leave my class Thank you. 960.
57:50
Yes. I really don't appreciate it. Can we
57:57
shut up right now? Thank you. Next.
58:01
767.5 767.25.
58:05
Next. 012.5
58:08
1012.56.7. Anyone else with 1186?
58:20
Yeah. 1186. Okay. Next. 9785.
58:28
What? That one number was wrong. And
58:33
920. Okay. Now the people who were not there
58:38
in the previous class, oh yeah,
58:40
I'm going to solve for the Nash equilibrium.
58:44
And trust me, Google can't help you. So focus,
58:57
focus. Come back. How do I play the Nash?
59:01
When Sony sells the console at 3.99, Sony subjects itself in this direction
59:09
to these two boxes. Whichever box it lands on depends on
59:15
what Xbox would do. If Sony knew that, if Microsoft knew
59:40
if Sony knew it's playing at I'm I said next, you'll be out H right now. Sit
59:45
down. Anybody else? Get rid of that coldgate smile
59:53
when Sony sells at 399. Teaching you monkeys require so much patience, so
59:58
much bandwidth. Tell me the Nash equilibrium.
1:00:02
The fourth one. Very interesting. When Sony plays at
1:00:07
399, what will Microsoft do? It will go for one.
1:00:16
Is that clear? Jagat. Okay. When Sony plays at 299, what will Xbox do?
1:00:24
Jagat clear. Okay. Nick clear. When Microsoft sells at 3.99, what will
1:00:31
Sony do? Okay. Thank you people. And when Xbox
1:00:36
sells at 299, what will Sony do? Obviously, in the right minds, 200
1:00:43
million bucks more. Where are where are the double ticks?
1:00:50
This is therefore the Nash equilibrium. What is this game called?
1:00:57
Why is it a prisoner's dilemma? Because they're influenced by each
1:01:00
other. Any game they're influenced by each
1:01:02
other. They're in a box.
1:01:04
All games are in a box. Because they less profit because both
1:01:09
have lower price. Both of them are getting lower profits.
1:01:13
Just like my yesterday's when you all were murdering me. What was happening
1:01:17
when you murdered me? Both of them ended up confessing and going to the jail for
1:01:22
5 years. They could have gone to the jail for 2 years. That was their better
1:01:26
outcome. Over here the better outcome is to keep the prices high.
1:01:32
But yet in the real world given the prediction exercise you constructed a
1:01:36
payoff matrix. This is an empirical exercise you did from real financials
1:01:41
and predictions from the R&D department and you said hey I populated with these
1:01:45
num populated with these numbers it looks like both of them are going to cut
1:01:50
the price in 2009
1:01:55
when the recession was going on of course everybody was predicting a price
1:01:59
cut no one expected a $100 cut when the economists came and actually looked at
1:02:05
the financials downloaded the data from the R&D department did everything. Sony
1:02:09
and Microsoft gave them data. They took the data and they said, "Hey, it looks
1:02:13
like if you want to do a $100 cut, it looks like both the companies are going
1:02:19
to cut it by $100." Those two economists were the first ones to predict a $100
1:02:24
slashing cut. That's why the case study got published at Harvard hardwood uh
1:02:29
case study. It's a Harvard product what you all are looking at today.
1:02:33
How do you think so should better prices down like
1:02:37
As the time passes or they stay on they cut it. In fact as time passed they
1:02:42
cut it even more this is a prediction or did this
1:02:45
actually happen? This is was a prediction and in 6 months
1:02:48
it happened. They predicted this in July in December
1:02:52
this exactly happened. Now my question is all of you know in prisoners dilemma
1:02:57
you end up reaching the worst of output even though better of output you're not
1:03:01
choosing. Why in the real world are people
1:03:07
reaching the inferior output? Because they don't get to see the other
1:03:10
side. Because they lack trust.
1:03:11
Because they lack trust. They don't get to see the other party. Number one. Now
1:03:16
that is economics. That is behavioral economics that hey
1:03:20
this is trust issue, conflict issue. I don't trust. What if they end up cutting
1:03:24
the price? Because if they end up cutting the price, they'll get the
1:03:26
entire market share. I can't risk it. I am saying that's not the only reason.
1:03:31
That is the reason. That's not the only reason. Think of
1:03:34
more strategic reasons. Think of more strategic reasons why I may cut the
1:03:39
price. To get more
1:03:43
to get respond. Okay. To get more market market share. I
1:03:47
get it. What else? To respond to the economy which is
1:03:50
already Okay. Dear dear GMA, recession was going
1:03:54
on. I am expecting lower uh you know sales sales. So I probably cut the price
1:04:00
and I can invite more sales. I get it. That's why I tested for it. And yet it
1:04:05
makes lower profit. To kill competition.
1:04:07
What? Yet it makes lower profit. Why am I doing that then?
1:04:10
To kill competition. To kill competition.
1:04:13
Kill competition. There is no what kill competition. Both of them ended up
1:04:16
cutting the price. In fact, there is there's a Nintendo in the corner which
1:04:19
is looming on my head. Sell more units.
1:04:22
I did sell more units. I'm predicting to sell more units, but it's coming at a
1:04:26
cost. Coming at a cost of what? $60 million.
1:04:31
Why am I still doing it? Yes, trust is shoe. I get it. What else?
1:04:36
Brand reputation. Broad brand reputation.
1:04:38
Well, it's before Christmas. Like we already said it's recession and they
1:04:42
don't want the people to think, oh yeah, they sell it for
1:04:45
a good point. Okay. For that costed me $60 million.
1:04:50
I don't sell my competitor. That's what I don't sell cheaper. That's
1:04:54
why I'm having trust issues. That's the only reason why I'm cutting price.
1:04:58
What else? Louder.
1:05:03
There is a strategic reason why they're doing it. Think more.
1:05:07
If one cuts a price and the other doesn't, the one with the high price
1:05:11
might be seen. Correct. Correct. That's exactly what
1:05:14
prison's dilemma says. Think more. I know. Think more. Go beyond market
1:05:22
share. There's a Nintendo looming.
1:05:28
I know that. Think more for the brief period. They have an
1:05:31
unfair advantage. For a brief period, they have an what?
1:05:35
Nonsense. Because they want to keep up, not
1:05:39
letting Nintendo come in. Because they want to team up and they
1:05:45
don't want Nintendo to come in. I want silence. What JVR just taught you all is
1:05:52
called predatory pricing. I am talking to you about a pricing strategy. In such
1:05:58
situations where Nintendo is looming at the corner, they did not know at what
1:06:03
price point Nintendo was coming. Generally, when the industry is
1:06:07
attractive with profits, I would want to enter and make money. Sony and Microsoft
1:06:12
knew Nintendo is about to come. They slashed
1:06:17
then I misunderstood you. They slashed the price from 3.99 to $299. $100 slash.
1:06:24
Predatory pricing is a pricing strategy where you cut the price too much that
1:06:30
dattors competition to come in. Are you with me?
1:06:34
When do that is what monopolies do?
1:06:38
This is a duopoly case. Beautiful. That's exactly what economists also
1:06:43
ended up writing at the end of the story. It's not given in the case study
1:06:46
but they were discussing predatory pricing is a pricing strategy
1:06:51
where I cut the price too much and that deters the competition.
1:06:57
How is it called predatory? I behave like a predator.
1:07:02
I don't know how to say that now. Okay. I I don't know. More like uh I'm a what
1:07:08
what was what is a predator? Eats up the competition. Eats up the
1:07:13
inferior Yeah. inferior animals. So hence, wow, a
1:07:16
lot of question Eden. So hence predatory pricing. They thought now why it was a
1:07:21
failed activity. They thought Nintendo would run away. They thought they would
1:07:26
cut the price from 3.99 to 299 and Nintendo would run away. Nintendo said,
1:07:30
"Haha, Nintendo came back at a 249." So even though it's predatory pricing,
1:07:36
they thought it would help and they would cut the price, but it became a
1:07:39
failed activity over time. But anyway, step number one, trust issue. Otherwise,
1:07:44
market share will go to other people. I get it. Factor number two, predatory
1:07:48
pricing. That I'm detering other competitors to enter the market. There
1:07:51
is one more reason why I'm doing this. He had said it. He had forgotten. Think
1:07:55
more. Think more. Think more.
1:08:05
Think, think, think. There's one more major strategic reason why I don't care.
1:08:10
And I still go ahead with cutting the price.
1:08:21
I'm losing $60 million, but that's okay. Why
1:08:26
they want to launch the new version of the
1:08:31
no? In fact, the next launch was years later, three, four years. They want to
1:08:36
collectively get more audience or expand the market.
1:08:41
Why? Together.
1:08:42
Why? Because lower price invites.
1:08:44
I know that. But why? Um
1:08:48
pushing you to think instead of one company
1:08:50
that monkey there had said something. Can you put both arguments together?
1:08:56
I I don't know how you say it. Your brain.
1:08:59
Yes. Louder.
1:09:03
ecosystem. Oh, inside the game cells like not the
1:09:08
inside product. It's like ladies and gentlemen, is the mic
1:09:15
working? I don't think so. This is known as razor razor blade pricing.
1:09:23
I'm writing it again. No, I'm writing it for the first time.
1:09:27
Razor Razor blade pricing.
1:09:37
No, in razor razor blade pricing I cut calm
1:09:42
down. I cut the price of the product so that market share increases or more
1:09:49
people come and buy my products. Which means Sony and Microsoft were making
1:09:54
sure consoles or game stations are sold and adopted by every household. And
1:09:59
later they will make the money from the games.
1:10:03
Understanding? And later they will increase
1:10:06
later not increase later they will make the money from the games.
1:10:12
When you sell the console once it is there in the house for 3 4 years
1:10:18
and then every time you want to play games in that consoles you keep on
1:10:21
buying the games and that is where these companies end up making a lot of money.
1:10:25
make up money using complimentary goods. This is also known as complimentary
1:10:30
pricing. I have taught you complimentary goods. I have taught you marketing of
1:10:35
complimentary goods. This is the way you go about pricing. One of them gets lower
1:10:40
money. That's okay. I make the money in the second good. Are you with me?
1:10:44
Yeah. This is also known as razor razor blade
1:10:48
pricing. What's the razor? What the what
1:10:53
kind of when you use the same words to describe
1:11:01
the same word? Um what is it that men use to shave? Right.
1:11:06
Razor. Yeah. And the blades keep on changing.
1:11:09
So you sell the razor once but you keep on buying the blades again and again.
1:11:13
Just like how you sell the console once and you keep on buying the games again
1:11:17
and again. Are you with me? Okay. Okay. Now, do you want a break?
1:11:23
You want a break? 5 minutes.
1:11:30
No, it's finished. It's 5 minutes. 12:00 is 11:45. Oh,
1:11:43
11:45. I made a mistake. Okay, fine. Come back. I'll let you go. But next
1:11:47
class when we meet, I will tell you what Messi does on the field.
1:11:52
I use an accent. She asked me to use an accent. I use I will tell you what Messi
1:11:57
does on the field. Messi
1:12:00
Messi Messi
1:12:01
Messi Messi
1:12:03
Ronaldo Messi. We'll talk about their soccer penalty
1:12:07
kicks just for 5 10 minutes. That is the time when all of you will kill me. But
1:12:11
that's okay. After talking that we'll sit and study costs.
1:12:17
Okay. Thank you very much. I'll see you next week.
1:12:19
Thank you. Yeah.
1:13:06
Recording stopped. that I could follow and I just need
1:13:29
people. Can I have your attention? People, can I have your attention?
1:13:35
I need attention. 5 4 3 2 1. Now give me feedback. For example, when we study in
1:13:41
the class and I give you time, this workshop is better. No. that I give you
1:13:46
question, I give you time, I tell you what to do, you practice and learn
1:13:49
better. So we'll keep up with I'll try do I I'll
1:13:52
do my level best. We'll keep up with the practice sessions more in the class so
1:13:56
that you know in the class and then go out. Okay. Okay. Cool. So we'll
