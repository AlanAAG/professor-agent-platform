lack of something and pain point. I'll take both of these. Okay. Yes.
20:22

the word necessity. Okay. So need according to me. Okay. And for my next
20:33
30 habs of course. Wonderful. Okay. That's
20:38
exactly what I wanted to say. A need is nothing but all of you please listen.
20:42

going to miss it here then it's a problem. Okay. So a need according to me
20:57
and for my next 30 hours is nothing but a consumer's problem. Okay. said right a
21:05
consumer's pain point or a consumer's problem or a state of dissatisfaction a
21:13
momentary state of dissatisfaction by the consumer

Now thing is that is he aware that he is
33:31
single? Possibly so far no. But now I have come and said single single single
33:36
single single single single. Okay. So much that now he has become aware he has
33:41
a problem. Now only he will start to run towards someone. Okay. Are you able to
33:46
get it? Are you able to get it? So a problem is there in the customer.
33:51
Anybody here? Okay. Anybody here has a young kid at home? Okay. Your sister or
33:56
nephew niece who's still crawling? Anyone? Ah, you have. Now, what do
34:02
babies do? Only goal of babies is they walk around.
34:08
They crawl around everywhere. Whatever is on the path, they take it and put it
34:12
in their mouth. That's their life ambition. Okay. Now, do children have
34:17
the need to live or not? Yes or no?
34:21
They do. They do. Okay. Children because they are
34:26
living things. Okay. Children are living things, right? So they have a need to
34:29
live. They have the need to live. Yes. But do they realize that they have a
34:35
need to live? They do not they they do not realize
34:39
that they have a need to live. But the need is still there with the customer.
34:42
With that particular child, the need is there. Okay. Suppose if I'm going to
34:45
come and hold his nose and mouth tightly. Do does he have the need to
34:50
lift? He has the need to lift. Okay. But does he realize he has the need to do?
34:56
He does not. Till the moment you do not realize that you have a problem, that is
35:01
what is called as a latent need. That is what is called as a latent need. The
35:07
moment you realize that like you have the problem and it becomes an active
35:12
need. Okay. So, Children have the need to live boss. Children have the need to
35:16
live. Okay. But there are millions and millions of bacteria and viruses in
35:20
every particular toy that they are like putting on their mouth. Okay. So what do
35:25
you do as a parent? As a parent, you come and say if you put this toy in your
35:31
mouth, there are bacteria and viruses. You might fall sick and there's a chance
35:34
that you will die. What are you doing as a parent? Are you creating the need to
35:38
live? No, you are creating the awareness about the problem. That is the only
35:44
thing you can do as a marketer. Now if I block his nose and mouth at that moment
35:49
what happens? Ah he he's going to struggle at that moment he becomes aware
35:54
that he has the need to live but the need to live is always there. Got it?
35:59
Okay. So you cannot create a problem. All you can do is you can create an
36:05
awareness about the problem. As a marketer you cannot create a problem.
36:10
You create an awareness about the problem
36:19
and of course the second thing you can do is you can create
36:24
solutions better solutions. Okay, solutions to the problem. Are you
36:29
able to get it? How many of you know boss? Still I disagree with you. Please
36:33
feel free to disagree. Though we can create a need. Believe me,
36:38
if you prove that you can create a need, I will leave this profession and go and
36:41
beg also. Okay. I will not teach anymore. This is a chance to make me go
36:45
out. Uh he's trying to Oh, good. new.
36:53
That's okay. But how is that like a need that you're creating? What is the
36:56
consumer's problem that you're creating? That is okay. But that you're creating a
37:03
new a way of creating awareness. But you're not creating the problem. The
37:07
problem that lies within the customer. Okay. The customer should feel the
37:11
problem. Okay. Yes. How? Give me an example.
37:17
Huh? What is the problem? Okay. Give me an
37:23
example of the need. So the thing is that the need for
37:28
relaxation is always there with you. The need for comfort. For example, how many
37:34
of just I'm coming please if you raise your hand I feel bad. Okay, that is the
37:38
thing I have seen it. I I'll come to you. Okay,
37:41
now suppose you are very very sick. Okay, having 1023 fever. How will you
37:47
sleep? In what position will you sleep? Think about it. Having 102 103 fever.
37:53
Okay, in what position do you crawl and sleep? You know what is the position?
37:58
You will automatically go to this position called as a feal position.
38:02
Okay. You will like sleep like a baby. That is the most comfortable position
38:08
that we have known because that is how we have been in the mother's womb. Okay.
38:13
Wonder. Okay. So that is the most comfortable position that is known for
38:17
all of us. Okay. So when like you feel super sick, you will automatically go to
38:24
that position. That is why you see very old people, they also will start to like
38:28
move back to the position. Their body also start to shrink. So that is the
38:33
most comfortable position. That is the comfort that we need. Okay, that need
38:38
for that comfort is there. Now when you're using the mobile phone for a long
38:42
period of time, you get drained, right? You are not creating the problem. The
38:45
need for comfort is there. But the awareness that now goes I need comfort
38:50
because I'm burning out. That awareness is created in you. Not the need. The
38:54
need for comfort is always there. The need for comfort is there with the
38:59
customer. I told you right the need to life live is there with the child but
39:03
the child does not know that it has the problem the moment okay all of you co
39:11
that is the question ah every class this question comes wasn't a need created in
39:16
this moment also there are thousands and thousands of bacteria and viruses
39:19
floating around here why are you not putting a mask
39:23
why are you not putting a mask because you do not have the awareness okay you
39:29
do not All of us have the aware have the need to live. But when there was a news
39:33
that came out because there's a deadly virus circulating outside. Okay. You
39:38
became aware that I have to live. That is why you went for a mask. That is why
39:44
you went for a mask. All they created was the awareness about the problem, not
39:49
the problem itself. The need to live is always there. That's why I close your
39:53
nose. You'll become automatically aware like how COVID made you aware. Yes.
39:57
Boss. Yes, of course. Otherwise, like what
40:02
will till the awareness is there the customer will not start?
40:14
No, they they do tell. Okay, it's not about that. See, Netflix is not the need
40:19
for it's not the solution for the need for
40:22
loneliness. It is also for the need for entertainment. Earlier you were
40:25
entertaining by playing outside with your friends. Okay. Now, Netflix came as
40:29
a better solution that replaced playing outside. As simple as that. A better
40:33
solution will come and replace an existing solution. A better solution
40:38
will come and replace an existing solution. And that is exactly what you
40:42
have to be doing as an entrepreneur. If you want to be an entrepreneur, what is
40:47
the problem that you are solving? In many cases, you think that you're
40:50
creating the problem. You can never create a consumer's problem. You can
40:55
never create a consumer's problem. Yes. Yes, please, please, please.
41:18
Credit cards. Ah, the loyalty points.
41:33
It is solving a problem. It is it is solving a problem. Okay. See what she's
41:36
talking about is a mobile application which can help you pay your credit card
41:41
bills easier. Okay. That is what is called as credit. It is based out of
41:44
India. Okay. Is it one minute? Is it like solving a problem? Yes. What is the
41:51
problem there? convenience. As simple as that. Okay.
41:57
What is the problem it is solving? Is it's the need for higher convenience.
42:01
Okay. Earlier you were swiping the credit card. Now the application
42:05
replaced the credit card. As simple as that. Suppose you see boss, you have to
42:09
move from point A to point B. Yes or no? You have to move from point A to point
42:14
B. What is the need here? The need for transportation. You can walk,
42:22
you can run, you can take a horse, you can take a car,
42:28
you can fly. All these things are there. All these are different solutions to
42:32
your problem of transportation. Okay. Now the walk was the first solution. The
42:39
run came and replaced the walk. The horse came and replaced the run. The car
42:44
came and replaced the horse. the flight came and replaced the car. A better
42:50
solution will come and replace an existing solution. And that is what you
42:54
are going to do. You are going to come up with a better solution that will
42:58
replace an existing solution. Now, how do you come up with this better
43:01
solution? Yes. Which one?
43:14
Huh? Is bottled water a problem or a
43:20
solution? You tell me better beta. Okay. Is it a
43:25
problem or a solution? Solution. What is the problem? The
43:30
problem is thirst possibly need for hygiene and need for thirst. These are
43:35
the things and bottled water and need for comfort. And bottled water is a
43:39
solution for this. I told you it is not about essential and
43:47
advanced. I'm telling you it can be basic needs, it can be advanced needs.
43:52
But both of them are problems. Okay? If you look at a bottled water, it is a
43:57
solution. For example, if I'm going to keep you so much
44:03
blocked here, okay, for many days, you will drink anything cow urine also,
44:09
okay? Because if you start thirsty, okay, we even drink animal urine
44:14
because if the need is so strong we will drink anything or I say you go and look
44:19
at people from South Sudan they drink water from puddles where you will not
44:24
even pee in that huh
44:31
no the need is thirst it is not the bottled water
44:38
the need is thirst you bottled water is only one of the solution you You can
44:41
drink soda, you can drink gin, you can drink wine, you can drink uh brandy
44:45
whiskey. All these things are possibly even cow urine. All these things are
44:49
solutions to like this particular problem of thirst. Got it? Still
44:54
disagreeing with me. Where is it? Where is your discomfort coming from? Tell me.
44:57
Wait, wait, wait. Let me explain to him and then come. Yes.
45:07
Huh? because you are talking about okay I'm
45:17
telling you what is the problem I defined need as the problem and want as
45:20
the solution right in case of bottled water is it a problem or a solution
45:26
then how is it a need it can be I'm telling you what you're talking about is
45:31
the needs can be basic to advanced okay listen okay this is where there was this
45:37
guy called as mass law he came said all of our needs, listen all of you, all of
45:42
our needs can be broadly classified into five categories, right? What are they?
45:48
There can be a physiological need, a safety need,
45:55
a social need, a esteem need, and self-actualization
46:00
need. Right? Now, when you say bottled water, bottled water is a solution to
46:06
the physiological need called thirst. Right?
46:11
Suppose a girlfriend or a mobile phone is a solution for talking to your
46:15
girlfriend or talking to your mother. Mobile phone is solving this problem.
46:19
Okay. But both of them are problems only. Physiological need is also a
46:23
problem. And social need is also a problem. Possibly like a bottled water
46:29
is a basic want. Mobile phone is an advanced want. But they are not needs.
46:36
Are you able to get it? They're solutions. They are not problems. Got
46:40
it. Now, okay. Yes. What is the solution for a premium water
46:47
brand? Okay. Now, wait. What is the solution? Is a premium water brand a
46:53
problem or a solution? It's a solution. What is the problem?
46:57
That is what you have to ask. What is the problem? The problem is insecurity.
47:02
All of us are damn insecure. All wait. All of us are damn damn damn damn
47:08
insecure. I told you, right? Suppose our boy is getting a very hot girlfriend or
47:13
like ah yes, shut up. Okay. Very very very hot girlfriend or he's building a
47:21
huge castle palace and staying there or buying a
47:26
Rolls-Royce or buying a was water bottle and showing
47:31
off. Okay, that like a boss I am a very big guy. All these are solutions to this
47:36
problem of insecurity as got it. Yes. No, you're not creating new needs.
48:06
No, the thing is that all the needs have already been identified. You are
48:11
creating newer solutions, okay, to the problems or you are creating awareness
48:16
about the problems. As as simple as that, that is the only thing you do as
48:20
marketers. Okay? See many cases what happens is marketers think that they can
48:24
create a problem and you go and create a solution thinking you're creating a
48:28
problem which will never be taken up by the customer and that's why 99%age of
48:32
the businesses fail one of the reasons I'm stressing this again and again is
48:36
this many a times you lose you lose track thinking that like you
48:43
can create a problem you cannot create a problem all the problems listen all all
48:48
the existing problems of marketers are coming. All the existing problems of
48:53
marketers are broadly bucketed only into these five. Every problem of a consumer
48:59
can be broadly bucketed into these five. Okay? They are physiological, safety,
49:03
social esteem and self-actualization. You cannot show me a need outside this.
49:07
Everything is going to be here only. Okay? Now the one question is boss tell
49:13
me in which stage you are in currently physiological safety social esteem
49:21
self-actualization esteem whose esteem why are you wearing
49:25
a shirt then why are you breathing then okay why did you eat food okay why are
49:31
you sitting in this class so at a given point in time all the five needs operate
49:37
at a given point in time all the five needs operate
49:40
But one of the need dominates that is what is called as a preotent need. Okay,
49:48
that is what is called as a preotent need.
49:52
At a given point in time all the five needs are present. Okay, anybody who has
49:57
not had breakfast here in the class ah some idiot will be there. Okay. So are
50:02
you hungry? Yes. But then why are you sitting in
50:06
this class? So the thing is that the need for
50:11
knowledge that's the last thing okay is higher than the need for hunger that is
50:16
why hungry of knowledge okay the need for
50:20
hunger is higher than the need for knowledge that is the reason why she is
50:24
sitting now let us say if I am going to keep her her till night 10:30 what is
50:30
going to happen the need for hunger will overpower the need for any nonsense and
50:35
she will slap me and run for Yes or no? Are you able to get this?
50:40
Okay. At a given point in time only one need dominates. That is what is called
50:45
as a pre- potential need. Any questions? Still any questions? Okay. Yes.
50:57
Okay. Viruses on a computer. Listen. Is are scammers creating a virus and
51:02
creating a need? That's what our boy is asking. Are they creating a need? What
51:07
is the need? Need for safety is always there. Now the presence of this computer
51:13
v virus has heightened the need for safety. Otherwise you do not care what
51:17
pictures of you you have. Okay. But the need for but you are possibly having a
51:22
topless picture of yours. Okay. You are it's okay. All of us have. Okay. Now if
51:29
but for example but he is scared that like this picture might be going out but
51:33
currently he's not why because he is not aware of that problem but let us say
51:39
there is a virus out there okay that might take all of his pictures and post
51:43
it somewhere else at that time he's going to have like an awareness that he
51:48
has problem as awareness about the problem then he buys the antivirus till
51:53
like you have awareness about the problem you will not start to look for
51:57
solution Okay. Now I know that like you're still
52:00
like a now started to zone off. We will take a 5 minutes break. Go take a break.
52:06
Think still like I I give you one option. Okay. Come and prove me wrong.
52:12
Okay. That you can create a need. Yes. Which is on the priority. Yes.
52:23
What is the we'll talk after the break.
52:28
is all about like again like the need to show off
52:33

58:09
clean this part. Huh?
59:02
That's okay. Cool.
59:23
Settle down all of you. Yes.
59:31
I mean the awareness because now that you speak about that we don't
59:37
have that awareness then like you once you start to have the
59:41
awareness then you start to look for solutions.
59:43
Exactly. But that's the creation of your creation of awareness. need is
59:48
existing with you. I am triggering it.
59:52
Okay. What about blackmail?
59:54
What about blackmail? The need for security is there with you.
59:57
But when the person is blackmailing, okay, you are now becoming aware that
1:00:00
like you need that safety robot. Yes.
1:00:05
The need for life is there. No, the need that is there with you.
1:00:10
You want to live? No. No. All of us have the need for
1:00:14
life. But I become aware that my life will go.
1:00:17
So I am becoming aware of the need at that moment when the ground is there.
1:00:29
Yes, that's the closest. Think about it. Think about it. We will
1:00:33
talk about it. Huh?
1:00:36
Need of Okay. The need of com comfort. That is
1:00:40
the thing that is there. Okay. We'll talk about that.
1:00:44
Okay. Listen. Okay folks, settle down. Settle down.
1:00:48
Settle down, please. Yes.
1:00:53
Okay. See folks understand one thing. Okay. See,
1:00:59
you cannot create a need. That's a given. Okay. All you can do is you can
1:01:04
create an awareness about the need. That's the only thing you can do as a
1:01:08
marketer. And you can create better solutions. You can create better
1:01:12
solutions. I told you right. All of your needs so far, all the needs that like
1:01:17
you have can be broadly classified into these five categories. Okay, this what
1:01:29
is the Maslo's hierarchy of needs? Okay, every need of yours, every need that
1:01:34
whatever you are saying right, it can be broadly classified into these five
1:01:37
categories. Okay. So, physiological safety, social estactualization,
1:01:44
every need occurs. Okay. I completely agree with Maslo that there are only
1:01:49
five types of needs. But where I disagree with Maslo, this is where I
1:01:53
completely disagree with Maslo. Maslo said until the lower order needs are
1:01:59
satisfied, you will not think of the higher order
1:02:02
needs. This is where I completely disagree. Until the lower order needs
1:02:07
are satisfied, you will not think of the higher order needs. This is where Maslo
1:02:11
got it wrong. Okay. How many of you agree with Maslo? Yes. Until the lower
1:02:18
order needs are satisfied, I will not think about the higher order needs. You
1:02:23
everything depends on situation. Okay. That is the
1:02:27
huh. And that is where okay not necessarily
1:02:37
okay that is not necessarily that you will the lower needs should be met in
1:02:40
order to go up. For example how many of you have been to the sistine chapel. How
1:02:45
many of you have visited the cine chapel? Yes. Okay. You have seen all the
1:02:49
beautiful paintings. Now the of course the system chapel.
1:02:55
Okay. Now when Michelangelo went into the system chapel for seven years he did
1:03:00
not come out. Seven years he did not come out.
1:03:04
Okay. He did not care about food, water and all this other stuff. He was focused
1:03:10
only on like painting the walls. Okay. So for him the selfactualization
1:03:17
of the higher order need was much much much powerful than the lower order
1:03:21
needs. Let me give you an example. Okay. Now let us say
1:03:27
did you have your food? Okay. Let us say you have not eaten anything and you are
1:03:32
not eating anything till night 9 p.m. Will you be hungry or not?
1:03:38
Say suppose like you want to do an internship in like say Mckenzie or like
1:03:43
a Boston consulting BCG. Okay. And at night 900 p.m.
1:03:51
Tarun is sending a name saying BCG is coming for a summer internship. Anybody
1:03:57
who wants to apply can should have fulfill the form and the form has 40
1:04:01
questions. You're damn hungry and BCG is your dream
1:04:07
company. What will you do? Okay. And if you see
1:04:11
that like if you step out to buy food, the form will be closed because there
1:04:15
are 40 questions because the end at the end of the day you have to submit the
1:04:18
form. What will you do? Fill the form or like go buy food?
1:04:25
Fill the form. Okay, wait. I'll come. Okay, fill the form. Right. So, what had
1:04:30
happened? The higher order need was much powerful than the lower order need. The
1:04:35
only argument you will say is boss, I know that tomorrow I will eat food.
1:04:38
Okay. And that is why like I will go fill the form. That is what is your
1:04:42
argument? Yes. Uh what is your argument? Fine. That is why I said this is where
1:04:50
Maslo got it wrong. said till the lower order needs are
1:04:53
solved, you will not even look at the higher order needs. Okay, here I gave
1:04:58
you an example where you're looking at a higher order need of esteem or like
1:05:02
self-actualization because that's my dream job and I will forego hunger.
1:05:07
Okay, usually the argument that is made is listen folks. Usually the argument
1:05:11
that is made is okay because it is a short-term thing in the long term. Okay,
1:05:15
I will look for the physiological that's where it is wrong. Even in long term for
1:05:20
example many of your parents they might have sacrificed the food and other stuff
1:05:25
in order to ensure that you get a good education right
1:05:30
any of your parents would have done this okay in India once you come you can see
1:05:34
street builders okay people who are staying on the street they will not have
1:05:38
food but they will be giving their kids okay man or like they will be buying
1:05:44
clothes for their wife the higher order need of love social need is stronger
1:05:49
than like their own physiological need. Even in long term it holds in many
1:05:54
cases. Of course there are exceptions but predominantly physiological needs
1:05:58
dominate because they are body needs. They are body needs. Now all of you
1:06:03
listen how to win in your drop shipping. Now listen carefully.
1:06:10
Okay boss, you're saying that okay a better solution will come and replace
1:06:16
an existing solution. Okay, so far what I've said a need is a problem. A want is
1:06:21
a solution. Can you create a problem? No. You can create an awareness about
1:06:25
the problem and create a better solution. All the solutions that have
1:06:29
won are like better solutions. Okay. Now how do you create a better solution? How
1:06:34
do you create a better solution so that your solution come and replaces an
1:06:38
existing solution? Okay. Now listen.
1:06:42
Yes. I know I I I'll come to the base. But
1:06:48
before that, let me ask a simple question. Can there be multiple
1:06:51
solutions for one need? Yes. Now one day I told hungry pizza, pasta, paratha,
1:06:56
puri, whatever it is. Okay. All these are solutions, right?
1:07:01
Can one want solve multiple needs? Can one want solve multiple needs? Yes. For
1:07:08
example, how many of you use an iPhone here?
1:07:13
I should have asked who does not use an iPhone. Okay, iPhone. Now, let us say,
1:07:18
do you use an iPhone? Why do you use an iPhone?
1:07:21
So, you want to like FaceTime with your mom? Okay, Rich.
1:07:28
Now, our boy might want to show off. Oh, I am an Apple boy. Okay, I'm a what's a
1:07:34
rich kid kind of a just an S. Right? He might be using an iPhone
1:07:41
because he's having possibly some pictures of him and he does not want
1:07:44
that picture to go out. It protects. Okay. So very safety.
1:07:50
Our boy might be a tech geek saying that because I am a tech guy. Okay. Tech with
1:07:55
a lot of tech expertise and Apple is the only phone that is catering to my tech
1:08:00
knowledge. Okay. Today remove the iPhone from most
1:08:07
of you, you'll have withdrawal symptoms. Okay. So that is where it has almost
1:08:13
become physiological. Okay. So this is the reason why an iPhone or a smartphone
1:08:19
came and replaced a mobile phone. Okay. So what is the reason when you are going
1:08:26
to have multiple needs solved that will be a better solution which will replace
1:08:31
a solution which is solving a lesser number of needs. Okay. For example,
1:08:36
listen all of you listen carefully. This is something very important. You have to
1:08:40
move from point A to point B. What did I say? You have to move from point A to
1:08:44
point B. Earlier what were you doing? You were running.
1:08:49
Then the horse came and replaced the run.
1:08:52
Then the car came and replaced the horse. Right. Run. What was when you
1:08:58
were moving from point A to point B? What was the problem? The need was
1:09:02
transportation. The run was the solution to
1:09:06
transportation but the horse it was solving the problem need for
1:09:12
transportation and need for quicker transportation.
1:09:17
So faster transportation was added. That is why the horse was able to replace the
1:09:23
run. Car was able to replace the horse
1:09:26
because it was not just the need for transportation. Need for faster
1:09:30
transportation but need for convenient faster transportation. Need for
1:09:34
convenience was added together to the need for transportation already. And
1:09:38
that is why the car replace the horse. Okay. So when I say that as a marketer
1:09:43
you create a solution which will come and replace an existing solution and
1:09:48
okay what do you do usually you pl one or two for example I told you right when
1:09:53
suppose I had to communicate with her I was shouting earlier then the telegraph
1:09:57
came and replaced the shout then the telephone came and replaced the shout
1:10:02
telegraph and the smartphone or the mobile phone came and replaced the
1:10:05
telephone in telephone what was I doing for communication but in a smartphone
1:10:11
Need for communication and need for entertainment got added
1:10:16
because two needs were solved. That is why the smartphone came and replaced the
1:10:20
mobile phone. That is what like you have to be doing otherwise people will not
1:10:25
even give any [ __ ] about like whatever you're selling you product will start
1:10:28
and you flop. Okay. First things first understand you
1:10:34
cannot create a problem. Okay. Somebody was saying right what was you were
1:10:38
saying facts. What is only fans solving then not just loneliness it is all about
1:10:44
need for exhilaration the need for getting high
1:10:51
you can smoke and get high you can drink and get high you can watch an an adult
1:10:56
movie and get high talking to your girlfriend might get you high okay okay
1:11:01
getting an A+ okay in the examination can also get you high different
1:11:06
solutions are there which will solve this Problem of acceleration are you
1:11:11
able to get it? Okay. One only fans is only one of the solutions.
1:11:16
The need to like get a high that is the self-actualization need that is there
1:11:21
for everybody. It is there for this pro thing. Okay. You cannot create a
1:11:26
problem. Okay. All you can do is create a solution to the problem and can create
1:11:31
an awareness about the problem. How many of you still disagree?
1:11:37
Are you convinced? Start it, think about it and come for
1:11:41
tomorrow's session. Okay. Still the challenge is open. If you're able to
1:11:45
prove that you can create a need, I will leave this profession and go away. Even
1:11:50
to beg, but I will not continue. Okay, got it. Okay, great. Where is our single
1:11:55
boy? Ah, both of them are here. Let me take him now. Are you single?
1:12:01
Yes. Even after the break, useless fellow.
1:12:04
Okay, so after the break also. One minute. Yes. Tell me what is your
1:12:08
question that is that that is uh context
1:12:15
specifically we'll talk about that in so our boy is single are you aware that
1:12:20
you're single yes so awareness is also there are you looking for solutions
1:12:27
not it so the problem is not strong enough now if I'm going to come and
1:12:30
create more awareness you're single you're single you're single you're
1:12:33
single you're single what happens then he will start to run towards solution
1:12:37
let Let us say our boy starting to run towards solution. And let us say there
1:12:41
are three solutions out there. Option one,
1:12:46
option two, option three. Okay. Girl one, girl two, girl three. And don't
1:12:52
think say that like boss I am like objectifying women. I objectify like him
1:12:58
as well. Everybody just taking as an example. Okay. Just taking okay. Three
1:13:03
options are there. Girl one, girl two, girl three. Who are you going to run
1:13:06
towards? Nana, you have a problem.
1:13:10
No, I don't. That's okay. Suppose like you have a
1:13:13
problem and this is the solution. Who is he going to run towards? Who are you
1:13:16
going to? So, for example, he's hungry. There's a pizza, pasta, paratha. Which
1:13:20
is the option that he's going to run towards?
1:13:24
What is the meaning of that? Whichever he likes the most. Okay,
1:13:29
are you able to get it? There are three options. Which is the option he's going
1:13:33
to run towards? Girl one, girl two, girl three.
1:13:37
Huh? Yes. Now think about it. Are you able to
1:13:42
get that question? Yes. The best solution. What is the meaning of the
1:13:46
best solution? That is English. Okay. No. Okay. Of course, that is possible.
1:13:55
What is the meaning of that? Huh?
1:14:01
Okay. the bond with the least difficult to
1:14:04
achieve. Okay. Not necessarily. Okay. Yes. Tell me. Are you able to get this?
1:14:10
Okay. Some guys like challenges. Yes. Coming
1:14:15
from personal experience. Okay. Yes. Tell me quick quick which is the option
1:14:19
he's going to run towards. Ah. Come on. Don't use like jarens. Okay.
1:14:27
Like why are you talking about desires at all? Okay.
1:14:34
No. Okay. All of you are partly right but not completely right. I'll get you a
1:14:39
chocolate if at all you give the right answer. The one which has the highest
1:14:43
what? Huh? Okay. I get to you. One which has the
1:14:47
highest value. Okay. The one which has the highest
1:14:52
value. Now tell me what the heck is value? Yes, of course he's going to run
1:14:58
towards the option which has the highest value. I agree. Now what is value?
1:15:05
That is English value. Okay. What is marketing value? What is value?
1:15:12
Both. Okay. So other word for it. But what is value? How what is the meaning
1:15:15
of value? No. Okay. What is value? That's what I'm
1:15:21
asking. Okay. I completely agree. He will run towards the option which has
1:15:24
the highest value. Okay. But what is value?
1:15:29
Yes, boss. And
1:15:38
you're close. Okay. Again. Repeat. I thought like you got it. Okay. No.
1:15:47
Okay. It's not fully right. Okay. Yes. Are you sure? Is that just the benefits?
1:15:57
I'll take you for lunch if you finish it.
1:16:01
Benefits. That's all. If benefits is equal to value, why are they two
1:16:05
different words? No, lunch just cancel. Okay, so
1:16:13
least least cost. Okay, so value is nothing but I'll get a chocolate for
1:16:19
that, not like okay. Listen, listen, listen, folks. Please.
1:16:26
value is equal to sum of the benefits minus sum of the costs.
1:16:35
Value is nothing but sum of all the benefits that like you get minus sum of
1:16:42
all the costs. That is what is called as value. That is what is called as value.
1:16:47
Okay. For example, tell me folks why did you join Teta School of Business? Why
1:16:52
did you join Teta School of Business? Tell me quick.
1:16:57
Huh? What are the reasons? Huh? To travel. Okay. Okay. Travel. Fine. What
1:17:02
else? Knowledge. That's the last thing that
1:17:05
happens. Who asked for knowledge? Okay. Fine. Huh?
1:17:10
Brand. Friends. Okay. Friends. Then knowledge. Okay. Then skills.
1:17:18
Connections. Networking. What else? Mentorship. Okay. Wonderful. Now listen.
1:17:24
These are all the benefits that make you minus what is the cost.
1:17:31
Ah fees okay that is $100,000 fees. Then what else? Saving thing away from family
1:17:39
opportunity cost. Then getting up and like coming and sitting
1:17:45
in the stupid class physical cost. I've been continuously abusing our boy
1:17:50
for the last whatever that he has been single thing psychological cost
1:17:57
time cost. Okay. Now if you look at it fees is the
1:18:03
price you pay. Price is not equal to cost. Many of you think price equal to
1:18:08
cost. That's not fees is the price you pay. Price is in
1:18:12
fact a very small part of the cost. In fact one of the more insignificant part
1:18:16
of cost. There are other costs which are much much much much bigger.
1:18:20
So value is nothing but sum of all the benefits minus sum of all the costs. Now
1:18:26
let us say for a for example our boy okay had three options. Let us say our
1:18:31
boy had Harvard Business School of Business and also like where are you
1:18:37
from Canada? So like Montreal Business School.
1:18:42
Okay. He had admits from options which is the
1:18:47
option he would choose. What he will do is he will mentally calculate what are
1:18:52
all the benefits that I get from like option A minus what are all the costs.
1:18:59
Okay. And he will do this value calculation for all the options and he
1:19:03
will always pick up the option which has the highest value. Value is always
1:19:10
whenever you're choosing value should be always greater than or equal to zero.
1:19:14
You will never pick up an option which has a value which is less than zero. You
1:19:19
will never pick up an option which has a value which is less than zero. Are you
1:19:23
able to get it? Are you able to get it? That's what he would have done in his
1:19:28
case also. What our boy will do is he will say what are all the benefits of
1:19:32
going out with this person minus what are all the headaches of going out with
1:19:35
this person. Okay. And you will always pick up the option which has the highest
1:19:41
value. Are you able to get it? Okay. Are you
1:19:45
able to get it? Now that brings me to my next question. Can two products have
1:19:50
different values for the same consumer? Yes. Can the same product have different
1:19:56
values for the same consumer? Yes. Okay. Anybody in the class smokes?
1:20:03
Not a single person. The other class there were four or five smokers. Hey,
1:20:07
you smoke? Ah, let us say. Oh, does your mother know that you smoke? I will tell
1:20:11
her. Okay, that is why I asked. Okay. Now listen uh what is your name?
1:20:17
Vive. Where are you from? Which part of India?
1:20:21
Tala. Now let us say our boy smokes. Okay. Now after this class is mentally
1:20:27
screwed. Okay. And he wants to have relax. So he wants to go and smoke.
1:20:32
Okay. Now there is a shop just downstairs and there's a cigarette in
1:20:37
the shop which is say 15 a.m. Okay, there's a shop that is downstairs
1:20:44
and there's a cigarette which is 1580 and there is a shop that is let us say
1:20:49
800 m away and there is a cigarette in this shop which is 1580 same brand same
1:20:56
cigarette 1580 1580. Now which cigarette has higher value for our boy? The one
1:21:03
that is closer. The one that is closer will have a higher value. Why? Because
1:21:07
the cost is much higher. He has to travel and come back. Yes. Now this is
1:21:12
situation one. Come to situation two. His mother is standing downstairs near
1:21:19
that shop. Okay. Now which is the cigarette that will have a higher value?
1:21:24
The one that is away. Okay. So same product in two different situations have
1:21:30
different values. That is why value is always felt or
1:21:37
perceived. Okay. value is always perceived. Okay, what is the meaning of
1:21:43
it? Okay, what is the meaning of it? Perceived value, what I feel is value is
1:21:49
nothing but sum of the perceived benefits minus sum of the perceived
1:21:53
costs. What I feel is what is value. Okay. So value will be very different
1:22:01
for different people for the same product. Okay. at the same time for for
1:22:05
the same product in different situations value will be different for the same
1:22:09
person. Are you able to get it? As a marketer,
1:22:13
are you selling solutions? No. As a marketer, listen. As a marketer, are you
1:22:20
selling solutions? No. What is this first marketer doing? The first marketer
1:22:24
is coming and saying these these are the benefits that I am proposing. These
1:22:28
these are the costs. The second marketer is also coming and
1:22:32
saying was these these are the benefits that I'm proposing these these are the
1:22:35
costs or this marketing is proposing value one this marketer is proposing
1:22:41
value two and you will always choose the option which has the highest value
1:22:49
proposition. This is the meaning of the word value
1:22:52
proposition. Okay. He said right keep the phone away. Okay. He said that
1:22:58
marketers have to a higher value proposition. What are they saying? This
1:23:03
is exactly what they are saying. Okay, so marketers, okay, not just sell
1:23:08
products. They come and propose value and you will always pick up the option
1:23:17
which has the highest value proposition. You'll always pick up the option which
1:23:29
has the highest value proposition. Are you able to get it now?
1:23:34
Why is this even important? Tomorrow when you're sh then you say that okay
1:23:39
boss like now I have to come up with a better product. Suppose I cannot come up
1:23:43
with a better product. I'm coming up with the same product. How can you make
1:23:46
your product sim? You have to propose a different value.
1:23:51
How do you increase value? How do you increase value?
1:23:56
Either increase the benefits or reduce the cost. But how much should you
1:24:01
reduce? Listen. Listen. Now all of you listen. This is something very
1:24:05
important. This is the crux of like a how do you sell a good drop. Okay.
1:24:10
Suppose there are two options. Let us say option A and option B.
1:24:15
There are two products. First the product has a value one
1:24:19
V_sub_1. Second product has value V2. two products which is value one and
1:24:24
value two. Now suppose the first product has to stand out compared to the second
1:24:29
product. What is the meaning of it? Value one should be greater than value
1:24:33
two or benefit 1 minus cost one should be greater than benefit 2 minus cost 2.
1:24:43
Yes. Or if I transpose
1:24:47
benefit 1 minus benefit 2 should be greater than cost 1 - cost 2.
1:24:53
or delta V should be greater than delta C. What is the meaning of this?
1:24:59
The benefits that you're going to propose with your product should be
1:25:03
substantially higher than the incremental cost. What is the meaning of
1:25:07
it? I want all of you to listen for next two minutes. Very very very important.
1:25:11
Listen. Suppose there are let us say our boy is like selling a mobile phone.
1:25:15
Okay? Let's say the price of the mobile phone is 10,000 dirhams.
1:25:21
Okay, price of this mobile phone is 10,000 D. This is the cost.
1:25:28
The benefit our boy is proposing is say 15,000 D
1:25:34
for option A. What is the value here? Benefits minus cost 5,000 D.
1:25:44
Suppose she is going to launch a new mobile. Okay, cost is take 12,000 ms
1:25:54
what should the benefit she should have so that this shift what should be B2
1:26:04
so 17,0001 let us say 17,0001 is 5,0001 dhams so
1:26:11
the C value is higher V2 is higher will a customer shift no
1:26:17
the customer won't shift Okay. Even though the benefit is higher,
1:26:22
customer will not ship. Even though the value is higher,
1:26:26
customer will not ship. Why? Because the cost has gone up by 2,000. But the
1:26:31
benefit should not go up just by 2001. It should go up substantially higher.
1:26:36
Because whenever you are introducing a new product, what will the customer say?
1:26:40
Oh, this is $10 extra. It's just giving $12 of extra benefits. Okay. cost will
1:26:47
be very very very high. Even you say 2,000 DS extra a 2,000 DS. You are
1:26:53
saying 3,000 DS of extra benefits 3,000 of extra.
1:26:58
Okay, benefits that is how perception works. Okay, benefit should be
1:27:03
substantially higher than the cost. So what should be the benefit then? 18,000
1:27:08
then also it will not sell. It should be 20 22,000. Your delta B should be much
1:27:14
much much much higher than the delta C otherwise customers won't shift. Are you
1:27:21
able to get this? Are you able to get this? How many of
1:27:24
you lost it here? Think about this uncover. Okay, we will discuss this in
1:27:29
the next class. Are you able to get it? So what did we say? We said that like
1:27:33
boss a need is a consumer's problem. You
1:27:38
cannot create a problem consumer's problem. All you can do is you can
1:27:41
create an awareness about the problem. Of course you can come out and create
1:27:45
better solution and all these solutions are called as wants. As a marketer
1:27:51
you have multiple marketers are going to create multiple wants. But which is the
1:27:55
one that the customer will pick up? The one sorry the one that has the highest
1:28:01
value. Now what is value? Value is sum of all the benefits minus sum of all the
1:28:06
costs. customers will pick up the solution
1:28:10
which has the highest value. As a marketer, are you coming and selling
1:28:15
solutions? No, you are just proposing value. When you said I want to have a
1:28:21
different product, what is the value that you are going to propose?
1:28:26
If you do not show a higher value proposition than the existing product
1:28:30
out there, believe me, how much of performance marketing advertisements you
1:28:34
run, it will not sell at all. Huh?
1:28:39
What do if you do see
1:28:45
what is the benefit that show okay so then the investor should get
1:28:58
convinced that the value will go up after like 15 years for example in
1:29:01
Amazon's case it's a beautiful question okay 25 years Amazon had to wait to turn
1:29:06
profitable but if you have such an investor fine but uh will you get that
1:29:10
kind of an investor then like you have to convince that we will talk in
1:29:14
subsequent classes okay are you able to get it as a marketer you just propose
1:29:19
value okay and consumers will always pick up the option which has the highest
1:29:25
value proposition still we have not ended it after choosing what is our boy
1:29:31
going to do that we'll see next class bye-bye see you tomorrow.
1:29:39
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

Dr. Bhupesh Manoharan
3:35
Can you summarize what we have done in the last three
3:40
hours? We had two sessions. Okay. What is the objective of this course? Why the
3:47
hell are you even sitting in the damn class? There should be a purpose, right?
3:52
What do you think is the purpose of this course? To study what?
3:56
That's too generic. Boss after 3 hours needs and gaps in the market.
4:01
No, see again like is it about identifying needs and gaps? Okay, don't
4:05
think from the framework's perspective. And this is a question that all of you
4:09
please now like you have read the case, close it because this is a case
4:12
analysis. There's no need to even make notes. I want all of you to just listen
4:16
to me. Now this is one question each one of you
4:20
should ask every faculty who walks in why the hell should I sit in your class?
4:27
Why do I even have to sit in your class? And any and every faculty this is not a
4:32
class this is not an obnoxious question. It's a very rightful question and every
4:37
faculty should be able to convince you why you have to sit in this class.
4:41
Otherwise believe me 1 and a half hours you can go and enjoy okay play games or
4:45
like watch movie or like sleep it's a productive time
4:50
if suppose you are going and going to come and give me one and a half hours of
4:54
your time I should be able to convince you people okay finish the case uh close
4:59
it and keep huh use the fellow okay why you should be sitting in this class
5:07
now tell me what is the objective of this course I will tell you what is it
5:13
but you tell me what is the objective of this course why are we even studying
5:17
this course yes to understand the best of
5:23
the best of see
5:28
again you are thinking only from an the framework perspective don't be a slave
5:33
of the framework okay otherwise you'll remember framework after framework you
5:38
will not get can Someone summarize what we have learned in the last three hours
5:43
in two sentences in two or three sentences. Can someone
5:48
summarize? Yes. How to come up with good products and
5:51
services? I never talked about products and
5:53
services so far. Okay. Is it about just selling? Is it isn't it
6:00
too generic? Then again, you're going back to the
6:04
framework. Yes. understand if at all you had said this before this
6:12
three hours it is fine right because it is too generic statement to understand
6:15
customers everybody wants to understand customers be a bit more specific
6:21
to um learn the we learn the needs and the wants
6:27
and the five needs again understand wait again what you're doing is you're going
6:33
back to the framework That is what is running on in your head.
6:37
That is not what how you present to a investor or like you are presenting to a
6:42
recruiter. Right? You have to now tell me what you learned in one sentence not
6:50
about frame need that is okay but what is the crux of this learning and that is
6:56
something that you should be able to tell not for my course alone for every
6:59
course. Yes.
7:01
Trade office. H where is it? Offers is one way of
7:06
promotion. I'm not talking about that alone. Right.
7:10
Is it just about pitching? But what are you pitching? Yes.
7:16
Huh? See this is again a generic statement.
7:21
Everything you are learning to apply in real life. What is the purpose of
7:23
learning then? Yes or no? You have to use it somewhere. What is it that like
7:29
you're studying? Yes, boss. Again, this is super generic, right?
7:39
Huh? Is it just about satisfying a consumer?
7:56
Come back. Okay. Yes.
8:00
So to understand the logics of how the consumer's mind works.
8:04
Not that we have still not studied. Okay. That is in the second course.
8:08
Okay. Yes. To know how to
8:13
business idea and at least like now you're halfway
8:18
around. Now listen the purpose of this course and this is a question you have
8:24
to ask every faculty. I'm telling you I am myself saying I am the director of
8:27
faculty at like masters union. Okay. I am telling you to every faculty be it
8:32
Gara or like be it like a whoever like is coming and teaching but why the hell
8:37
are we studying this damn course? Why why are we studying this course? You
8:42
tell me that first then we will teach. The purpose of this course is to create
8:48
a go to market strategy. What is the meaning of that? You are going to the
8:55
market. Market means what? Market means what? consumers. You're
9:02
going to the market means you're going to the consumers with what?
9:06
With the idea. You're going to the market. Okay. With
9:12
an idea. And what is the strategy part of it? Just going to the market with an
9:16
idea. What is the objective? To
9:22
make money. That's all. As simple as such. The purpose of this course is how
9:29
do you come up with an idea and try to take it to the market and make profits
9:36
out of it or make money out of it. That is the reason why we are studying this
9:40
course. Understand that first if you get that then like the course is going to be
9:45
easier. Okay. The purpose of this course is how
9:49
do you come up with an idea and take it to the market. market is consumers and
9:56
make money from them. That is the purpose of this course. Okay. Now, how
10:01
do you come up with an idea? That is what we saw in the last three sessions.
10:04
So, three hours. Okay. How do you come up with an idea? An idea is nothing but
10:10
a problem coupled with a solution. Okay. Now, how do you
10:17
go? No attendance for you. Go. Did you read the case?
10:22
What is the point of coming? Go. Okay. Sit. Useless fellow.
10:29
Somebody has gone. Okay. Now the purpose again I'm repeating the purpose or the
10:35
object. Don't write it boss. Okay. Please don't write. Why I'm telling you
10:38
why? Because you should internalize that.
10:41
That is the same thing with every course. I'm telling you that is the same
10:45
thing with every course. If you start to write, you will forget. You write it in
10:51
your head. Why? Why is this idiot coming and
10:55
talking? Okay, because like we are trying to understand how do we come up
11:01
with an idea and then try to take the idea to the consumers and make money out
11:06
of it. That's all. As simple as that. Now, how do we come up with an idea?
11:11
What did we say is an idea? An idea is a a problem
11:17
and a solution. A combined or pro problem coupled with a solution. How do
11:22
you come up with an idea? That is where we studied the entire need gap analysis.
11:26
Okay. The need gap analysis was done to come up with an idea.
11:32
Okay boss, now you have come up with an idea. Robert Bennett also came up with
11:36
an idea, right? Bob Bennett, you know that Robert
11:40
becomes Rob which becomes Bob in US. US are crazy people. Okay. Similarly, how
11:46
William will becomes that's how Bill Clinton came. Okay. His name is William
11:51
Clinton. Okay. So Bob Bennett also came up with an idea.
11:58
The moment you have an idea, can you just go to the market?
12:02
Go to your consumers. Okay.
12:06
So that is exactly what we are going to do. Okay. How? Now you have come up with
12:10
an idea. I have taught you how to come up with an idea. Now how do we take the
12:14
idea to the market? First let us see how did Bennett take the idea to the market.
12:20
Okay, that is what we are going to see today. Okay, see this is your first
12:25
business case class. So I will do this case analysis because you do not know
12:31
how to analyze a case. That's okay. I will do this case analysis. The next
12:36
case analysis also I will do. After that from the third case onwards you will
12:42
start to do the analysis. I will ask you to come and do the analysis. Okay. Now
12:47
today since it's a case analysis session, you need not open anything and
12:51
write just listen how I am analyzing the case. Okay. Now tell me what is Bob
12:59
Bennett's problem? Now you people can say okay just the case facts. What is
13:04
Bob Bennett's issue or what what is Bob Bennett's dilemma? Anyone? Yes.
13:10
He doesn't know who to sell. He does not know who to sell. Is that
13:13
Bob Bennett's problem? Huh?
13:20
The college administration do not want to buy it. Okay. What else is this
13:25
problem? Low margins. Okay. So, that is the
13:29
reason why investors are not willing to invest. What else? What else is
13:33
Bennett's problem? Yes, boss. He does not have a brand. Okay. He's a
13:38
no. No one. He's an unknown person. Yes. Experience.
13:41
It's a lack of experience. That's what she
13:44
said, right? No brand means what? Lack of experience. That is why it's a new
13:47
product. Nobody's willing to trust the product. Yes.
13:50
Same thing. Is that Bennett's problem? What is Bennett's problem? Yes.
13:56
Doesn't know how to pitch. He does not know how to pitch only.
13:59
Okay. So, that is the reason why he's suffering. Yes. What is Bennett's
14:04
problem? Now, let me summarize the case first. Now, all of you have read the
14:08
case, but let me again summarize the case once. No need to write. Listen.
14:11
Okay. I want you to understand how to analyze the case. Now, Bob Bennett is a
14:17
very nice guy. Okay. One fine day, Bob Bennett wakes up and goes to his wife
14:24
and says, "Boss, I am going to sell our vacation home
14:30
and all of our other assets." She's asking, "Are you crazy?" "No, no, no,
14:36
no. I'm going to sell this and make $50,000."
14:39
Okay. What are you going to do with this $50,000? I am going to start a business.
14:46
What nonsense business? No, no, no, no, no. I have come up with nice idea.
14:52
What was the problem? In the last one year alone. Okay. There have been 1600
14:58
fires in the US. Where? In the college dorms. Why? Students don't care. They
15:06
want to burn the place down. Okay. like how you people want to given a chance
15:10
okay now and when is this case happening that is also something you have to know
15:15
1987 but till today the case is a relevant case that's why I have put this
15:19
case okay in 1987 1600 fires have happened in college dogs why are the
15:26
fires happening why are the fires happening
15:31
unauthorized because the students are using a hot
15:34
plate okay the students are using a hot plate. Why are they using a hot plate?
15:39
So that they can heat and eat their food. Now what is this hot plate doing?
15:45
This hot plate, listen all of you, both of you, you can read the case later.
15:49
Listen to me. Now, now the hot plate is actually drawing 20 ampers of current
15:56
while the entire wiring is equipped for only 10 amp of current. So when 20 amp
16:02
of current is going to flow, what is going to happen? the wires are going to
16:05
melt and they're going to catch fire and that is how all these fires are
16:09
happening. So what did Bennett say? Bennett said
16:13
was I have a unique solution for this problem. Means I have an idea. What is
16:19
that idea? I am going to come up with a micro fridge.
16:23
It is some refrigerator a freezer along with a microwave oven.
16:29
And it is the microwave and the refrigerator are connected by a switch.
16:35
At one point in time either the refrigerator will work or the microwave
16:39
will work. Okay? Why? Because the switch will be alternating.
16:43
So what you can do is you can keep some food in the microwave in the
16:47
refrigerator and you can heat the food in the microwave and then eat it. Okay.
16:54
Why? And the switch here will allow only 10 amp of current. So that the system is
17:00
protected. Okay? Or the hostel will not burn.
17:06
Is this a good idea? We do not know. He went to the investors and said, "Boss, I
17:12
have this idea. Do you want to fund this idea?"
17:16
The investors said, "Go screw yourself." Okay? Like we are not funding this. Why?
17:22
Because the margin is too less. Okay? And they said like we you are a very
17:27
inexperienced guy. We do not want to handhold you. Okay. We do not want to
17:32
fund you. Okay. No way. Go away. Then he went to some other
17:40
individuals who are the manufacturers and he says I do not have a factory. Can
17:46
you manufacture this micro fridge to me? Most of them said no we will not do
17:52
this. But one manufacturer Sano said yes we will do it for you but you have to
17:59
upfront pay the cost of the dice jigs and everything that is $170,000
18:09
17 but even if he sells the holiday home he will make only $50,000 investors have
18:13
said no for the extra amount of money he needs
18:17
not only that Bennett also needs another $300,000 to run the business for one
18:22
year and $60,000 for legal fees and stuff. That's a huge amount of money he
18:26
requests. No investor has said yes for Bennett. Okay, investors and
18:31
manufacturers are done. Bennett went and talked to some college students.
18:36
College students said, "Boss, we are not going to buy it, but we can rent it."
18:41
Okay. At a $75 per year rent, okay, 52%age of the students said, "We will
18:47
take it." At the $50 per year rent 90%age of the
18:52
students said like we will take it but students are like a like you you're also
18:57
students you'll say one thing today tomorrow you'll say hey when did I say I
19:00
did not say okay that is the kind of an individuals you are okay
19:05
like you said that you'll read the case and come yesterday none of you read the
19:09
case and came useless fellows okay now who is then going to buy this microf the
19:15
college administration and the dom administration they should be the one
19:18
who should be buying Right? They said no no no no we are not going to why we do
19:23
not want our students to cook and waste their time. We want them to study. So we
19:28
are going to buy like a computers for them. We are not going to like buy this
19:34
microf nonsense. Moreover, the students might opt out of
19:38
the meal plan. So we do not want them to go out of the plan. Okay. And you are
19:42
saying that like this microf thing will last for seven years. Okay. But you are
19:47
a newbie. It might not even last for 3 years.
19:53
Then Bennett went and talked to some motel
19:58
guests. Motel guest. Yes. If at all there's a
20:02
microf there, okay, we will pay some $3 per night extra. But they are not the
20:07
ones who are going to buy it. They are the ones who will pay the rent or the
20:10
extra rent fees alone. Who's going to buy it? Motel owners. But Bennett did
20:15
not have the time to talk to motel owners.
20:20
Finally, Bennett comes to his wife and says,
20:23
"Boss, I'm going to start this business."
20:31
Wife is saying, "Are you crazy?" See, when your wife says something,
20:39
listen to her. She's always right. And when your wife is a banker, she's
20:44
200%age right. Okay. And Martha Bennett's wife is a banker and she says
20:50
who is going to fund this stupid idea? Even if you get this funding, okay, like
20:56
tomorrow any other competitor might come any new player can come in easily, a big
21:01
player or a small player. Why do you want to leave your like job
21:07
and start this business? You have a stable job now. Why do you want to leave
21:12
this job and start this business? Yes or no?
21:18
Now Bennett is in a dilemma. This is what is Bennett's problem. Should he
21:23
start the business or should he not start the business?
21:28
Now tell me after listen this is the summary of the case. I'm not doing any
21:31
analysis. I've just summarized the case. Now tell me how many of you here are a
21:36
yes for Bennett? Yes, boss Bennett has to go ahead and start this business. How
21:40
many of you are Yes for Bennett, right? Raise raise. See, in my class, take a
21:44
stance. Don't sit on the fence because my fences are bobbed. You know where it
21:48
is going to hurt you. Now tell me who is a yes for Bennett. Race raise honestly.
21:54
One raise properly. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. So eight fools are yes for Bennett. How
22:03
many of you are no for Bennett along with me?
22:07
Okay. Oh, we are a democratic world. So, no wins. Okay. Yes. Ace lose. Okay.
22:16
One more time. I'm asking who's the yes alone for Bennett. Yes for Bennett.
22:21
Raise. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 people. Nine. Let me try to come and convince these
22:30
nine fools. Okay. to say a no for Bennett. Can I let's try to see like can
22:36
I convince these nine people. Okay. Now what I'm going to do is I am going to do
22:41
something called as a stakeholder analysis. We'll try to look at the
22:46
different stakeholders and then can I convince these people to say a no for
22:51
benefit. Okay. Now who are all the different stakeholders in this case?
22:55
Listen and no need to write this folks. Please
23:00
listen because this is a case analysis. Okay, there is the learnings alone. You
23:04
have to make notes. This one you listen. How do I analyze the case? How do I take
23:08
the case? Now, if you look at the stakeholder analysis, who are all the
23:11
different stakeholders in the case? When you are married, who's the most
23:15
important stakeholder? Wife.
23:18
Wife is the better half. So, wife and Bennett are the most important
23:23
stakeholders. Okay? Wife is the better half. Then there is somebody called as
23:28
the college students. Right? I am just writing down every stakeholders
23:33
mentioned in the case. Okay. Then there is somebody called as the college
23:37
administrator. Yes or no? Then there is another administrator who
23:44
the dom administrator. In the college itself there is a college
23:48
administrator and there is a dom administrator. Two administrators are
23:52
there in the case. If you look at it, then you have the motel owners.
23:59
Then you have the motel guests, right? Then you have the manufacturer,
24:07
right? All of you keep your phones away.
24:12
Who's the manufacturer? San then like you have the investors.
24:19
Who are the investors? ECS, the venture capitalists, right?
24:25
Then there is also mention of retailers and distributors. Okay. In the case,
24:29
right? Then there is also the National Fire
24:41
Protection Agency which comes and like which recorded the,600 fires. Okay.
24:45
Which comes and extinguishes the fire. National Fire Protection
24:54
Agency. Of course, there is also the regulators, the government which is
25:00
bothered about the fires. Then finally, as the wife was saying, a competition
25:07
competitors might come in. Yes or no? These are all the stakeholders that are
25:11
given in the case. I've written all the stakeholders in the case. Now let me ask
25:15
is wife a yes or no for Bennett? Wife is a strong no. Okay. So if Bennett
25:22
is not going to listen to her and going to start the business and he's not just
25:26
going to go bankrupt. He's going to become a devotey. She is going to throw
25:30
him out and like go away. Why should he suffer? Now college students, college
25:37
students are they yes or no for Bennett? Yes. But these are students like you.
25:43
Today they will say something. Tomorrow they will come and say hey when did I
25:47
say I never said this. Okay. But like still say they are yes for Bennett. We
25:51
will take it. College administrators they are a strong no. No way. We are not
25:58
buying it. Okay. We are going to go for computers. Dom administrators they are
26:04
also a very strong no. Motel owners. No, we don't know because
26:10
Bennett did not talk, right? We don't know about these people.
26:15
M hotel motel guests, they said yes. Hey, are you listening or
26:19
not? No, no, no, no. Everywhere. Yes. They said they will pay $3 per ride, but
26:23
they will not. They said they did not buy the bike. They will rent it. Okay.
26:27
Pay extra $3 alone. San
26:32
said yes. But provided Bennett pays up that $170,000.
26:36
That is when San said yes. investors
26:41
they said no boss you are a stupid guy okay with the stupid idea okay like a
26:46
retailers and distributors we don't know
26:52
the national fire protection agency this also we don't know regulators this also
26:58
we don't know competition that also we don't know tomorrow it might come it
27:02
might not come that is what is one of the biggest concerns of the wife
27:06
competitor might come Now tell me who are the ones who should buy this microf.
27:12
Okay. The ones who are going to buy the microfil are these three people.
27:17
Okay. If at all somebody has to buy the microf it is these three people. College
27:21
administrator and the dom administrator. They have said no for the stupid idea.
27:26
Okay. Motel owners we don't know. We don't even know first that many motels
27:31
are there. Okay. So you come up with an idea and
27:35
there is no customer for the idea that is when it is going to flounder.
27:40
How many of you are a yes for Bennett still?
27:48
Stupidity is a crime. Okay. But it's fine. Okay. Raise raise properly. Yes.
27:52
We take a stance. 1 2 three. Only three. All the others have got redeemed. You're
27:57
still a yes for Bennett. Okay. Fine. Like now let us try to convince these
28:02
four idiots still like can I convince them to say a no. Okay. Yes or no? Okay.
28:09
Now we just did a stakeholder analysis. Okay, you're still saying a yes for
28:13
Bennett. Wait. Now let us say it's okay. Now
28:20
if suppose Bennett has to start this business.
28:23
Okay. If Bennett has to start this business, how much money does he
28:28
require? What is the total cost of starting this business? That is there in
28:33
the case, right? All these things are there in the case. So listen, what is
28:38
the total cost of starting this business?
28:41
First, if Bennett has to start this business and run for one year.
28:46
Okay. How much money does he require? $300,000.
28:50
This is the office cost, employee cost, and everything. $300,000. Yes or no?
28:57
Yes or no? And Bennett has to upfront pay Sano.
29:02
Okay. The car. Wait, close it. So Bennett has to upfront pay Sano. Okay.
29:09
The fees for like baking the cast, dice, dicks, everything, right? So that is how
29:15
much? $170,000.
29:19
There is also another cost mentioned. What is it?
29:22
The legal fees. What is the legal fees? $60,000.
29:28
Bennett has to eat and sleep right at least for one year. Let us add another
29:33
$10,000 for that. This is a personal cost of maintaining
29:38
his home. $1,000 at least are needed for every month. Okay. So, how much is the
29:43
total money that Bennett requests? $540,000.
29:50
If he sells the holiday home, how much is he going to get it? $50,000. Where is
29:56
he going to get the remaining $480,000 or 490? Huh? Casino.
30:00
Casino. Huh? All of your gamblers. Okay. So where is Bennett going to get the
30:05
$480,000? The investors have said that no this a
30:09
stupid idea. Okay, you are the only ones who are convincing standing with
30:13
Bennett. Okay, so that is why I say stupidity is not a crime. Possibly this
30:17
a crime. Okay, so you are the ones who are standing with Bennett. Okay,
30:21
investors have said the margin is too less, it's useless. Okay, it's a bad
30:26
idea. Okay, if Bennett even if he sells the
30:31
holiday hope, how much is he going to get? 50,000. So where will he get the
30:36
remaining 490? It's almost $500,000 he requests.
30:39
Apply for a loan. Can can apply for a loan just because
30:42
his wife is a banker. Okay, he will get a loan. Huh? The bank will be the she
30:46
will be the first one to reject the application. Okay, possibly he might
30:50
have to take a debt as a loan. See, believe me, if he is going to not
30:56
like be successful. Leave alone like getting
31:00
divorced. He's going to go bankrupt. He's going to stay in jail. You want
31:05
Bennett to go to jail, huh? Then okay, you you want him to go to jail?
31:11
Gamble. Okay. Now tell me how many of you are
31:14
still a yes for Bennett after this? One to absolute idiots.
31:20
Okay. 1 2 three are three are still a yes for Bennett. Who's the fourth one
31:26
who got redeemed? Oh, you got redeemed. Okay, fine. Only three of these people
31:32
are there. Still, I will prove that you idiots are wrong. Okay, let's let us
31:38
still prove it. Okay. Now, this is the total cost, right? Suppose Bennett is
31:44
listening to these three people and Bennett is going to start the business.
31:48
He will make some money, right? He will also make some money. We have to look at
31:52
only not the cost part. We also have to look at the revenue part. Right? What is
31:56
the revenue Bennett is going to make? That is also given in the case. Wait.
32:02
Total revenue what Bennett might make. Listen.
32:09
Yes. Now what did San say if at all Bennett somehow takes a loan and makes
32:16
this particular product. Sanu said it will deliver this thing to Bennett at a
32:21
landing price, right? What was the landing price with San $263? It is
32:27
there. Okay, it is there in the case San like the landing price. Okay, the
32:32
landing price means Samuel, what is the meaning of landing price? Samuel will
32:37
make this and it will keep it in Bennett's doorstep for $263.
32:43
This is what is the landing price.
32:47
Sam you said now what did Bennett say? Bennett said that he needs at least how
32:52
much margin? 15%age margin. Right after 15%age margin
32:57
what is the amount of the microf 309 but do you know how this 309 came? 15%age
33:06
margin means you have to divide it by 85. This is basic math proportion
33:10
because 15%age or 85%age of 309 is 263 because 15%
33:17
margin you are taking it out. So are you able to get how this number 309 comes?
33:22
Anyone mathematically challenged here in the
33:26
class and not able to understand this got this part? How this 309 came? It is
33:31
also given in the case $39 after 15%age of margin Bennett wants. Yes. Can I take
33:39
this 300 instead of 309, can I take this as $38? Is this a big mistake to make?
33:45
Oh, $1 only, right? It's okay. $1 is not a big deal. Okay. Why am I taking this
33:51
as 308 instead of 263? Is because the difference here is a nice $45. That is
33:59
why I just do not want it to be $46. I want it to be $45. Is that a big
34:03
mistake? Not a big mistake, right? It's just a $1 change.
34:09
Let's say $1 Bennett gave it for charity. Okay. Now,
34:14
how will Bennett be able to take this micro fridge and take it to the
34:19
colleges? Tell me. Now, where are colleges present in like
34:24
a US? How many of you have been to the US or like visited? Where are colleges
34:29
usually present in the US? In the east coast.
34:32
Outs not east coast. In the outskirts in east coast it's away far away from human
34:38
civilization right those colleges are very big far away from where like and
34:43
when is this case happening what year is this case happening
34:46
1987 1987
34:49
okay so in 1987 okay far away from human civilization all these colleges are
34:56
present okay so how will Bennett be able to take this
35:02
microfit and give it to the colleges. Tell me how will Bennett be able to take
35:07
this microf and can he take the micro fridge on his head and say micro fridge
35:11
microf microf can he deliver it like that he needs retailers and distributors
35:16
right because he if he starts to drive it up how many colleges will he travel
35:22
at the same moment if he has to distribute he needs retailers and
35:25
distributors what is the retail and distributor margin
35:29
30%age it is there in the case right 30%age means how much will I divide this
35:34
5.70 it comes to $443
35:42
I can I'm going to just round it off to $450. This is the price of a microf
35:50
okay and for every microf how much is Bennett making
35:55
$45 just a 10%age profit. This is the reason why investors are against this
36:03
microf at all an investor I am an investor
36:09
boss. If I invested in the stock market I'll get a 15%age returns. Why will I
36:14
invest in your stupid idea which is just giving me 10%age returns. Many of the
36:18
times you also come right to me and say sir I want a seed money kind of a thing.
36:23
I ask what is the return that you're going to give me? If it is not even like
36:27
if you're not even going to beat the stock market, why should I trust in your
36:31
idea? You tell me this is the reason actual
36:35
reason why the investors investors are the masters of euphemism. They will say
36:39
something and they will mean something else. They are saying because this is
36:43
the reason. So he is not going to get a single rupee or a single pence or a
36:49
single pound or a single dollar or a single cent from any investor.
36:55
He's not going to get this money from any investor.
36:59
He has to take a loan only. How many of you are still a yes for
37:04
Bennett? One, two. Okay, you have dropped.
37:08
Wonderful. Okay. Now, let me still convince these two
37:14
that like it's a bad idea. How? Okay. Okay. Now if you look at it, suppose
37:19
Bennett is not going to listen to all of us and listen to these two fools. Okay.
37:24
And start this. Where are you going? Go 10 half an hour you are not able to
37:32
like sit. This is a really bad class. Go.
37:39
Now if you look at it, okay, if suppose Bennett has to start this business and
37:45
at least recover this $540,000, why? So that he can look at his wife,
37:51
smile and say, "Boss, I did it." Okay, at least to break even. How many
37:57
microfers should he sell? Right? If he has to recover this money back, okay,
38:04
and break even, what is the so-called break even volume?
38:10
Okay. At least he can save his marriage if he's recovering this $540,000 back.
38:15
Yes or no? This $540,000 divided by per microf how much is he
38:24
making? $45 only he's making per microf. How many microfides should Bennett sell?
38:31
12,000 microfides Bennett has to sell. Okay. 12,000 microfarges Bennett has to
38:37
sell. Is there a market for 12,000 microf where will he sell this microf?
38:44
The reason is the college and dorm administrator who should buy it. They
38:48
are saying no. 12,000 microf can he sell in motel owners? I'm not even sure. Do
38:55
you really think Bennett can sell this 12,000 microfides?
39:01
Okay. How many of you are still a yes for Bennett?
39:05
Huh? Why? What is the logic?
39:08
I think shouldn't write off like motel motel side. Still don't know.
39:13
So that is the thing. We do not even know that many motel are there. But
39:16
still see Bennett starting the business is easy. Yesterday I was saying but
39:21
sustaining the business is difficult. How many of you still a yes for Bennett
39:25
raise only these two people? Why entrepreneur
39:28
spirit? Okay that is crude. Okay. Now, are you people still yes for Bennett?
39:39
All the others, have you changed or like also anybody who's an for Bennett? No.
39:45
All of us are no for Bennett. Raise once more. I want to see all of you are no
39:50
for Bennett. Wonderful. Yes for Bennett is these two people. What about you? No.
39:56
Sitting on the fence. Okay. Yes. For Bennett or no for
39:59
Bennett? Yes. Oh, suddenly you changed.
40:02
Okay. Oh, getting support. Now let us say, okay, only these two
40:07
people I will not consider you. Okay. Only these two people are saying yes for
40:12
Bennett. See, they are like a minority. I have to support the minority. Right.
40:18
So, let me take an yes stance now. Okay. And let me see if I can convince all the
40:25
other idiots now. Okay. to like say whether I can say a yes for Bennett.
40:33
Okay, let us see if we can make a business. Majority has said no. Only
40:38
these two people are saying yes. But they also do not have any reason. They
40:40
have just said yes. Huh?
40:43
With retail distributors. See even then boss we do not know. Okay.
40:49
But retailer margin alone we know. We will work with this analysis. Right.
40:54
Okay. Now let us try to see. Okay, if I can convince you to say a yes for
41:00
Bennett. Okay, after a five minutes break. Okay, go come back.
41:10
Think about this and come back. I wrote an idea
41:23
uh for you told us. Should I keep it? a possible future.
41:27
That's okay. We will discuss. Okay. Okay.
41:31
It's my my writing. That's okay.
41:34
That's okay. Yeah. We'll discuss after the class.
41:37
Okay. So, in this you would have to sell 6.6
41:42
every day to break even at 5 years. We'll see. No sit.
41:48
What households also buy this? Households won't buy it. Why? Because
41:54
they will buy a micro. They ask this question, I'll tell you.
41:59
Yes. Go on. Come back quickly.
42:20
You see, we'll see. Okay. Huh?
42:23
Yes. Right. there. I do not know. We'll see.
42:32
I didn't pitch. I just present them because the founder was I'm not an
42:37
expert in AI stuff. Yeah. But he gets so nervous and we make
42:42
we need to make some adjustments. He needs to
42:46
Yeah. But it was good. I thought that it was good. And what was the investor
42:50
saying that we need to refocus
42:55
already the customers? Um literally when the investor was talking
43:02
I I felt that he was you literally okay how old are you?
43:06
Uh 19 what? Almost 20. Okay. The other founder
43:12
I don't know 40. Oh 40.
43:15
Yeah. And I have an idea now. I don't It's from scratch. It's an idea.
43:23
I don't know. For example, you see the stock market.
43:27
All companies are in the stock market and all of that. So
43:33
what's happening a lot of countries from the US market like India,
43:39
China, you know, all these countries and how much population is in this you know
43:44
countries at at least What will happen if we can pass of if in
43:51
the tomorrow the company says oh go to stock market go to the crypto market try
43:57
to replicate an index but now in crypto where everybody can have access
44:03
okay this is my idea
44:05
we we will talk about we we'll talk about
44:08
because I would like to pitch that we'll talk
44:10
yeah I'm
44:14
trading. So yeah, actually I started trading when
44:18
I was 15. So I
44:22
Okay, good. So how much returns are you making?
44:25
How much money? How much yearly annual returns are you
44:28
making? Okay. So I was
44:33
Okay. So the stock market has an algorithm. algorithm change in
44:39
certain in certain time. So I was managing 600 yeah 600k.
44:46
Okay. At the beginning of the year now I only
44:49
managing 20 something because I used to be a swing trader. Okay.
44:56
I remember I set up a trad. Okay. Okay. Okay.
45:06
Then Friday night deep appears and then the stock market opens with a huge gap
45:11
here and loss of Okay. We will we will sit and talk.
45:16
We'll talk. We'll talk. Okay. We'll talk. Okay. Don't worry.
45:19
Okay. Don't worry.
45:38
One minute. One minute.
46:00
Yes. Tell me. now. Okay.
46:10
It's not I don't have that much data with me
46:15
because they just like compile the idea that I have. So I don't have like all
46:18
the data in terms of how much investment I want who I want to target because I
46:22
don't even know how that works. How is that uh different? Who are the
46:30
competitors? That is one slide that you have to put. How are you different from
46:33
the competitors in term? Okay. So, quick question. I
46:36
have to put that in terms of the brand. This particular brand
46:41
especially in a 2x2 if you're able to show how you're different then
46:55
competition in this particular think about it. Somebody might be there.
47:03
That's okay. I don't know.
47:12
Don't bother. We will learn that. Go. There's no need. If you're not there,
47:19
you can put some tam sam but like you should be able to defend that.
47:23
I don't know what that is. So then like don't bother. If you do not
47:26
know something, don't put I mean they'll help me make sure
47:31
yes in this entire course that's what you're going to learn but the only thing
47:35
is that I have I'll take 30 30 hours to make you learn that is the thing you'll
47:40
learn don't worry go sit yeah one minute
47:59
Yes, tell me. Uh, we're sending in drop shipping
48:03
business for the pitching thing. Uh, we have free revenue right now. We have a
48:07
unique promise and all the other slides. If they will obviously ask us why do you
48:11
need the money for the obvious answer is marketing budget. What else do we add?
48:15
How do we legitimate our ask? We will talk. Okay. Uh,
48:21
submit in one to two hours. The thing is that like you have to say
48:26
that like where are you planning to take the business forward then like you'll be
48:30
able to not only that what will be the future road map in 2 years 3 years what
48:36
will you be able to give it to them projection
48:40
go sit no bro sit sit sit sit situ are you basically from Canada
48:47
go sit sit sit sit sit wait let me go
48:53
yes boss Huh? Tell me. Huh?
48:56
That's okay. No, it's okay. She's unwell. It's fine.
49:01
You're not well. Then what are you sitting it for? Use
49:04
that fellow. Keep the leg down. Okay, listen. Shh. What are you all
49:12
doing? Ching the case. Even then it will say wrong
49:18
only. Okay. Now let us try to convince the other people who said no. No, no,
49:23
no, no, no. For Bennett to say yes. Okay,
49:26
because I am with you. And where is that other guy?
49:30
Yes. Oh, he's there. Okay, so ah, quick, quick, quick. Get in.
49:36

49:41
Put the shirt. Shirt on. Oh, yes. Okay. Hey, juice and fruit is not
49:49
allowed. I'll tell I'll tell you folks.
49:53
See the thing no the thing is that like no beverages are allowed inside please
49:59
don't make this mistake okay please don't make this mistake because it is I
50:04
am okay with it but amiti is not okay you idiots like what you did was
50:09
yesterday many people ate everything and put all the rappers here and went
50:14
that when they are giving a right use that well
50:19
okay that is the problem okay please don't allow any of this coffees and
50:23
inside the class bring it drink it and come or like put it in the bag and come.
50:28
Okay. So that is a thing. Yes. Now
50:42
tell me sh when you're going to a political leader's office who's the most
50:49
powerful person in a political leader office boss.
50:53
Huh? Who's the most powerful person in a
50:58
political leader office? Who's the most powerful person in any
51:03
leader's office? Not just the president's office.
51:07
No the president. No
51:09
president and all does not have any power.
51:12
Who's the most powerful? Whenever you're going to any political persons, huh?
51:17
People never have power. I'll tell you who is the one.
51:21
The richest one. The pug.
51:28
The pun. Okay. Or the security guard.
51:33
Why? Let Yes. No. The security guard is the
51:38
one who should let you in. He is the gatekeeper. The leader might
51:43
be watching a movie inside. Okay. But you say, "Ah, sir is super busy." Tada.
51:48
Okay. He can close the door. Yes or no?
51:53
Only if the security guard wills, you'll be even able to get into the hotel.
51:58
That's it. Okay. Are you able to get it? Only if the security guard will, you'll
52:03
be even able to get into the hotel. Right.
52:07
Now who the security guard is the
52:11
gatekeeper? The security guard is the gatekeeper. Now who is the gatekeeper in
52:16
our case? Who is the person? Huh? Oh, the college people.
52:20
No, the college administrator. The No, no, no, no. Boss, it's the DOM ad who is
52:24
the one who stopping the microfits from entering into the college?
52:28
The dom administrator. It's not the college administrator. Why is the DOM
52:32
administrator not allowing this microfing inside?
52:38
No. See, then they should be allowing it, right? Yes.
52:44
Thank you so much. Love you for that. Okay. What? What did he say? Okay. They
52:50
do not want the students to move out of the meal plan.
52:55
Okay. Now see college food is universally bad. Hostile food is
53:02
universally bad. That is why it is called as the mess. Okay. I don't think
53:06
many of you got the joke but fine I know. Okay. So but listen it is very bad
53:12
but people do you really think if there is a hostel food available you will sign
53:16
out of it? No. Why? Because you might crib and cry
53:20
about the food but you will always be with the food. Why? Because it is the go
53:24
to food. Anytime you can have that food. Yes or no? Now moreover, when is this
53:31
case happening? Boss, this case happening in 87. So was there
53:35
a Karim or a Uber Eats or like a Talabat at that time?
53:39
No. Right. So the students are not going to go out of the meal plan. But first
53:44
let us say if the students are going to be in the meal plan. Let us say that.
53:48
Okay. If at all the students are going to be in the meal plan, what is the
53:52
money the dom administrator is making? Suppose in the meal plan tell me 1987 on
54:00
an average what will be the meal plan cost? What do you think is the meal plan
54:04
cost per month? Most 1987
54:09
okay how many dollars monthly I'm talking about monthly
54:15
I will say $200. Okay, 50 maximum it'll be $100 only but like we will still take
54:22
$200. Okay, we'll still take $200. Why there are 30 days? Because whenever we
54:28
are going to present a worst case scenario, we have to always take
54:31
whenever we are going to present a case to someone who is not getting convinced,
54:35
we have to present the worst case scenario and say that you are going to
54:38
be benefited in it. Yes. So let us say the college students are paying almost
54:46
$200. Okay. Now where is this $200? I I will say instead of $200 I'll take it as
54:51
$210. Okay. Why? Because there are 30 days in a month. Let us say the student
54:58
is paying $7. It comes to $210. Yes or no? Logically. And it is okay amount of
55:06
money. It will be$1 $100 only. But I'm still taking $200. Okay.
55:11
Now from here onwards it is my assumptions and you can play with your
55:16
own assumptions. Okay. Now let us say that the college
55:20
administration or the dom administrator is making a 10%age profit on this. Okay.
55:26
Why? Why a 10%age profit? Because they will have to hire people to cook the
55:33
food. They have to buy the groceries, materials and everything, right?
55:36
Electricity cost, rental cost and other stuff. 10 percentage is a good margin.
55:40
Even you can take 20%age margin. Even you can take 20%age and play with this
55:45
numbers. Okay? This is completely up to you. Okay? So 10%age profit means how
55:50
much are they going to make? $21. Yes or no? Are you with me here? Are you
55:58
with me here? Now even though the college is going to how many months in a
56:03
year the students are going to be in the college bus
56:07
say 8 months usually 8 9 months but like let
56:10
us say 10 months okay why because anyways two months they are going to
56:14
like go out for their summer and winter vacation but when we are arguing let us
56:21
argue with the worst case scenario let us say the students is paying for all
56:24
the 12 months okay how much money is are they going to pay
56:29
into 12 it comes to how much $252
56:35
or close to $250 this This is the money that the DOM
56:39
administrator thinks that they will lose.
56:43
This is the reason why the DOM administrators are completely against
56:46
this particular product from entering inside.
56:50
That's the logic. So whenever you are seeing a stakeholder is not allowing
56:54
your idea, you have to understand why is the stakeholder not doing it?
56:58
Because this for the dom administrator, this is a business issue. This is a
57:02
business problem. He is making $250 from a student. Now, if the student is going
57:06
to go out of the meal plan, he's going to lose $250, right? Why the hell should
57:10
he allow a microfilch? This is why he he stopping the microfits from entering.
57:17
Now, if you can show to this DOM administrator that like he will actually
57:21
make a lot more money, okay, will he allow this microf or not? If the
57:27
student drops out, he will logically he will allow. Now let us say if the
57:32
students is going to drop out suppose in a no meal plan
57:39
where will the students go and eat? Will they be able to cook?
57:47
Will can you cook in this microf? Can you cook in this microf? No, you
57:52
cannot cook in this microf. You look at this microf this micro fridge is not a
57:56
refrigerator. It is not a microwave oven. It will not function like both.
58:01
See you you see like in a refrigerator you can store things worth 10 15 days at
58:05
least. And in a microwave oven what can you do? You can cook different things
58:10
right? In the stupid micro fridge what you can do is you cannot like
58:16
you cannot store things. Okay you cannot store things. Why can't you store
58:19
things? Because if you look at the entire it's so small. Okay. Maximum you
58:24
can store two three pizza boxes, one can of beer. Okay. And possibly a bag of
58:29
apples. That's all. And can you cook in the microwave? You
58:34
cannot. You can just heat the food and eat it. That is exactly boss, keep the
58:38
phone away. Keep the phone away. Listen, you can just heat the food and eat it.
58:43
That is what they were also doing in the hot plate also. They were not cooking.
58:46
Actually, they were actually heating and eating. Now, where will they go and buy
58:50
this pizzas and the burgers? Where will they go and buy the pizzas and burgers?
58:55
Fast food. Fast first. Where are the host present?
58:59
away from human civilization. Okay. And 1987, do you have like any
59:05
fast food restaurants there? Where will the students go and buy the
59:10
pizza boxes and burger boxes? Okay. So, they will drive every day 50
59:15
miles and buy the pizza boxes three times a day.
59:19
So, they will buy only from the dom administrator because he has the pantry.
59:25
Only he has the pantry. They can buy only from the dom administrators. Right
59:30
now, every day the students should eat how many times?
59:33
Three times. Because they're 17 year olds like you. 17 18 year olds like you.
59:37
They have to eat at least three times, right? Yes or no?
59:41
Sorry. Okay. So, three times a day. Okay. So, let us say the DOM
59:49
administrator is making just 50 cents of profit per meal. And these are packaged
59:54
boxes. So you can actually charge a higher profit. Let us say he is making
59:59
50 cents. How many days are the students going to eat? Even though here we have
1:00:04
taken 12 months. Okay, here we will take only 300 days that they are staying. So
1:00:09
three because the worst case scenario, right? 300 days. Every day how much?
1:00:13
$1.5 because three 50 cents 50 cents 50 cents $1.5. How much does this come to?
1:00:20
$450. Now what is the rental fees of the
1:00:23
microf students are willing to pay another $50.
1:00:31
How much will the dom administrator make now?
1:00:35
$500. Are you able to get this number? How did
1:00:39
this number come from? Yes. No. Are you with me? If the student
1:00:45
is in the meal plan, how much will they make?
1:00:49
$250. If the student is going out of the meal plan, how much are they going to
1:00:53
make? $500. I am saying that the students will
1:00:56
not go out of the meal plan. Why? Because students don't want to cook.
1:01:00
Okay, this is additional money only going to come. But if still the guy
1:01:03
argues that like a boss students are going to go out of the meal plan, then
1:01:07
what you do? You present the worst case scenario. Even if they are going to go
1:01:10
out of the meal plan, you're going to make money extra. Yes or no? Are you
1:01:15
able to get this? Are are you It's too much heavy. Are you able to get it? Yes.
1:01:20
Why is the rental fee on there? No, the students said they will pay 50
1:01:24
fees. $50, right? Going to run the administration only,
1:01:28
right? So that's extra $50. How does money go into pocket from that?
1:01:34
Bennett, this is not okay. Bennett will get this $450 and walk.
1:01:41
Yes. When this when when they are buying. Now let us say what is the
1:01:45
additional money this DOM administrator is making
1:01:49
250 500 minus 250 that is $250 extra they are making right per year yes or
1:01:55
no. Now what is the price of a microfil? $450.
1:02:02
If they're going to buy this microfil in how many months can they recover this
1:02:06
money divided by $250 you'll come to how many years? 1.8 8
1:02:12
years. How many years did Bennett say this microf is going to last? Seven
1:02:17
years. How many years did they say that it'll last?
1:02:20
3 years. Is this less than 3 years? If you show this to them, will they
1:02:30
accept the microf or not? If they if you you have showed this
1:02:36
calculation, then will they accept the microf or not?
1:02:39
Yes. Right. Logically, because they make more money. Why will they say no to a
1:02:42
microfilch? Now let's come to Mr. Patel. Who's Mr. Patel?
1:02:50
He is the owner of the motel. Okay. Why? Because most of the motel in the US are
1:02:56
owned by Patails from India. Okay. Now where are motel present? Tell me.
1:03:02
In series. Huh?
1:03:03
In cities. In
1:03:05
cities. Useless. Okay. Cities. Okay. How much TV are you watching? Where are
1:03:11
motives present on the cities
1:03:14
cities not in cities okay they are again away from human civilization you are
1:03:20
talking about hotels boss I'm talking about motel motel are present in the
1:03:24
highways right now let us say Mr. Patel is opening keeping the motel open for
1:03:31
300 days at least 60 days he taking Sunday break okay 300 days he's keeping
1:03:37
the motel open and motel usually have a very less occupancy rate how much hardly
1:03:45
20 30%age are 30 35% we will take even less 20%age is the occupancy
1:03:58
So how many days it is occupied? 60 days because 20%age of 300 is 60 days. Yes or
1:04:06
no? Per day, how much the motel owner uh motel guest said that they will pay
1:04:10
extra? $3.
1:04:13
So how much money will Mr. Patel make in a year? $180.
1:04:19
Right now what is the price of one microf
1:04:26
Mr. Patel recover this money? 2.4 years. Is this also less than the
1:04:32
3-ear period? If Mr. Bennett was astute enough, he
1:04:39
could have just sold it to the motel owners and he could have recovered this
1:04:44
12,000 and microfar money. Okay, he could have made this particular break
1:04:49
even if Bennett was because every motel may there will be like at least 10 15
1:04:55
rooms, right? So if he if Bennett was astute enough, he could have done it
1:05:00
here. How many of you are still a no for
1:05:04
Bennett was after all this calculation also? I do not believe because there's
1:05:08
so much of assumption there. How many of you are still a no for Bennett?
1:05:12
Okay, I've showed a business case for Bennett. Still, how many of you are not
1:05:16
convinced? No boss, I am a no for Beneter.
1:05:20
Okay. Bennett did not listen to all of you. Okay. He did not listen to the wife
1:05:26
also. Very bad mistake. Bennett did not listen to any one of these people or to
1:05:31
the wife. Okay. And he went ahead and launched Microf.
1:05:37
Okay. In 1987, Bennett started this business. In 1988, Bennett launched
1:05:43
Microf. In two in 1998,
1:05:51
he sold Microf to Gray Appliances for $400 million.
1:06:01
Okay. Which was then resold to Dan B for $2 billion.
1:06:08
Okay. In 2000. Okay. But Benner did not have it easy. Listen
1:06:13
all of you. Benner did not have it easy. See 1988 he launched this business.
1:06:19
Right. For 6 months. Not a single microfit sold. Not not a
1:06:27
not one micro fridge also sold for 6 months.
1:06:30
Sano the manufacturer they also got jittery. They were seeing that Bennett
1:06:34
was going bankrupt and San said buff you take the micro fridges away. You pay up
1:06:39
front. Listen, then you can take a picture.
1:06:42
Listen. Bennett was at his wit's end because it
1:06:49
was a great product. He went and showed all of this calculation to the hostile
1:06:54
administrators and the DOM administrators. Okay? They said screw
1:06:57
you, okay? Like we are not going to like buy this micro switch from you.
1:07:03
Then one Bennett realized he has forgotten a very important
1:07:09
stakeholder. Who is the person who is extremely
1:07:15
bothered about the child's safety? Parents
1:07:21
okay Bennett forgot that like he has like I also deliberately left the
1:07:26
parents out. Okay. Now what did Bennett do? Bennett actually wrote to the
1:07:31
parents of these kids. Okay. What did they say? Boss, I have an
1:07:38
excellent product which will keep your kids safety safe from dom fires but the
1:07:44
college administration is not willing to buy it.
1:07:48
Do you want to take it? Then the parents wrote back to the
1:07:52
college if you are not going to buy this micro fridge and put it in our ws
1:07:57
dormatories then we will then the college administration got
1:08:02
ashamed and said no no no you don't buy it we will buy it
1:08:07
okay and the rest is history so sometimes who
1:08:13
problem you are solving okay might be hidden
1:08:18
sometimes the stakeholders might be a hidden stakeholder actually is the micro
1:08:23
fridge a microwave oven? No. Is it a refrigerator? No, it will not function
1:08:29
like both. What was the problem the microf was solving?
1:08:34
Safety of the kids. Okay. In a where like there is bad electric wiring and a
1:08:40
constrained space only in that place microf will be useful. Do you really
1:08:46
think a family of two will buy this microf? No. They will buy a refrigerator
1:08:51
separately and a microwave oven separately. If you can set up a kitchen,
1:08:55
a guy with a 1 BHK also will not buy this microf. He will buy a microwave
1:09:00
separately and a refrigerator separately. This will be purchased only
1:09:04
by individuals who have safety issues because of bad electric wiring and
1:09:08
there's a constraint space. Okay, which can be sold only in the
1:09:14
collegees and in the motel. Now if you look at the motel and the colleges,
1:09:19
okay, in the colleges, the student safety is in peril, right? Who is the
1:09:24
one who's most bothered about the student safety? The parents only.
1:09:28
Students don't care. They want to burn the place down only. Okay, given a
1:09:32
chance, you will also burn this hostel. But college dom administrator doesn't
1:09:40
care. He's looking at $250 is going away from me. The parents are the ones
1:09:44
bothered. Okay, suppose I call your parent and say was your daughter's life
1:09:48
is in peril. Next flight may they will be coming here and give one slap to me
1:09:52
and say are you able to get it? Okay, because your safety is very very very
1:09:56
important for your parents are you able to get it? And that is the stakeholder
1:10:01
Bennett tabbed on to okay still how many of you think sit properly. Okay, moving
1:10:08
moving moving. I am the second time I am feeling bad that I'm going to bump on
1:10:11
you. Okay. Now tell me logically tell me how many of you still
1:10:19
think was all this explanation is right but Bennett is still lucky. How many of
1:10:24
you think Bennett was still lucky? Many things could have gone wrong for
1:10:27
Bennett. One two of course. Why? Why do you think Bennett is lucky? What could
1:10:32
have gone wrong? About 67 micro.
1:10:39
Not necessarily boss. Okay. That is what your assumption is. Suppose he's going
1:10:43
to a college. In this Amiti college, there are 6,000 students. He could have
1:10:47
like put even there are 3,000 rooms. He could have sold 3,000 microfides in one
1:10:52
college. Even if he cracks five colleges, five deals made would have
1:10:55
been done. That's where you get missing.
1:11:00
Yes. Why do you think Bennett is still lucky? Yes, boss.
1:11:03
Because well, the argument is parents the most important thing is their kids
1:11:09
health and safety. Safety. Yes,
1:11:11
but until nowadays like microwave is still so dangerous for people like all
1:11:17
the microplastics it contains. Oh boss, that is okay. That this is
1:11:21
like the parents they need to know that. No, no,
1:11:24
it's a fact. Yo, boss, this is 1987. Nobody knew
1:11:29
about microplastics and stuff. Okay, listen to the case in 1987. Don't come
1:11:33
to 200 25. You get it? You But there is another problem in the case. What? Why
1:11:39
do you think Benedict is lucky? Yes, boss.
1:11:41
Wife didn't divorce him. Sir Jesus, why do you want toxic boy?
1:11:45
Okay. Why do you wife will like wife is happy with him? Okay. That is not the
1:11:50
problem. There is one problem. Why was Bened? Yes.
1:11:55
Thank you so much. Okay. I give a applause for him. Okay. So, a competitor
1:12:02
could have come in. Leave alone a big competitor. Even a small competitor
1:12:06
could have come in. Right? Why did the competition not come?
1:12:12
Okay. Huh? Small market.
1:12:14
Why did the competition? Yes. Is ridiculous.
1:12:17
See, I completely agree with you. It's See, possibly in 1988 when Bennett was
1:12:24
struggling, everybody might have thought it is ridiculous. But the moment
1:12:27
somebody is making money, will you keep quiet? Suppose Tetar when the idea is
1:12:32
being started, everybody mocked. Okay, of course this is a ridiculous
1:12:37
idea. Okay, seven um uh semesters in seven countries is like a ridiculous
1:12:43
idea. But today at least 10 different schools are thinking about starting
1:12:47
this. The moment money starts to come in, competition will come in, right? So
1:12:51
in 1988 possibly people thought it was ridiculous. But in 1990 when B when it
1:12:56
was starting to do well, people should have come in right. Why did the
1:12:58
competition not come? Huh?
1:13:01
What about low margin? Okay. Yes. the switch that you had.
1:13:06
No, there was no patent. The there was a question of a patent. The patent did not
1:13:09
come. Ah, that is okay. But like still people
1:13:13
could have come in, right? Okay. So, this is where Okay. Who said he said
1:13:19
right a small market? Now, if you look at do you really think a family of two
1:13:24
will buy this microf? Wake up all of you. Do you really think
1:13:27
a family of two will buy this microf? No. Okay. A a guy with a big house will
1:13:35
he buy a microfilch? No. So this is a very small market because it solved a
1:13:41
very unique problem. Okay. What is that particular problem? Safety in a bad with
1:13:48
bad electric wiring in a constrained space. Right? That is the only problem
1:13:52
it was solving. Suppose see the microfit was like this. It had a very very small
1:13:57
market. Now, Bennett somehow, this is where I'll call Bennett lucky.
1:14:02
Bennett somehow stumbled on this particular problem. Bennett somehow
1:14:06
stumbled on this particular problem and he went and occupied this much amount of
1:14:11
the market and he broke even quickly. Okay. Now, this unique this unique it's
1:14:18
a unique problem with a unique solution that is what is called as a niche
1:14:22
market. This type of a market is what is called as a niche market where there was
1:14:28
a unique problem and a unique solution. Why? Nobody else will buy this microfil.
1:14:33
A family of two will not buy this microf. They will buy a microwave oven
1:14:36
and a refrigerator separately are able to get it now. Bennett somehow
1:14:42
went into this market. Now let us say what's your name?
1:14:45
Huh? Mahan.
1:14:47
Mahan. Mahan.
1:14:48
Okay. I'm very difficult to pronounce. Amanda.
1:14:51
Amanda. Okay. Now Amanda wants to come into this market. Amanda wants to come
1:14:56
into this market. Listen while they'll come. Amanda is now coming into this
1:15:00
market. Okay. Now Amanda is the enemy. Bennett is seeing enemies at the gates.
1:15:07
Okay. Now how much money will Amanda require to start this business?
1:15:13
Again, Amanda also require same $540,000.
1:15:16
Yes or no? But what did Bennett do? Bennett went
1:15:20
into the market and 6 months he broke even. 6 months he sold this business.
1:15:24
Okay. Or sold the um uh microf. Now if Amanda is going to come in, Amanda is
1:15:31
going to come in. Bennett is going to go and tell Amanda you want to come in?
1:15:35
Welcome. But I have made my money. Now I do not
1:15:41
want $45 from a microf. I just need $30 because I want my
1:15:48
customer I'm going to be a good guy to my customers. I just need $30.
1:15:53
Now, how many microfes should Amanda sell to break even? Now,
1:15:59
tell me, if he has reduced the price by $15 to only the $30 profit, how much
1:16:05
should she sell? 18,000 microfides to break even. Yes,
1:16:13
Bennett can still play dirty. And he says, "Boss, I need only $10 from a
1:16:16
microf like should Amanda sell now $54,000.
1:16:24
Bennett can still play dirty and go till $1. Is there a market for 54,000 and a
1:16:30
microfides when there are like two players fighting?"
1:16:33
This is what Bennett would have done. Bennett would have come and made sure
1:16:38
Amanda bleed to death as a new player. That's what like she he will do. This is
1:16:44
what is called as a credible threat strategy. This is what is called as a
1:16:50
credible threat or a credible deterrence strategy.
1:17:00
Why was Bennett able to provide a credible threat or a credible deterrence
1:17:04
strategy? You come in, I will kill you by like reducing the price. This is what
1:17:09
is a credible threat. Why was Bennett able to do this?
1:17:14
So what was that advantage called as? He had something called as a first mover
1:17:20
advantage. What did you say? No, he had not a monopoly. He had a
1:17:25
first mover advantage. Bennett had a first mover advantage. Listen, a fast
1:17:31
mover advantage in a
1:17:39
niche market alone can provide a credible return strategy. In a large
1:17:43
market, first more advantage will not provide a credible return strategy. For
1:17:46
example, if tomorrow tet new school is coming, okay, will Pratam reduce the
1:17:52
fees of TAR? No. Why? Why will this credible
1:17:56
deterrence not work there? is already established.
1:17:59
No, Bennett also was very established. But
1:18:02
why did he agree to reduce the price? Why was he planning that? Because the
1:18:06
market was niche. But in Tetar's case, the market is a huge market. There are
1:18:12
thousands and thousands of students. That is why even if Pratam reduces the
1:18:16
fees or does not reduce the fees, new players will automatically come. So then
1:18:21
like do you not have a first advantage in a large market? Don't you have a
1:18:24
first advantage in a large market? Yes, you have a first mover advantage in
1:18:29
a large market but that is not credible deterrence. What is that? Suppose when
1:18:34
you're coming to India there is one cab service called as rapido. Rapido is a
1:18:41
cab service. Now suppose like you are booking rapido service and the cab is
1:18:46
coming possibly a grandfather will come and say boss your Uber has come. Why?
1:18:53
Because even though a new player comes in, you know the large player in a in a
1:18:58
large market or the first mover in a large market gets a brand presence or a
1:19:03
brand credibility. So first mover advantage comes in multiple formats.
1:19:07
Okay. In a niche market it has a credible deterrent
1:19:13
strategy. In a large market it has a brand presence strategy. Happens right
1:19:18
in the US also today. Even though it is other cap service they will simply say
1:19:22
boss Uber has come. Why? Uber has the first mover. So it has that brand
1:19:27
presence. So first more advantage can come in like a different formats. In a
1:19:33
niche market it will come as a credible threat. In a large market it will come
1:19:38
as a what? Brand presence. Yes. Yes or no? Now still there is one
1:19:49
question his question what was the question? Oh, I was saying if these like
1:19:54
these credible threats are they just normally threats because let's say like
1:19:57
the other person is crazy enough. Exactly. What if what if we talked about
1:20:04
Amanda Kame is a small player with $500,000
1:20:08
but what is he saying? A large player could have come in, right? A Samsung
1:20:14
could have come in with their own microf itself could have come in with their own
1:20:19
microf. No. Huh?
1:20:32
But why did a large player not come? They could have come, right? They could
1:20:36
have come. Yes. Thank you so much. Okay. What is what
1:20:41
did you the same thing? Because the market was small. Okay. Boss, what is
1:20:47
the meaning of it? Boss, Samsung and Sano, they are like elephants in a
1:20:52
forest. One elephant will fight with another
1:20:57
elephant. Who was Bennett? Bennett was like a
1:21:01
rabbit running here and there, okay? Trying to eat the scraps.
1:21:06
Bacha is a kid, okay? And there are like multiple another kid now like let him do
1:21:12
the dirty job of like trying to create the market. The moment he grows I will
1:21:20
he moving from a rat or a rabbit size to a deer size I will go and gobble him up
1:21:26
and that is exactly what happened. Okay. It is easy to acquire a sen player by a
1:21:34
large player. So whenever you are coming up with an idea don't think that like
1:21:38
your idea should be always all about like becoming a unicorn or a decacon. No
1:21:45
the first thing whenever like you are going to look at this bus I have an idea
1:21:50
how can I take an exit for this idea even if it is say $40 $50 million and if
1:21:57
you're saying that like I'm going to make like some $100 million and I'm
1:22:01
going to sell it off to a big player that is also a good idea. Always
1:22:06
you have this stupid notion that like okay most was like I have to come up
1:22:10
with an idea the idea should be large enough I want to become a unicorn. No
1:22:15
no that is not what it is. If you are able to come up with an idea and if
1:22:19
you're able to sell this idea off properly
1:22:23
that is also an excellent strategy you'll make a lot of money. That is
1:22:29
exactly what Bennett did. The market was too small. But if you
1:22:36
look at it, Samsung or Sano, they fight a different game boss. Okay. If at all
1:22:42
Samsung is going to come into this market, Samsung produces in millions of
1:22:46
units and they will use advertisement to sell, right? One advertisement itself
1:22:51
will be $5,000. Okay? One week or three, four days they
1:22:56
will spend $500,000. $500,000 is not a big amount of money for a Samsung or a
1:23:00
San. But how would how do you think Bennett would have advertised microf
1:23:08
campuses and he would have given some pamphlets. Oh boss, please look at this.
1:23:13
And microf is like ragging or hazing. It would have been passed from the senior
1:23:18
to junior. Everybody knows about it but nobody has seen it an advertisement of
1:23:23
it. Okay. So it would have just moved from one batch to another batch.
1:23:30
Samsung and Sanu do not play this small game. And that is why whenever you come
1:23:36
up with an idea, if you're going to go and attack a niche space, big players
1:23:42
will not come and attack you. And if you're able to come up with
1:23:46
something quick where you can have a small first more advantage, okay, you
1:23:52
will be easily able to start a business. That is the first thing that you have to
1:23:57
do. The moment you have come up with an idea, who are your stakeholders?
1:24:02
Who are your stakeholders? The moment you come up with an idea, who are your
1:24:07
stakeholders? Now, this is the next thing that we are going to see. Now, if
1:24:10
you look at the different stakeholders, whose wife? wife and Bennett is the
1:24:15
company. College administration, college
1:24:20
students, okay, motel owners, motel guests, okay, parents are the consumers
1:24:27
or the customers. The manufacturer, investors, retailers,
1:24:32
they are the collaborators. the National Fire Protection Agency and
1:24:40
the government is the context and of course there is the competition
1:24:46
as well. Now these are the five stakeholders who
1:24:53
can come and make or break your business. That is the next step. The
1:24:57
moment you have an idea, you will also look at who are all the different
1:25:02
stakeholders who can make take my help me take my idea forward.
1:25:07
That is the next step which we will start from next class. This is the last
1:25:13
time I'm saying okay if you are not going to take good rest and come here
1:25:18
then it is going to be a problem. Every day the boy comes and sleeps here. Okay.
1:25:22
I do not even know what is his problem. I don't think his circadian rhythm has
1:25:27
not like come to a proper circle. It's okay. Let him sleep. Every day I think
1:25:31
he even if he sleeps in the class evening fully he's going to party.
1:25:36
That's what he's doing. Yes.
1:25:44
When to exit the market because maybe like new technology could come out and
1:25:48
just the three sessions are done. Why do you want all the answers in day three?
1:25:51
Okay. We will talk about that in the subsequent sessions. Okay. But are you
1:25:55
able to get this? Yeah.
1:25:57
Okay. I expect the same kind of analysis for all the other cases.
1:26:02
Next class onwards. If you do not prepare and come, I will throw you out.
1:26:07
Go. Please don't follow this rule. Okay, we
1:26:20
are then like they will throw us out of like a only then we do not have a
1:26:23
college.

How do you create an ideal consumer persona?
01/10/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Dr. Bhupesh Manoharan
0:00
Any questions? Huh? Careful. Careful. I think they are
0:07
like Did you come by the first bus or the second bus?
0:12
Okay. Wonderful. That's a different answer.
0:21
What happened? Everybody was partying yesterday night or the bus has not come
0:26
yet. Okay.
0:48
Any questions? Please keep your phones away. Today, let's have an interesting
0:53
class today because I'm going to start with segmentation. Okay.
1:01
I think some of the folks are coming. This class.
1:09
Which class? This class. Get it. Okay, great. Settle down.
1:38
Any questions from yesterday? Did you even go and look at like what we
1:44
discussed yesterday? I don't think so. Okay. Did you then how can you people
1:51
blindedly lie in the morning itself? So how many classes do you people have
1:55
today? Three classes.
1:57
Three classes. Oh then like you have your student elections who are all
2:00
contesting for the elections here in this class. You for what post?
2:04
Huh? Treasurer
2:07
for president. Okay. Oh, you're contesting contesting for president. How
2:11
many of you are going to vote for her? motivation.
2:19
Just in time. Are people coming?
2:26
Your boss, how did you come? You came in the bus.
2:29
Cab. Okay. Should we keep the door open for a
2:34
minute or so? Or like closer? No attendance for that. Okay. Great.
2:45
Folks listen. So what have we done today? What have
2:50
what have we done so far? And what are we going to do today? Okay.
2:56
So today we we will start with segmentation. Okay. But before that like
3:00
we want to finish the feasibility and the capability checks. Okay. So let us
3:05
try to do a recap. Finish the feasibility and capability check and
3:09
we'll start with segmentation. Okay. for tomorrow's class. Tomorrow we have a
3:13
class with you people or day after tomorrow. When are you going to UE?
3:20
This week you are not going to Oh, Monday. Okay, cool. Then like uh I'll be
3:24
meeting you tomorrow as well. Okay. And after tomorrow as well.
3:34
Sorry. No, it's okay.
3:43
So you open the door for him. Settle down
3:57
my phone. Let us make Okay, great. So, listen. So, what have
4:11
we done so far? What have we done so far? Because you are not revising. Let
4:15
me recap. We said that the objective of this
4:20
particular course is all about like trying to come up with an idea and take
4:24
it to the market and make money out of it, right? So how do you come up with an
4:29
idea? We said that like you do the need gap analysis. Okay. The out the outcome
4:34
of a need gap analysis is what is your idea, right? The outcome of a need gap
4:39
analysis is what is your idea? And when we say idea, what is it? It's a problem
4:47
coupled with a solution. Yes. Now you have an idea. Can you go to the market
4:53
with the idea? No. Right. You have to check whether it is a profitable one.
4:59
Okay, you have to check whether it is an understandable one, whether it is a
5:02
feasible one and whether you are capable of executing this idea or what is the
5:06
meaning of it. You have an idea, you have to check whether it is a viable
5:11
idea to pursue. If it is not viable, okay, then it'll come as an idea and
5:17
it'll die as an idea. Okay. So, in many cases that is exactly sometimes we say
5:23
this. Yes, of course your idea is a ba your baby. Okay, but sometimes it will
5:29
be an ugly baby. Okay, so you have to throw it out of the window. Okay, you
5:33
cannot just keep it like forever. Okay, otherwise you will be pursuing something
5:38
that is futile. Okay. So that is where we went and checked whether this idea is
5:46
a profitable one, whether it is an understandable one
5:57
and of course we have to check whether it is a feasible idea and you are
6:01
capable of executing this idea. Now how do we do this? We said that like we will
6:06
do this using something called as the stakeholder analysis. Okay. Or the 5C
6:12
analysis, right? We'll do this by doing the stakeholder analysis. It's also
6:17
called as the 5C analysis or it is also called as the market scanning analysis,
6:26
right? And who are all the different
6:29
stakeholders in the market? Of course you have the competition
6:37
consumers. Then you have something called as the
6:44
context company and collaborators. Yes.
6:56
Okay. Now who can like control your profitability?
7:02
all the stakeholders but predominantly the profitability is controlled by the
7:07
competition and that is where we use the porters five sources to check that
7:14
okay who should understand your idea okay that should be done by all the
7:21
stakeholders but predominantly again your consumer should understand it and
7:26
that is where we use the IDA model or the CDM model Okay. So this is what we
7:32
have done so far. Right? Now let us come to today's topic. Listen.
7:38
Suppose you have come up with an idea. It is really really profitable. Means
7:43
you're going to make a lot of money. It is understandable. Means for your
7:49
consumers it is a very very high involvement idea.
7:53
Can you go ahead and start this business?
7:57
Can you go ahead and start this business? Again I'm repeating you have
8:01
come up with an idea it is going to be very profitable means there is almost no
8:06
competition. Okay if you start it you'll make a lot of money. Okay
8:12
the consumers also for them also it is a very high involvement idea. Okay they
8:16
will come and definitely purchase it. Can you start this business?
8:22
Yes. How many of you say yes we can go ahead and start this business? How many
8:27
of you say no boss? Still there can be some problem.
8:32
Anyone? 1 2 3 4 five. Why? What is the problem?
8:51
I suppose like you have the partners and capacity also.
8:55
You have the capability. Can you go and start the business?
9:00
How feasible it is? What is the meaning of feasible? If not profitable and
9:03
understandable, then it is feasible. No, it is doable. Okay, you can do it.
9:09
That's the capable part. Can you go ahead and start this business? Tell me.
9:14
Yes. Oh, that is something that comes later.
9:20
Segmentation, targeting, compositioning. I told you you are consumers mean say so
9:24
your segment is like willing to buy it. So what
9:39
that is okay but at least can you start the business that is what I'm asking
9:43
no I'll tell you okay some suppose there is
9:50
a problem okay there is an important thing that you are forgetting what is it
9:55
listen all of you folks Listen,
10:02
let's say let's take Dubai. My example might be a crass example in
10:09
Dubai also in India also. Sex toys.
10:14
Okay. And there's nothing to laugh. Sex toys.
10:20
Is there a need for sex toys? Yes. Because everybody seeks pleasure
10:27
and wants to experiment with pleasure. There's a problem.
10:32
Is sex toy a good solution for the problem? Yes, sex toys is a good
10:36
solution. Okay. We have not possibly tried it. So sex toy a lot of people try
10:42
it. Is this going to be a profitable
10:45
business in like a UAE? Yes. Why? Okay. There is a need. There
10:51
is going to be a solution in India. Okay. Is it going to be let's not take
10:55
UA let's take India. Is it going to be a profitable business?
10:59
Yes. Is this a very high involvement
11:03
business? Yes. As a consumer this is something an intimate consumption. So
11:08
I'll be very very careful about like what is the quality of the product that
11:11
I'm using. So it's going to be a high involvement purchase. Can I go ahead and
11:16
start this in India? Can I go ahead and start this business
11:22
in India? I cannot. Okay. Because legally it is
11:29
not possible to start this business. Okay. You cannot legally sell sex toys
11:35
in India. Same thing. You cannot legally sell sex toys in UAE.
11:40
Okay. Huh? So that is the thing. Okay. They will
11:45
not sell it as sex toys. Possibly they might sell it as massages or something
11:49
else. But you cannot legally sell it in India. And then you cannot legally sell
11:53
it in UAE. So you have an idea. Okay. You have I will give you a different
11:58
example. Marijuana
12:02
or ganja or pot. Okay. Is there a need for marijuana or pot?
12:10
Yes. All of you want to get high. Okay. Is marijuana a good solution for this?
12:17
Yes. Is it going to be profitable? Yes. Is it going to be a high
12:25
involvement purchase? Understandable by the consumer? Yes. Can you start the
12:30
business? Yes.
12:31
You cannot. You'll be behind bars. Okay. So why? Because even though you come up
12:37
with an idea, the idea the idea might be a profitable idea. The idea might be an
12:43
understandable idea. But still if it is not a feasible idea, you cannot start
12:48
it. Now what is this feasibility check? What is this feasibility check and how
12:53
can we modify this feasibility the barrier if at all there is a barrier
12:58
that is going to come. Let's try to look at it. The feasibility check is what is
13:03
the context check. The feasibility check is what is the context check. And if you
13:08
look at context what are the different context
13:11
you have elements. It is nothing but the political,
13:16
economic, socioultural,
13:26
technological, legal
13:31
and ecological or environmental. It's also called as the green or the
13:39
ecological context. Okay. Now the context might not allow
13:47
you to start a business. Now what is the meaning of the word context? Anybody can
13:51
you explain what does this context mean? No business just the business
13:57
environment. What does the context mean? You look at
14:01
it I have written political economic social cultural technological legal and
14:04
environmental. No, it's okay. It's not just the culture
14:12
part alone, right? Okay. Or the What is the meaning of the word context?
14:19
Keep the phones away, please. What is the meaning of the word context?
14:24
Yes. What is the meaning of the rules
14:30
regulations? Anybody can in business also there are rules, regulations. Okay.
14:39
No. Okay, that's not just that's just a bit superficial. Okay, think a bit
14:44
deeper. Uh it's just is it just conditions? Okay,
14:51
now if you look at the market, listen, if you look at the market, who are all
14:56
present inside the market? You'll have competition inside the
15:01
market. Consumers are present inside the market. Companies present inside. Your
15:07
collaborators are also present inside the market.
15:10
But the context is the non-market force. Okay, the context is the non-market
15:17
external force that can come and stop your business. Okay, that is exactly
15:22
what is the context. Now tell it is not the it's not the business ecosystem but
15:29
it is the non-b businessiness ecosystem non-b businessiness actors who can come
15:33
and I'm going to close the store because my voice is going
15:38
not able to control okay the context is the non-market
15:48
forces that can come and stop your business now tell me out of these six
15:53
forces Which is the most difficult force to
15:56
overcome? How many of you say legal is the most
16:00
difficult force to overcome? 1 2 3.
16:05
How many of you say social cultural is the most difficult force to overcome?
16:09
How many of you say like a political is the most difficult force to overcome?
16:15
Okay. Of course, technological, economic, and ecological you don't even
16:19
give a [ __ ] about. Okay. Now let's try to understand this thing. Now I'll give
16:26
you a real problem and tell me I'll give you two problems to explain like which
16:31
is the most difficult context to overcome. First thing suppose
16:37
uh but it's a moral
16:44
yeah the thing is that's that's the thing. Okay.
16:49
So you are saying it is not legal. So legal context is the most difficult
16:52
thing to over. Maybe we will take it. Okay. Listen now all of you listen. This
16:58
is an actual problem that I started my research on. Okay. In India. See suppose
17:04
you are going to be the CEO of McDonald's India. Okay. You're going to
17:09
be the CEO of McDonald's India. Now throughout the world
17:16
in McDonald's which is considered as the most tastiest burger?
17:21
The Big Mac. Okay. How many of you have tried a Big Mac here in the class?
17:26
A Big Mac. Okay. See, throughout the world, Big Mac is
17:33
considered as the most juiciest and the most tastiest burger. Okay. Out of all
17:39
the burgers, is there a need for Big Mac in India?
17:47
Yes. People would want to eat tasty food. Okay. And juicy food. There is a
17:53
need. Is Big Mac one of the solutions for it? Yes. Big Mac is possibly one of
18:00
the better solutions for it. Is this going to be profitable in India?
18:07
Yes, it will be profitable in India. You just do not know India. That is the
18:11
problem. You know only the southern part of northern part of India. Southern part
18:15
of India. Okay. The staple food is beef. Can I? So, is it going to be a very high
18:21
involvement idea? Yes. But can I go ahead and launch this in India?
18:28
Can I? Why? What's the legal issues?
18:33
Huh? So, what sort of issues?
18:43
Okay. It is it's a political see the thing is that
18:49
legally it is at least in northern part of India
18:53
legally you cannot sell beef burger okay of course the political environment is
19:00
also problematic okay the current political party will not allow the beef
19:04
burger are these too difficult to overcome no
19:12
political and legal is not a very big Okay, tomorrow the current political
19:16
party might be in power. Tomorrow the political party that is in power might
19:19
go out. That is not a big deal. Legally also you can lobby well. Okay. And like
19:26
try to modify stuff. But socioulturally people do not eat beef. Okay. North
19:34
India socioulturally a lot of people do not eat beef because they see a cow as a
19:40
holy thing. Okay. It is a embodiment of one of their goddesses
19:45
and that is the most difficult thing to overcome. That is the most difficult
19:50
thing to overcome. Okay. Even if at all see tomorrow if the Supreme Court of
19:55
India announces a particular directive that like you have to give protection to
20:00
this particular shop. Okay. Easily like the government okay can be overcome. The
20:05
political can be overcome very very easily. The legal can be overcome very
20:09
easily. But socioulturally, okay, people will not consume beef. That
20:15
is going to take a lot of time to overcome. It is going to take years to
20:19
overcome. And anybody who overcomes any one of this barrier will be a market
20:26
creator again. Any one of you if you're able to overcome any one of the barriers
20:34
okay you will be a market creator here also you'll be a market creator
20:40
but it is going to take years to overcome this particular thing
20:48
okay so how will you overcome suppose you are make the CEO how can you
20:53
overcome can you even overcome No, that is not overcoming. I have to
21:04
introduce my product, not the next best option.
21:08
Huh? Oh yes, you can. In southern part of India, you can. But how will you
21:13
change this mindset? That is what I'm saying. Okay. Because if you have to
21:16
become a market creator, you have to create the market for that product, not
21:20
for something else. Okay? Yes.
21:24
Now you have to change people's opinion. How will you
21:30
It's not about changing the religion. Okay.
21:42
Not necessarily. Not necessarily. Okay. See, in India, you do not even know.
21:48
Okay. It is not like the other religious people who eat beef the most. Do you
21:53
know who eats the beef the most in India?
21:56
It is the lowerass people. Okay. It is the people in the lowest straighta
22:01
because beef is considered as the poor man's meat. Many people in India itself
22:05
do not know that. Okay. Many people in India upperass Muslims or the upper
22:11
class Christians they do not even touch beef in India.
22:15
Okay. That's a very wrong misconception and many of you people have. Okay. India
22:20
does not eat. It's a very very wrong statement to make. In India it is
22:25
majorly consumed by the lowerass people. Okay. The one of the reason see this is
22:32
the problem. Okay. When we think that we know a cultural context well you
22:36
actually do not. It is seen as a a lowercast meat. Okay.
22:43
Or lower cast food. That is why it is not being touched.
22:48
Okay. See many people do not know how when did Christianity come to India?
22:53
Anyone here when did Christianity reach India? Anyone here knows that?
23:00
17th or the 18th century? Why? Because Britishers came and say they brought
23:04
Christianity. Okay, that is wrong. Do you know when Christianity reached
23:09
India? Okay, Christianity reached India in 52
23:15
AD. 2,000 years before India had Christianity before Europe became
23:21
Christian. Europe became Christian and in the 4th century AD. Okay. When
23:27
Constantine was baptized on his deathbed and the entire empire of Rome was
23:31
proclaimed as Christian. Okay. India became India had the Syrian
23:38
Christian church in India is 2,000 years old.
23:42
Okay. Many see that is the thing right when you're entering a particular
23:46
country you should know this contextual history so that it makes it easy. So
23:52
I'll tell you like what this is a very interesting case one I'll just talk
23:57
about it for two minutes listen something very very interesting uh my
24:01
why am I able to talk with this authority is because my first work was
24:05
on the consumption of beef my first research work was on the consumption of
24:09
beef so I went to India to my own village okay to do this particular
24:14
research okay so what had happened was when I was born
24:20
in 1988 age. Okay. So when in 1995 when I was 7 8 years old, okay,
24:27
hardly there was a single beef shop in India. There was not a single beef shop.
24:31
Uh not India mean in my village. There was only one beef shop that too was
24:36
present in the lower cast. Okay. Colony. Okay.
24:42
In 2015 when I was doing this research, there were beef shops anywhere and
24:47
everywhere. Anywhere and everywhere. every street corner there was beef shop
24:52
in like a Tamil Nadu in the place where I was doing my research. I was just
24:57
wondering what changed what changed okay why because like in 20
25:03
years the the lower class population was still like the same will not have
25:07
increased like rapidly right so somebody from the upper class is
25:12
eating okay so I was wondering why was this happening
25:17
so I went to and tried to talk to the people okay from upper cast okay and uh
25:23
they were asking I asked them Why are you like now starting to eat? And I saw
25:28
like 15 guys, okay, had come in a um sort of a bus kind of setting and like
25:34
they were ordering beef biryani, beef pakoda and like beef soup and
25:37
everything. Okay, I was asking okay boss sir why are you eating and this is
25:44
exactly what like they said see 30 years before beef was a cast ostracization
25:50
food means like you just consume beef okay you'll be removed from your cast
25:55
okay or you lose all dignity but today what had happened was because
26:04
there was something called as a reservation which is equal to the
26:07
affirmative action that was set in in India. Okay. So all the lowerass people
26:13
had got jobs like the upper class guys. Okay. Jobs and employment like the upper
26:18
class guys or they started to come up the status. And what is the staple food
26:22
of the lowerass guys? Beef, right? So because
26:27
it is a high protein diet, they had a nice physique. Okay. They had a very
26:32
ripped body. So what had happened was the upper class girls started to fancy
26:38
them and they started to elope and get married to the lowerass guys. So now
26:43
this upper class guy has to hold on to the girl. Okay, because it is their cast
26:48
right their community. So what they did was because now the guy has come equal
26:54
in status in employment. So this guy has to hold on. Okay. So they go to the gym
27:00
and in the gym they say if you want to have a quick six-pack body okay you have
27:04
to eat high quality protein which is beef. So they cannot eat it in their
27:08
village okay so because they will be lynched okay so they travel around some
27:13
50 60 kilometers to just to have this okay so that they can compete with the
27:18
upper cast guys to hold to a girl. So what was a because in the last 30 years
27:26
there is a redefinition of what masculinity in India. Okay. Only people
27:31
with ripped body were considered as hyper masculine because movies made that
27:35
kind of a a change. So this was a socioultural transformation that has
27:40
happened and that is why okay that is why beef is not anymore a political
27:46
product. It is a masculinity inducing product. That is the key that like you
27:51
have to understand in order to like even know pitch this as a very different
27:56
product. That's what is the socioultural market creation all about. Imagine now
28:02
you go and tell an 18year-old guy, oh boss, if you want to get laid or if you
28:07
want to like have a six-pack body, you eat beef. Will the guy keep quiet or
28:12
like will he say no no no religious okay or like it is goddess kind of a thing.
28:17
He will come and eat without his family knowing it. Okay. And that is the market
28:22
creation process. This nuance you have to get it. This nuance you have to get
28:27
it. For this it will take time say 20 years, 30 years to change this
28:32
particular mindset. Are you able to get it? How many Hindus
28:37
are there or in this class? How many people? How many of you here who are
28:42
Hindus? Okay. Have consumed a Big Mac? H not that's not my Big Mac. Okay. So
28:50
this is a very small number. Okay. But if you go outside in India a lot of
28:54
people who have visited outside they have consumed Big Mac. So this notion of
29:00
like this is God that is reducing. So it is time to capitalize. Are you able to
29:05
get it? Okay. So this is exactly what is the market creation process. I will give
29:10
you one more example then we will talk about the other things. What is the
29:14
quest for pink money? What is pink money?
29:18
Anyone here? Huh?
29:22
What is pink money? Huh?
29:29
Sorry. No, no, no, no.
29:38
Exactly. The money that you get from the LGBTQPA population, that is what is
29:42
called as the pink money. Okay. See today in the US the quest for the
29:48
pink money is in full swing. Have you wondered okay in the last 10
29:54
years you see a lot of LGBTQA content okay in like your Netflix, Amazon Prime
30:01
and all these other things right? Why? Why? Huh? Marketers do not care about
30:09
any change. They care only about money. Okay. Marketers do not care about
30:13
equality. H
30:17
it's a growing trend. It's not a growing trend. The trend was always there. Okay.
30:24
Huh? No.
30:28
No. Market is growing. Why? Listen. See this
30:33
is something very very very important. Listen.
30:38
No. Okay. No boss. Actually that is not the case.
30:43
Okay. Many of many people thought that no no awareness has increased. Keep the
30:47
phones away and listen or like the market has increased. No.
30:52
Do you know who's the most richest population? Okay. Richest group in the
30:57
US. Huh? Jewish Americans. Yeah. Right.
31:02
Jewish Americans is the most richest. Who's the second most richest group?
31:08
Huh? The Indian Americans. Okay. Who is the
31:12
third most richest group in the US? The LGBTQ Americans.
31:19
Okay, LGBTK Americans. People were wondering how did this happen? Okay. And
31:25
this is where in a very interesting see listen how did the LGBTQ Americans
31:30
become the most richest and 50 years of data was taken and and they were trying
31:36
to look at now if you look at the see I'm not for or against any particular
31:41
group. So listen if you look at the entire US okay listen if you look at the
31:48
entire US the central part of US is what is the red states this is the Trump
31:55
states okay where this is where Trump won majorly
32:00
okay this is also the state where it is completely against LGBTQA okay
32:06
population means their acceptance the coastal US is where the blue states
32:13
stay. This is what is accepting of LGBT gay
32:19
population. Okay. Now suppose if there is a person who
32:23
born here okay and identifies themselves as LGBTQA
32:30
person will they be able to live safely and like openly in red states. So in
32:37
order to live safely and openly what should they do? They have to migrate to
32:41
the blue states. But what are the blue states?
32:45
California, New York, Connecticut, Delaware. Are they cheap?
32:50
They are the most costliest. Most expensive states. So in order to
32:55
stay comfortably in an expensive state, what should you do?
32:58
You have to make a lot of money. In order to make a lot of money, what do
33:02
you do? You have to get a better job. In order to get a better job, what do you
33:06
have to do? You have to have a better education. So that is why this group in
33:10
the last 50 years have identified keep the phone away.
33:15
They saw that was by me getting a better job only I will be able to escape to
33:21
freedom. Okay. So for that I have to study a lot. So this this became the
33:27
most educated group and they became like professors, teachers, okay, lawyers,
33:31
doctors, judges kind of a thing and they have very deeper pockets.
33:36
Okay. They have very deeper pockets and trying to get that money out is what is
33:42
called as the quest for paying money. This is the reason why in the last 30
33:48
years or 40 years this socioultural change has happened and that is why you
33:53
are seeing so much of okay LGBT related content and LGBTK related products
34:02
and this is a worldwide trend that is happening not just because it is okay
34:07
about equality it is more about this particular population has become a lot
34:12
lot lot rich okay because they have seen education as
34:17
a way of like a freedom. Are you able to get it? So if at all you
34:23
can start a business, okay, for example, an Amazon for an LGBT
34:28
population, okay, or any footwear for this particular population, any
34:33
particular brand for that for that matter, okay, you will be able to make a
34:39
lot of money. Okay. So this is exactly what is the contextual market making
34:44
process or the market creating process. Are you with me? Are are you with me? So
34:50
political and legal is not a big deal. Okay. Political and legal is not a big
34:55
deal. Okay. Yes. It is a big deal. Okay. Depends on which country you stay. For
35:00
example, in the Middle East, political and legal are very very big barriers to
35:05
overcome. socioultural barrier is the one that drives the political and the
35:09
legal barriers. Now what is the economic barrier? Economic barrier is the
35:14
macroeconomic barrier. Today Trump is going crazy and he's doing every drama
35:18
possible. Okay. Like so all those taxes and tariffs that can make businesses
35:24
that can like also start new businesses. Yes. Okay. So that is what is the
35:31
macroeconomic barrier. For example, last two years whenever like my students
35:36
came, I was having a very candid conversation with Pratam. Okay, I was
35:41
talking to Pratam and I said like we are talking about creating new businesses,
35:45
right? But why are we not making our students start new
35:52
businesses? Why are we sending them to jobs? And Pratam was very candidly
35:56
telling Besh you also know and I also know that very well that there is a
36:01
funding winter happening in India means like the investors were not willing to
36:05
open uh their pockets. That is why the last
36:10
two years okay there were a lot of less startups started based out of India.
36:16
Okay. So today okay there is a lot lot lot more or opening up of the process
36:21
has happened. Okay. So that is where okay the economic barrier can come and
36:26
make or break your business. Okay. Now today what is that one word you say as a
36:33
mantra okay you'll immediately get a funding
36:36
AI okay so take that is a technological barrier A can come and make businesses A
36:43
can come and break businesses okay he said that right boss I'm going to like
36:48
start a human chatbot okay human personal assistant he's going to start a
36:53
business because of the technological barrier has changed okay similarly
36:58
anybody who has not adopted AI will lose their business
37:02
in in in the world it is AI but in Europe what is that one word that will
37:07
immediately get a funding not a huh first ability okay so when I
37:15
was teaching in France one student who was like you 20 years old he came to me
37:21
and said like sir take some chocolates he offered a bag of chocolates I was
37:26
like why what's the good news I have got What a great funding. How? I said how
37:30
much? $10 million. I said like wow $10 million not even
37:35
like wow what are you building? I am building sustainable packaging. Okay. I
37:41
said like what the heck is that? Okay. He said that I'm using Araka leaves.
37:46
Okay. To like construct Ara plates and sustainable packaging. Damn. This is the
37:50
same thing that Indian idiots have been doing it for the last 100 years. But
37:54
like you say the word sustainability boom you get like funding in in Europe.
37:59
This is the environmental context. Okay. So the context can make business it can
38:07
come and break business as well. See you can listen you can move with the context
38:14
and make a business. You can move against the context and make a business.
38:19
What is the meaning of it? Suppose there is an LGBT care trend happening in the
38:24
US. You can start a business by moving with the trend.
38:28
You can start a business but moving against the trend also.
38:33
Both the things are possible. Okay. Both the things are possible. You can start a
38:38
business by moving with the trend. You can start a business by moving against
38:42
the trend. You can start say that I'm going to start for an Amazon for LGBT
38:46
population. You can simply say that was LGBT is madness. Okay, I'm going to
38:52
start a company which will stop which will not cater to the LGBT business.
38:59
Both the things can make a business are able to get it. You can make a business
39:05
by moving with the trend or by moving against the trend. So context can
39:09
actually open a lot of businesses. And many of you asked right how do you build
39:15
a cult brand? If you're able to anchor to a socioultural context that is when
39:22
you can build a cult brand. That is when you can build a cult brand.
39:27
Are you able to get it? Any questions? Any questions?
39:33
Yes. depends on how much capability you have.
39:58
Okay. So both I I told you both the things can make a business. Okay. You
40:03
want to move for example say in the US itself. Let's take the US. Okay.
40:09
There are some people who say who are saying that bos we have to move with the
40:12
LGBT trend and we have to start this business today after Trump has come to
40:18
power okay they're saying that like this LGBT population is corrupting children
40:22
and so we have to like go back so both the things can start and happen okay
40:29
what is it that like you want to latch on to here also you'll make money here
40:33
also you'll make money but what is that you want to do that depends on your
40:38
value system that depends on like your um how to say your capability as simple
40:45
as that. Got it? Okay. Both the and businesses are happening in both the
40:49
places. For example, there are a lot of businesses starting against Trump. There
40:55
are a lot of businesses starting with Trump. Both businesses are possible. But
41:00
like how do you start? That is on you. Okay. If you look at the MAGA cult, that
41:04
is also a cult. Okay. It is moving with Trump. The so-called Antifa cult. Okay,
41:11
that is also a cult that is moving against Trump.
41:15
Okay, because Trump is in power, MAGA cult is gaining some prominence.
41:20
Tomorrow if Trump goes out of power, that might weaken. So you have to see
41:24
like how do you handle this gap. Are you able to get it? Any questions?
41:30
Okay, great. Now let us say you have a business that
41:36
is profitable, understandable and feasible. Can you go ahead and start
41:41
this business? No. Why? Because you might not have the
41:47
capability to do that other way around. Say suppose you have a business that is
41:53
not profitable, not feasible, not capable, not u understandable but you
41:59
have the capability to start the business. Can you go ahead and start the
42:03
business? Yes. Okay. So that is why capability can overrule all these three
42:10
things. Capability can overrule all of these
42:13
three things. That is why I always write capability separately. Okay? Not just
42:19
because I did not have like a space at the top. Okay. Are you able to get it?
42:23
If you are capable still like you can go ahead and like start this business. Are
42:28
you able to get it? Now how do you check what is the capability?
42:34
Okay. So that is exactly where we are going to look at the most abused
42:38
framework in like marketing which is the SWAT
42:43
analysis. Are you able to get it? What is this
42:47
SWAT? Okay,
42:50
how many of you have done a SWAT analysis so far? All of you would have
42:54
done. The only problem is most of you would have done it wrong. Okay, so that
42:58
is where like we have to understand what is the SWAT analysis. Listen, we'll
43:02
finish the SWAT and then we will take a break.
43:06
What is the SWAT analysis? The SWAT is nothing but a strengths,
43:14
weaknesses, opportunities
43:24
and threats analysis. Listen, a SWAT is a strength, weakness, opportunities and
43:31
threats analysis. Now the thing is that this is the full form
43:40
of SWAT. Okay. But what how do we do this analysis? This is a SWAT is a
43:46
company analysis. Listen a SWAT is a company analysis.
43:57
Moreover, it is an internal external analysis. What is the meaning of it? It
44:03
is an internal external analysis. Okay.
44:09
So the strengths and weaknesses are something that is internal to the
44:13
organization. The opportunities and threats lie
44:17
outside the organization. Okay. The strengths and weaknesses are something
44:21
that are internal to the organization. And the opportunities and threats lie
44:25
outside the organization. This is okay. Some of you might have done it like
44:29
this. This is what like you would not have done every strength. So how would
44:35
you have done? Typically how do you do? Okay, you look at the industry reports
44:39
also they would write oh these are the strengths, these are the weaknesses,
44:44
this is what is the opportunity, this is the threat and they just finish it off.
44:48
This is wrong. That is not how you do it. You just do
44:52
not write the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. What you do is
44:57
every strength should lead to an opportunity otherwise it is not a
45:01
strength. Every opportunity must be mapped to a
45:07
strength. Every opportunity should be mapped to a
45:11
strength. Sometimes one strength might lead to more than one opportunity. Keep
45:16
the phone away. or two or more strengths might lead to
45:24
one opportunity but if the opportunity is not mapped to a strength then it is
45:29
not an opportunity. Similarly, every it's okay.
45:42
Come on. Sit here.
45:49
Yes. That now listen. Every strength, every strength should be mapped to an
45:56
every opportunity should be mapped to a strength. Otherwise, it is not like an
46:00
an opportunity. For example, okay, let us say
46:05
the let us do a SWAT for Teter. Let us say the finance faculty is the strength
46:13
of Teter. Let's say the finance faculty is the
46:18
strength of Teter. What can Tetar do? T can start a bachelor's in
46:26
finance. It can start a bachelor's in finance.
46:35
Okay. Or it can have a lot of PE and VC roles coming for internship because the
46:43
finance faculty is the strength. Okay. They can train you better in like
46:46
finance and like you'll crack a lot of private equity and like a venture
46:50
capitalist roles. Only if the strength is there, this
46:54
opportunities exist. If at all you do not have this strength, if at all you do
46:58
not have the strength, will this be your opportunity?
47:02
It is somebody else's opportunity. Okay, of course the bachelors in finance in a
47:07
tetra model is an interesting thing. There is a need for that. But it does
47:12
not become your opportunity till you have the strength. So every strength
47:17
okay should be leading to an opportunity otherwise it is not a strength right now
47:24
similarly every threat should stem out of a weakness otherwise it is not a
47:31
threat for example let us say you are like vazer vazer is one of the crypto
47:36
trading platforms in India suppose
47:42
the Indian government came with this rule that there will be 30%age tax on
47:46
cryptocurrency. Okay. Cryptocurrency earnings. There's a
47:50
30%age tax. Okay. Is this a threat?
47:56
Why is it a threat to baser? Because it has a weakness. What is the weakness
48:00
here? The weakness is it operated based out of India. Suppose it had operated
48:05
based out of Dubai. Would it have been a weakness? Would it
48:09
have been a threat? No. So the threat becomes a threat only when you have the
48:14
weakness. Sometimes the weakness can be a hidden weakness otherwise it is not a
48:18
threat. Every threat should stem out of a weakness. Okay. For example, let us
48:24
say the marketing faculty is the weakness of Twitter.
48:28
I know because I teach you. Okay. Then what is going to happen? Possibly
48:34
students who might be interested in marketing, they might join some other
48:37
school or some of the marketing roles. You'll not be able to crack the
48:49
internships. You might not be able to crack the
48:54
internships. That is why possibly okay it becomes a threat. Are you able to get
48:59
it? Are you able to get it? So only if you have the weakness okay you there
49:04
will be a threat. Any questions? Yes.
49:12
No for the company for the company not the product. Okay. The product here is
49:17
BMS the the uh AI courses. These are the two different products. But we are not
49:22
doing it for the product. We are doing it for Teter as a company. Got it? Now
49:27
let me ask a final one question. Suppose you are having an idea which is
49:33
profitable, understandable, feasible but you are not
49:37
capable of doing this idea. Can you go ahead and start this business?
49:42
Yes. Okay. Not by yourself but if you bring
49:46
the collaborators. Okay. If you bring in someone who can
49:51
bring in the strength. Okay. So that is exactly what is the collaborators. But
49:57
this collaborator C is the only C that we will not see. Okay, this is the only
50:04
collaborator C is the only C that we will not see in this course. Why?
50:08
Because there is a complete course called as management strategy that you
50:12
will do in semester 2, okay? Or semester 3. So you'll learn about that there.
50:18
Okay. Who can be your collaborators? How do you like handle the uh supply chain
50:24
and all these other stuff? Okay. Now, now like you have come up with an idea.
50:30
Listen, you have come up with an idea and this idea is a very viable idea. Now
50:36
what is the next step? The next step is what is the most important topic of this
50:43
entire course that is who is my customer?
50:50
Okay, who's my customer or like a what is the customer segmentation all about?
51:01
Okay. So, I want all of you to completely focus on this topic. Okay.
51:08
Let's take a 5 minutes break and come back by 9:30. Okay. Segmentation will go
51:13
for today, tomorrow and day after tomorrow. I want all of you to like
51:17
understand this topic. If you do not understand segmentation, you can better
51:21
leave the program. Okay? This is the vital thing for everything. Okay? So
51:26
come back because I need only that part. Oh, I
51:36
I'll do it. I'll do it. No, I'll do it. I'll do it.
51:49
Yes. Tell me get it.
52:03
You got inside. Now settle down.
52:26
Settle down all of you. Now all of you
52:33
please keep your mobile phones away for all the other topics. It was okay.
52:40
Close all your lap all of your laptops. This is one topic where I don't want
52:46
anything. Only tabs are allowed if you are making notes. But today's session
52:50
for the next 25 minutes, you need not even make notes. Listen.
52:59
Come in. Come in. Come in. Quick. Now I want all of you to focus. This is the
53:05
most important topic that you will learn in your entire four years. I'm not even
53:11
exaggerating. Okay? Segmentation is extremely important because everything
53:16
comes down to segmentation. I want all of you to listen. All of you
53:22
to listen and participate as well. What is
53:27
segmentation? Anyone? What what do you think is segmentation?
53:32
You can say it in as simple words as possible. Yes.
53:36
Division and classification. Divide and rule. Okay. Uh
53:40
same thing. Okay. So what is this division all about? Who are you
53:44
dividing? Consumers. Why should you divide
53:48
consumers? A targeting comes data. Okay. Now
53:53
listen. See in the 1960s itself marketers
53:59
understood boss keep the phone away. keep the phone away. Today this topic I
54:03
will not allow all the other topics fine I don't just don't mind but today's
54:07
topic is extremely important so listen see 1960 itself marketers identified and
54:17
understood that every consumer is different every consumer is different so
54:23
can I create one one solution for every customer is it even possible no right
54:30
Okay. So that is where segmentation is a process by which you are going to group
54:36
consumers. Okay. Segmentation is a process means all consumers are
54:42
different. Everybody is different. Okay. So can we group the consumers on the
54:47
basis of something that is common between them? Okay. So creating a
54:53
homogeneous group. Segmentation is nothing but a creating a homogeneous
54:59
group. This is a homogeneous group from a heterogeneous population.
55:18
Okay, again I'm repeating segmentation is the process by which you create a
55:24
homogeneous group. Means every customer is different. Every individual is
55:30
different. So they are heterogeneous. Can I create a homogeneous group
55:42
from a heterogeneous population? This is what is segmentation means everybody in
55:47
this group should have something in common. Okay. Everybody in this group
55:52
should have something in common. Right? What is the thing that is common for
55:56
everybody in the group? H
56:02
no you want to be entrepreneurs that's fine
56:10
okay we are talking about the consumers okay it is grouping consumers right okay
56:17
it is grouping consumers their needs okay all of them listen all
56:23
of them inside the group should have a common problem. All of these individuals
56:29
inside the group should have a common problem or the need should be same. That
56:35
is why this is called as needbased segmentation. That is the full form of
56:40
segmentation or the full name of segmentation is
56:44
need- based segmentation. Now tell me how do you group them? How
56:51
do you group these people on the basis of what?
56:56
customer values. Then financial power means income.
57:02
Okay. Huh. Attitude. Then what else? How do you group these people? Huh? Age,
57:11
gender. Okay. Let me write. So what are they called as? Age, gender,
57:17
demographics. Now listen all of you, all of you listen. Demographics.
57:24
What are the different demographics? Age, she said, gender, then
57:33

57:41
region or location, then ethnicity or race, then
57:51
sexuality. Wonderful. preferences is not taste preferences is
57:56
not demographics. I'm just writing the demographics. Now this is more than
58:00
sufficient. Now tell me give me an example of a product that you have
58:07
segmented on the basis of age. Alcohol diapers. Okay, let me write it.
58:18
Okay, wait. Diapers,

Okay. Sexuality. Sex toys.
1:00:10
Condoms. That's okay. Fine. Not now. This is sufficient to kill all of
1:00:16
you for the next half an hour. Listen all of you.
1:00:21
You only said that like you're grouping all of this on the basis of these
1:00:24
demographics. Now I I want all of you keep your phone away. Keep your phone
1:00:28
away because now we are going to unlearn something that like you have taken for
1:00:33
granted. Diapers. Who said diapers? Ah, you're the diaper lady. Now tell me
1:00:39
that's diapers. On the basis of what?
1:00:43
Age. What is the age group? Either.
1:00:46
That's okay. Let's take the younger one. What is the age group?
1:00:50
Give me a 3 months.
1:00:54
Okay. Zero day. Okay. 0 to three. Now listen all of you. All of you listen.
1:01:01
0 to three. That is what she said. right now. Have you seen a 4mon-old baby crawl
1:01:11
to a store and say, "I will buy only pampers and not huggies."
1:01:15
Then okay, you only said 0 to three, right?
1:01:24
Wait, you when you said you have tried to kick a ball, let me score. Okay. Then
1:01:31
like we will like you don't change the goalpost. Okay. You only said 0 to three
1:01:38
first. What is a diaper? What is a diaper? A diaper?
1:01:45
What is a diaper? What problem does diaper solve? Do babies care about where
1:01:50
they [ __ ] or piss? No. They will [ __ ] on your face if you
1:01:54
allow them to. That is what babies do. They [ __ ] and piss everywhere.
1:01:59
Okay. They do not care about wearing a diapers. In fact, children are extremely
1:02:04
upset about diapers. It is uncomfortable for them. They want to be naked running
1:02:09
around. Okay. Children hate diapers.
1:02:15
Is diaper solving the problem of a child?
1:02:19
Whose problem is it solving? Parents. See, as a young parent, you
1:02:23
love your kid. Okay? Why? Because you made it. Okay?
1:02:29
At the same time, you also love your beauty sleep. As a young mom or as a
1:02:35
young dad, you really love your kid. But what constantly, okay, one of your hands
1:02:41
is always under the baby's butt. Why? Because you love your kid, but at
1:02:47
the same time, okay, you want to sleep as well, but like you do not want the
1:02:52
baby to swim in its own [ __ ] purpose. Yes or no?
1:02:58
So who is the problem that the diaper is solving? Is it the baby's problem or is
1:03:02
it the parents problem? Then what is the age group? 0 to three
1:03:06
or something else? What is that something else? Tell me.
1:03:09
Now you change the goalpost. You are saying 28 to what?
1:03:13
28 to 30. 35. You give me one number.
1:03:18
28. 28 to 35. So can't a 36 year old person
1:03:23
have a baby? Then can't a 20-year-old person have a baby?
1:03:29
Then then tell me what is the age group? All of you listen. All of you listen.
1:03:34
Huh? 18 to
1:03:38
let me listen. Folks, are you going to listen to me or
1:03:44
not? One at a time. I will allow everybody to
1:03:48
talk. We are trying to unlearn here. Tell me.
1:03:51
18. 18 and above. 18 to what? 20
1:03:56
18 to 50.
1:03:59
So a 65 year old grandmother cannot buy a diaper for her granddaughter
1:04:06
18 to 100 or 120. Can't a 14year-old
1:04:13
brother buy a diaper for her sister? Then huh 0 to 120? Then how are you
1:04:21
segmenting on the basis of age? No, that is targeting. That is not
1:04:28
segmentation. You said 18 250, right? I am a 38 year old person. I don't have a
1:04:34
baby. So you what have you done? You have put me in the group.
1:04:39
That's the thing. Then is that a homogeneous group? What you have
1:04:44
created? Is that a homogeneous group? That is a smaller heterogeneous group
1:04:48
from a larger heterogeneous group. Have you done segmentation?
1:04:52
So you said 18 to 150 right here. What have you done? You have put
1:05:00
some people like me who do not have so in a from a larger heterogeneous group
1:05:06
you have created a smaller heterogeneous group. Have you done segmentation?
1:05:11
So can you segment on the basis of age for diapers?
1:05:15
Can a 70 year old individual need a diaper for like himself or herself? Yes.
1:05:21
If you are a geriatric patient and if you are traveling okay
1:05:25
it provides you with the independence you cannot you need not go
1:05:30
to the toilet every 5 minutes or 10 minutes can a 25 year old individual
1:05:35
need a diaper yes if they are under sedation if they
1:05:40
are injured the diaper is something convenience for the nurses and all the
1:05:46
other people can a perfectly normal 25 year old individual will need a diaper.
1:05:52
Yes. Yes. No. Not about a child. For
1:05:55
themselves. Yes. If you are a Formula 1 racer, you wear a
1:06:00
diaper. Why? Because you cannot like simply say that like boss I will like
1:06:06
try to like Yes. Formula 1 racers wear diapers. You do not wear most of the
1:06:12
Formula 1 racers wear diapers. Okay. Why? Because you just cannot simply say
1:06:18
boss I'll take a bio break and I lose the pole position
1:06:23
boss just because you do not know okay doesn't mean it is wrong okay he
1:06:29
possibly he is a formula 1 racer okay he is not wearing one lot of formula 1
1:06:33
today like formula 1 race has changed okay earlier you know you have to do
1:06:39
multiple laps for four hours five hours formula 1 if you're a fighter pilot and
1:06:45
taking a sorty from like a Hawaii to Okinawa and back. You cannot say I will
1:06:50
take a bio break. The plane will go down into the Pacific.
1:06:54
So everybody who cannot urinate or defecate at will. All these people need
1:07:01
diapers. How do you segment on the basis of age?
1:07:11
That is targeting. That's not segmentation.
1:07:14
What we talking about is targeting and positioning. Here what we are talking
1:07:18
about is segmentation. Grouping individuals on the basis of their
1:07:21
problems. That is what is se that is how we define
1:07:26
right. We created homogeneous group means everybody who has the problem
1:07:30
should be in the group. There can be subgroups inside it. Adults and children
1:07:35
are able to get it. You cannot segment on the basis of age. You cannot you
1:07:41
cannot group on the basis of age. Now I told you okay let me ask a different
1:07:45
question who said alcohol you
1:07:50
let me ask a simple question what is your age
1:07:53
19 what is the legal age in your like
1:07:59
in your in your country what is the legal age 18 when did you drink alcohol
1:08:04
first 16 so then what is the age group Okay.
1:08:12
For example, when did you watch your first adult movie?
1:08:17
It's okay. Tell. That's okay. Tell me some age.
1:08:23
15, 16. Oh, you go to the website. It asks, "Are you 18 years or older?" What
1:08:30
do you do? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And you go inside. Do you not or do you
1:08:34
or do you not? You say, "Oh, no, no, no. I'm not 18 years or older. I will just
1:08:39
step back." Do you do that? Okay. So that is the problem now like
1:08:45
there can be 38 I'm 38 years old. I do not want to watch an adult movie.
1:08:51
Okay. So what is the age? What is the age for a alcohol or like an adult
1:08:58
movie? What is the age? No.
1:09:02
There is no age. Do you really think everybody from 15 to 120 is going to
1:09:06
drink? I am a 38 year old person. I do not drink. So you can you segment on the
1:09:12
basis of H then how did you segment on the basis of H?
1:09:17
You cannot segment on the basis of H. Yes.
1:09:21
But you are still a potential customer if you want.
1:09:24
So then like anybody can be a potential customer. Then what is the point of
1:09:27
segmentation? Anybody can be a potential customer.
1:09:32
Right? Then why do you even segment? Just to go blabber [ __ ]
1:09:37
H every single case.
1:09:43
I will show you how to do a segmentation without exceptions. Boss, now just
1:09:48
because you cannot do it does not mean that is the right thing.
1:09:52
I will show you how to do it. Okay. Currently, we are trying to unlearn. You
1:09:58
have thought that you can segment on the basis of demographics. That's wrong.
1:10:03
Whatever has been taught to you so far is wrong. I will show you how to segment
1:10:07
without demographics. It will come demographics is not used
1:10:14
for plus grouping. It is used for profiling. We will come we'll come to
1:10:19
that. First you only said and I'm just trying to come and negate every point.
1:10:24
Now who said religion? Idols. Who said idols? You. So
1:10:31
what is it on the basis of which religion? Hindus.
1:10:35
Let me say so listen this is the world population
1:10:41
and what he's saying is every Hindu will buy a idol. Do all Hindus buy idols? I
1:10:48
am a Hindu. I don't buy idols. Can't a Christian or a Muslim person
1:10:53
like buy an idol? Wow. Who said they don't? They can as a
1:10:58
gift piece. I can buy an idol as a gift piece. Why
1:11:04
can't I buy? Yes or no? Then is it on the basis of
1:11:10
religion or is it on the basis of willingness to buy? Willingness to buy.
1:11:15
That is not demographics. Okay. You have assumed that everybody Hindus will buy
1:11:22
it. That's wrong. Why can't a non-Hindu buy a idol? They
1:11:27
can buy and gift it to a Hindu person or they can buy it as a collective piece.
1:11:33
Then how did you segment on the basis of religion? Did you create a homogeneous
1:11:37
group? You created a smaller heterogeneous
1:11:40
group from a larger heterogeneous group. Is that segmentation? Then
1:11:51
who said jackets on the basis of location?
1:11:56
Which location? Who you and again? Useless fellow. Okay. Now tell me which
1:12:02
location? Canada. Okay. Let me say Canada is minus 22° centigrade. So you
1:12:08
will step into Canada. Okay. with bare chest
1:12:13
and then I will buy a jacket there or you'll buy a jacket in India and go
1:12:20
buy in India and go right then which location
1:12:27
yes okay now who said sex choice on the basis of
1:12:34
sexuality who said you.
1:12:40
So, do all LGBTQA people buy sex toys? No. Can a straight person buy sex toy?
1:12:49
Then how are you segmenting on the basis of sexuality?
1:12:54
Then is that like sexuality or is it about the willingness to buy a sex?
1:13:03
Is that a demographic variable? No, that is a psychoraphic and a
1:13:09
behavioral variable. Believe me, you cannot show a single product that you
1:13:14
can segment on the basis of demographics. Yes,
1:13:21
[ __ ] Okay, you can contradict. I'll tell you
1:13:25
what. Let me tell give you an example. Hey,
1:13:29
no. Give me an example. Rolex.
1:13:33
Rolex eight. What is the income? Let me take your example. What is the income
1:13:38
reach? You tell me. Million. No, we will start from a
1:13:45
million only. A million to Elon Musk. Okay.
1:13:51
1 million to Elon Musk. Let's say Okay. Listen
1:13:56
all of you. Do every person with an income more than
1:14:01
a million dollars to Elon Musk will they buy Rolex
1:14:06
then how did you that is what I'm asking because you only said okay you will be
1:14:11
on the basis of income now like all these people okay is this a homogeneous
1:14:16
group you are saying every person from this particular age group to Elon Musk
1:14:22
is going to buy that is what you said do every person buy
1:14:26
how I am a person At least I'm making more than a million dollars. I don't
1:14:30
want to buy Rolex. It's stupid product. Huh?
1:14:37
Luxury watches. I don't want a luxury watch. Why will I buy a luxury watch?
1:14:41
You only said you only said anybody from 1 million to
1:14:47
Elon Musk is going to buy this. Do all people buy this?
1:14:51
No. That is then like most is not homogeneous. You said everybody will buy
1:14:56
it. Do everybody from 1 million to like Elon
1:15:00
Musk is going to buy it? No. Right. Then it is like a homogeneous
1:15:04
group or you have created a smaller heterogeneous group from a larger
1:15:06
heterogeneous group. You get it? Suppose there is a person who's making just
1:15:11
$100,000. Okay. That guy might sell this kidney to
1:15:17
buy this or he might rob somebody to buy this.
1:15:23
Yes or no? Possible. Then how did you create a
1:15:26
homogeneous group? I said 70k. I didn't say
1:15:29
77. Okay. A person 30k can also rob okay and sell your kidney. Okay. Unlike buy
1:15:35
this. Okay. Yes.
1:15:37
As a matter of fact. Yes. Your parents will be buying it for
1:15:49
you. Rolex.
1:15:52
Okay. So that is where you're making a mistake. Don't think on the basis of
1:15:56
income. It is all about the willingness to pay. H
1:15:59
there is no such thing. I will show you. Okay. Just because you
1:16:03
do not know. Yes. In that group will be like a a uh
1:16:09
will be like your customer. How that we will see tomorrow. Bye-bye.

How do products stay relevant over time?
02/10/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Dr. Bhupesh Manoharan
0:18
Now close all of your laptops. But today's session I will not allow
0:23
this session is a very difficult session of all the sessions of this entire
0:28
course. This is the most difficult session. So I want
0:33
most important session as well. I'll not call it as difficult. Okay. Most
0:37
important. Now everyone's presentation and participation I want. Okay. Today
0:43
like anyone with the mobile phone you'll just get out now. If you want to go
0:51
okay even if you want to go I will not mind.
0:57
Oh, last close the laptops. Listen, everybody will listen to me
1:07
today. This topic is the most important topic
1:13
of not this course of this entire program of your enter program. So this
1:20
one and a half hours I want your like full attention.
1:24
So, who are these
1:29
are you planning to come in or not go? Yeah. Yeah. No.
1:38
So, they said like no coffee. Everybody has dumped it with coffee. Now,
1:44
how is it? Keep your mobile phones away. Please
1:49
keep your mobile phones away. Every step we will go in a stepwise
1:55
manner. Okay. We'll go in a step wise manner. Where were you? Morning.
2:00
Morning. Where were you? Okay. Yes.
2:08
Who? That's okay.
2:12
This on you. Okay. Listen. So, what did we see in the morning? We
2:21
said that like boss segmentation cannot be done on the basis of the grouping
2:25
cannot be done on the basis of demographic and geographic variables.
2:28
Right? How do we have to do then? On the basis of psychographic and behavioral
2:34
variables that is exactly how you have to do it. Right? Now I took an example
2:39
suppose like let us say he's launching a beauty cream okay or a face cream. It's
2:45
not about beauty cream face cream product and there were two variables.
2:49
What were the two variables? Usage and user status.
2:59
These were the variables, right? Yes or no?
3:02
This is one variable and this is the second variable. Right? Now, usage had
3:07
how many levels? Three. Heavy, medium, light. Right?
3:15
User status had how many levels? That's okay.
3:19
Advanced and novice. So how many segments were possible?
3:23
Six. Six segments. Right. In this case, six
3:27
segments are possible. Yes or no? You got this. Now if we had four
3:34
variables with the three levels each, how many segments were possible?
3:40
Four variables with the three levels. How many segments
3:44
were possible? 3 to the^ 4 81 segments, right? How many of you are
3:52
not able to get this? How many of you are not able to get
3:56
this? So, four variables with the three levels, then it is 3 to the^ of 4 81
4:02
segments. Yes or no? Want this part? This is what I left you
4:07
today morning. Now, I want all of you to listen. Let us say our boss is planning
4:13
to what's your name? Sorry. Martin.
4:15
Martin. or Martin is like planning to launch a health drink or Martin is
4:20
launching a health drink. And let us say 70 of you, how many of you are in the
4:24
class say 50 of you are in this class. Do you want to be healthy? If he comes
4:29
and asks the question, do you want to be healthy?
4:31
Yes. Yes. Do you want to be healthy?
4:34
Yes. Yes. Do you want to be healthy? Yes. Do
4:37
you want to be healthy? Yes. So if I ask this question to
4:40
everybody, do you want to be healthy? Everybody is going to say yes.
4:47
So can I simply say that like boss his entire target segment his entire all of
4:53
you are his consumers. If he asks this question you know and
4:58
says that boss I'm going to launch a health to all of you it will bombsh
5:04
it will bomb like crazy. It's okay.
5:10
It's okay now. it will go extremely bad. So people will say I want to be healthy.
5:18
I want to be healthy. I want to be healthy. But they will not actually show
5:22
it in their activities, interest, opinions and behaviors. Means their
5:26
psychoraphics and behavior will not reflect that.
5:30
The psychoraphics and behavior will not reflect that. So how are we going to
5:33
capture this? It's okay. It's okay.
5:39
It's okay. It's not his fault, right? It's okay.
5:41
No. Are you done?
5:46
Okay. Close it. Now, so again, I'm repeating. Okay.
5:51
Suppose he wants to launch a health thing. Martin wants to launch a health
5:53
drink. If he simply goes and asks boss, keep the phone away.
5:58
Keep the phone away. I'm saying if you are important call,
6:03
you go out and take it. No.
6:11
Now listen, if you look at it, okay? So
6:18
if I simply come and ask, okay, what do you want to be healthy? Do you want to
6:22
be healthy? Do you want to be healthy? Everybody's going to say yes, I want to
6:25
be healthy. Okay, can I segment that everybody is my
6:29
segment? You ask everybody in the world, okay, then I want to be healthy.
6:34
Nobody somebody who says I want to be unhealthy should be a insane person
6:38
right I cannot segment like that so what I will do is I will try to segment on
6:45
the basis of individuals activities interest opinions and behavior mean
6:50
psychoraphics and behavioral variables how instead of that let us say what will
6:55
be the activities of a healthy person first I'm going to ask okay boss your
7:00
willingness to exercise every day let me Ask this your willingness to
7:07
exercise or gym every day.
7:15
Some might say that like boss I will gym all the seven days a week. Some will say
7:20
that like boss I will gym two two weeks or three two three times a week. Some
7:25
will say I will go to gym like once in like 2 weeks. Yes or no? Okay. So this
7:29
can be high, medium or low. Yes or no? Willingness to exercise every
7:35
day can be high, medium, low. Similarly, there is one variable. Willingness to
7:40
eat junk food every day. For some individuals, they
7:53
might be eating junk food every day. Some individuals will say I will eat
7:57
once in 2 days. Some individuals say once in a week I will try to eat high,
8:01
medium low. Yes or no? Yes. Now the next one I I can ask was time spent indoors.
8:10
Time spent inside the home. Say for example, she might be spending
8:15
16 hours inside the home. He might spend some 8 9 hours inside the home. He might
8:20
spend only four five hours inside the home. So high, medium, low there also.
8:24
Yes. that will us to play
8:33
outdoor games. This can be high, medium, low. Somebody
8:40
may be very sporty, somebody might not be, somebody Yes. So, so how do you get
8:45
this variable? No, just logic. Okay. But how do you
8:48
actually get these variables that will come true consumer behavior? Now like
8:51
I'm just saying for typically healthy person these are the activities a
8:55
healthy person or unhealthy person will involve it. It's coming from logic. Now
8:58
how many variables are there? So variables how many levels are there
9:03
for the variables? Three. How many segments are possible?
9:07
81. 3 to the^ of 4 81 segments are possible. Right?
9:11
In this entire class how many people are there?
9:14
50 people. So for 50 people if I come up with 81 segments is that even making
9:20
sense. Isn't it stupid?
9:22
Yes. That's stupid right? For 50 people I am
9:26
coming up with 81 segments. What are the 81 segments? High willingness to
9:31
exercise, high willingness to eat junk food, high time spent indoors is
9:36
extremely high and high will this is one segment. High medium high high that
9:41
might be the second segment. So I will have 81 signals. Does that even make
9:46
sense? All right. How many segments will our Martin want? Say possibly three
9:52
segments or four segments.
9:55
Right? So that he can manage that. Yes or no?
10:00
So he can manage that. He needs say three or four segments. Let's say three
10:04
segments are Martin blocks. 81 segments are possible. Now how do I create three
10:10
segments? Yes. Just the three segments are needed. How do I create these three
10:14
signals? So this is where a tool called as cluster analysis will come and help
10:21
us. You will learn this tool in the next course only. Okay. But it's okay. How
10:26
what is the logic of it? Let us try to understand all of you. All of you rather
10:30
than writing listen to me. This is absolutely important. All other classes
10:33
are not this haha. I want all of you to listen.
10:38
So how how does this tool work? Okay. How does this tool work? Let us try to
10:42
understand this. This will require some 15 minutes of full concentration. If you
10:46
understand then you have got it. So listen now let us say how many variables
10:51
are there in this problem of how many variables are here?
10:55
2 1 2 if I am going to plot this. I'm going to
11:01
draw a graph for this. Okay. What will be these axis? If I have to
11:07
plot this, what will be the axis? The variables will be the access. The
11:12
variables will be the access. Right? Means this is the usage axis.
11:16
This is the user status axis. If I have to plot it, it will be low,
11:25
medium, high. This is no and advanced. Yes.
11:31
Suppose our say Martin has answered as high, advanced. How will you just mark
11:37
Martin here? High and advance here is where Martin
11:41
will sit. Yes or no? Yes.
11:44
Okay. How many variables were there here?
11:47
Two. Two variables. So what is the number of
11:50
axis here? Two axis. Right. This is one axis. This
11:54
is another axis. For two variables, how many axis were there? Two axis.
12:00
How many variables are here? Four variables. So how many axis will be
12:04
there? Four axis. Are you able to get it? If here it will be four axis.
12:12
Let me draw it here properly. So four variables how many axis will be
12:18
there is there will be four axis. I cannot even represent four axis in a two
12:24
dimensional plane. Yes or no? But I'm just drawing four axis will be there.
12:28
Are you able to get this logic? Are you able to get this logic? Yes or no?
12:33
Please. Anybody has not got this? Please tell me. Everybody has not got this
12:38
please tell me. Huh? So the thing is that was how many variables were there
12:44
here? Was two variables. So it became two axis usage and user status. How many
12:50
variables are here? So that is why these are the four axis. Now instead of listen
12:56
instead of usage and user status let me call this axis as xaxis and yaxis. Okay.
13:04
Can I do that? Then what will be this point? This point
13:09
will be on X1. This is the first person. So X1, Y1. That's all. This person, this
13:17
is the first person. So he is X1, Y1. Suppose there is a second person. What
13:22
will be the second person? X2.
13:24
X2, Y2. How many people are we collecting the data from?
13:29
50. So what will be the 50th person? X50 comma Y50. Are you with me here? Any
13:38
questions here? Till here, please tell me. Any questions till here? Not this
13:43
part. Similarly, in in this case, okay, here if you look at these four things,
13:50
okay, these four things. Okay, what are the axises here? Let us call this as X,
13:56
Y, Z and A. Let us call them. Listen, listen. This is X Y Z. Instead of
14:02
writing fully willing us to exercise, willing us to eat junk food, willingness
14:07
time spent, I'm just writing this as X Y is it a yes or no? Are you are you with
14:16
me here? Is everybody with me? Yes.
14:19
Anyone are you here? Yes. X Y Z. Now let us say
14:25
for every question if suppose what's your name?
14:29
Dan. If Brandon will be answering like this, listen, Brandon is going to answer
14:33
like this. This is what is Brandon's answer. If I
14:38
float the survey to Brandon, Brandon will answer like this. Okay. Now, what
14:43
are your names? Okay. What's your name? Huh?
14:48
Is going to answer like this. Brandon is answering like this. Mori is answering.
14:54
This is what is Mory's answer. Okay. What's your name?
15:00
Oh, that's very difficult pronounce. Huh?
15:05
That is far more difficult. Anybody with the easy name.
15:08
Julian. Okay. For me to pronounce otherwise you keep
15:12
the name tax. Okay. Julian is going to answer like this. Listen. Julian is
15:18
giving an answer like this. Okay. This is how Julian is
15:25
marking. I because every person is going to mark all the four answers. All the
15:30
four answers. Yes or no? Yes.
15:33
Right. Now tell me who are the closest to each other?
15:38
Who are the closest to each other on the basis of this?
15:42
So the ticks and the crosses. Yes. The ticks and the crosses are like a Mario
15:49
and like a sorry what's your name? Brandon. Marian. How did you say Mario
15:53
and Brandon are closest to each other? So they have more
15:56
they have more in common actually. Do you know how you
16:00
said that? Do you know how you said? Okay. Do you know how you said that?
16:05
I'll tell you. I'll listen. Now if I have to represent Mary here in this axis
16:13
mor is the first person who has answered.
16:19
Okay. What will be M's point? X1. Listen all of you. X1
16:26
Y1 Z1 Z1 A1. This will be M's point. Are you
16:31
able to get to this? Please tell me. Are you able to follow this?
16:36
The only question that I have is why the levels are in the x-axis in this case,
16:40
but in the other case the levels are anywhere in the graphic.
16:46
No, the levels are everywhere. Levels are also here. Low, medium, height here,
16:50
also low, medium, height. You know, low, medium, high, low, medium, high. That is
16:54
exactly how it is. Got it? Okay. So, what will be M's point?
17:00
X1, Y1, Z1, A1. Right? What will be Julian's point?
17:06
X2 X2 Y2 Z2 A2. Then what will be Brandon's point? So,
17:15
Brandon's point is somewhere here. And it is a fourdimensional plane. It is a
17:19
four dimensional plane. It can be anywhere. Right? Diamond's point is X3
17:23
Y3 Z3 A3. If suppose okay our boy is the 750th person. What will be his point?
17:33
X50 Y50 Z50 A50. Are you able to get to this?
17:37
But why? One question. Why? But it goes further than 50 and we have more
17:42
segmentations than 50 you know. Yeah. We are collecting the data only
17:45
from 50 people. You miss repeat.
17:49
Yeah. We will see. Okay. Huh?
17:52
50 for a second. No, 50 people are here. I'm collecting
17:55
from 50 people. If I'm collecting from 2,000 people,
17:59
what will be that point? 200,000
18:00
X 2000 Y 2000 Z 2000 A 2000. Are you with me?
18:05
Yes. Do you know how like a Brandon and Mi how did you say suppose this is
18:12
Mi's point, Brandon's point and this is Julian's point. Okay. Do you know how
18:17
actually you people said okay Maui and Brandon are closest to each other? Do
18:21
you know actually how you said you actually calculated the distance between
18:26
these three? You mentally what you did was actually
18:31
you calculated this distance this distance and this distance and you said
18:36
that these two points are the closest. That is exactly how you said in mind
18:41
without knowing that you have calculated because you said
18:47
this this this are closest and this is the only point we are differing. You
18:52
said this because you actually mentally calculated.
18:57
Okay. Now our mind calculates without even knowing that we are calculating. Do
19:01
you know how this is calculated? This is calculated using theian distance
19:06
formula. No, it's not the python formula. It's
19:09
the ukidian distance formula. Okay, do you know how the uklidian distance
19:13
formula is calculated? You want to know? I will write it. Okay, but you need not
19:17
do it. The tool will do it for you. Okay, so don't bother. People before
19:21
you, your ancestors have made it simple for you. Okay, so but actually how is
19:26
this calculated is this distance is calculated using this formula. roo<unk>
19:31
of x1 - x2 the whole square + y1 - y2 the
19:37
whole square + z1 - z2 the whole square + a1 - a2 the whole square this is how
19:45
this distance is calculated similarly this distance is calculated by x1 - x3
19:51
the whole square + y1 - y3 the whole square and this distance is calculated
19:55
x2 - xt you need not bother about it the tool will do this for you okay the tool
20:00
I will do this for you. Are you able to get the logic of it? That is the most
20:04
important thing. How many of you have lost me here?
20:08
Are you all with me? Are you all with me so far? Yes, boss. What is your
20:12
question? I was going to ask how does this relate
20:15
to going to see? Okay, listen. Now,
20:20
now we get this particular thing. Now, let
20:24
let us see. I will draw the same thing here. Okay, let me draw this here. Okay.
20:35
X Y Z A Right. XY Z A. Now, how many people have
20:42
you collected this data from? 50 people. Okay. The center class is 50
20:47
people. Yes. Um with the
20:51
line that's a Why isn't it like straight down?
20:53
No, it's okay. I just do it because it's a fourdimensional plane. You cannot even
20:56
draw a four dimensional plane. Right? That is why. Okay. So that is just a
21:02
drawn. Okay. Now how many people have you collected the points from? How many
21:06
people you have collected data from? 50. So how many points will be there
21:11
here? 50. Are you able to get it? So there
21:14
will be 50 points here. So what happens if there's more?
21:22
That's okay. Then it will be 2,000 points. Suppose let me ask you a
21:25
question. Okay, let anybody try to answer this. I am collecting the data on
21:31
20 variables. 20 variables, how many axis will be there?
21:35
20. 20 axis. I'm collecting the data on 20
21:39
variables and from 5,000 people. How many axis will be there? How many points
21:45
will be there? 5,000.
21:48
Wait, not everybody is not following. Okay, those people who I am collecting
21:52
the data on 20 variables from 5,000 people. Okay, how will this axis look
21:59
like? 20 axis and 5,000 points will be there.
22:05
Are you following? Why?
22:13
That is okay. That is an exception. Okay. But let's say 5,000 points
22:17
logically. Are you able to get to this please? Are you following or not
22:22
following? Sorry, ma'am. Okay. Keep the phone away. Keep the
22:26
phone away. Okay. So, are you able to get this logic?
22:31
Yes. Now, so how many points are going to be here?
22:38
How many points are going to be here? 50 points are going to be there. What will
22:42
be the first point? What will be the first point? X1 Y1 Z1
22:48
A1 What will be the 50th point? X50 Y50 Z50 A50 Got it? Now, how many
23:02
clusters did our boy want? How many clusters did our boy want?
23:07
Three clusters. Three clusters. Right. So now what he's
23:11
going to do is he's going to tell this tool boss I need three clusters.
23:18
He's going to tell this entire tool that I need three clusters. Now as soon as
23:22
you tell the tool that like I need three clusters. Then here you said who's the
23:28
closest to each other? What did you say? Brandon and were the closest to each
23:32
other. Right? when they are closest to each other then they will have the same
23:36
problem because they when they are closest to
23:40
each other they will also have the same problem right so he is also high
23:43
willingness to exercise high willingness to exercise okay medium willingness to
23:48
eat junk medium willingness to eat junk high willingness high time spent indoors
23:53
high time spent indoors high like willingness to play outside high
23:57
willingness to play outside so they also have a common
24:01
problem Because they are the clo the more closest then like you'll have a
24:06
common problem. Yes or no? Are you with me?
24:11
Are you with me? So now what will the tool do is listen. Listen all of you.
24:16
What will the tool do is the tool will go and check
24:22
all the pairs of points. How many points are here?
24:26
50 points. So how many pairs of points are there?
24:33
How many pairs of points are there? How many pairs of points are there?
24:42
Okay. How many points of pairs of points are there? It will be 50 into 49 by 2.
24:48
These many points will be there. This many pairs of points are there. How? Let
24:53
me show you. How many points are there here? So how
24:59
many pairs of coins are there? One,
25:04
this is one pair. This is two pair.
25:07
Third pair, fourth, fifth
25:11
and sixth. So how did you calculate 4 into 3 by 2 means m into n - 1 by 2.
25:20
This is how this is calculated. Are you able to get it? So how many pairs of
25:26
points will be here? So I'm telling you listen you're
25:32
calculating the number of points I do not want that. So 40 50 into 49 by 2.
25:37
Yes. If you go and calculate the distance between all the pairs of
25:42
points. Means folks please please please listen. You calculate the distance
25:48
between every pair of point and what it will do is it will actually it go and
25:55
say see this is the closest to pair. It will combine these two and it will
26:01
combine both of this. Then the points will vanish and there will be one X that
26:06
will take its position. The cent will take its position. Two points which are
26:10
the closest will combine into one cluster and one it will become one
26:15
point. Okay. How many points will be left on the
26:19
board? Now two points are clumped into one point.
26:23
So how many points will be left on the board?
26:25
49 points because there were 50 points we began with. two come and it became
26:31
49. Are you able to get it? Yes. Now again it will go. Now how many
26:38
pairs of points will be there? 49 into 48 by2. Okay. Again it will do
26:44
this and it will club the next closest points. Let us say these two points are
26:49
closest. This will be clubed and how many points will be there now?
26:54
48. 48 then 47 46 45 44. Okay, if you leave
27:00
it, it will give you one cluster. If you leave it, okay, without stopping, it
27:06
will give you one cluster. Are you able to get it? But do we want
27:10
one cluster? No. Right. How many clusters we want?
27:14
We want three clusters. So what we will do is we have asked the tool was give me
27:21
three clusters. Okay? We have asked the tool give me three clusters, right?
27:27
So what it will do is it will go and combine this in such a way that this
27:33
will become one cluster. This will become the second cluster and this will
27:38
become a third cluster. Okay. Now how does it combine? That logic alone you
27:43
have to know. Okay. That logic alone you have to know. Listen. Listen. Now let us
27:48
say our band and Mari right uh Brandon Mari
27:54
and I are standing here all the three of us are there right who are the closest
28:00
and now if both of them are combined let us say this pen is the one that is
28:05
combining then both is the pen a representation of like a Brandon and
28:10
Mori yes but is the pen Brandon no is the pen
28:16
pen Mori Oh, but it is a representation of both. Yes. Now, if suppose
28:24
all the three of us are combined, where will the pen now be? The pen will be
28:27
somewhere in the middle. Is the pen me? Is it branded? Is it? But it is a
28:34
representation of all the three of us. So now like when three points,
28:41
when three points are going to be combined, listen all of you.
28:45
When these two points are combining, so what happens? There will be one X cent,
28:50
right? Yes or no?
28:53
Is this X a representation of point A, B, C?
28:57
Is a representation of point A, A and B? But is it A?
29:02
Is it B? So there is some mistake there, right?
29:05
There is an error there in this point. It is a representation that it is not
29:10
the actual point, right? So there is an error. What is the error? This distance
29:15
plus this distance is the error. Now if all the three points are clumped, where
29:21
will be the X be in the middle? What is the error? Now
29:28
this distance plus this distance plus this distance, right?
29:32
So when three points got added, did the error increase?
29:37
But three points got added, right? From two, we became three.
29:41
So it will clump in such a way that the area within the group is minimal and the
29:49
distance between in the groups are maximum. That is the logic in which it
29:54
clocks. Okay, it will club. See for example here
29:58
also these points will club. There will be one x x right there will be xxx here
30:06
for each of the groups. Then because we needed we have three clusters right? We
30:10
ask three clusters. So it get requests this the logic in which it collapses the
30:16
error within the group the error inside the group is minimal
30:21
and the distance between these points are the maximum that is the foundation
30:25
on which the cluster forms. Okay are you able to are you with me?
30:31
How many of you have lost me? Please tell me how many of you have lost me.
30:38
Now see this we we we asked for three clusters like
30:43
this between we asked for three clusters right then the three clusters are
30:47
forming one one cent will form for all the clusters. Now the error should be
30:54
minimal within the group and these central should be very very far apart
30:59
means all the people who are similar should go to one group all the people
31:04
who are different should be pulled into different groups. Are you that is the
31:08
logic in which it forms. Are you able to get it? Now the math is done. That's
31:13
all. This is the only math part. Are you able to get the logic? Now how many
31:18
clusters have we formed? three clusters.
31:23
There's three clusters. So let us say some 10 15 people or 10 people went
31:32
here. Okay. This group has say 22 people.
31:38
Okay. This group has say eight people. 10 or let's let me put it in this way.
31:43
Okay. 15 people went here. Say 10 to 17 people went here and say
31:49
eight people went here. Let us say now what do I do with this?
31:57
Wake up. Then you keep your hand like that. Then
32:01
you going to sleep only. So 50 27 and 8. So all the 50 people
32:07
went into three groups. And what do you do with this? I do not know anything. I
32:13
do not know anything. just it's 15 people say 22 people 2 22 people or 27
32:19
people and eight people went like this now how do I use this
32:25
okay how do I use this so far what we have done what we have said you can
32:30
segment only on the basis of psychoraphics and behavior right and you
32:35
cannot use demographics that is what I've been saying that's wrong
32:42
you can use demographics But after grouping for maming you have
32:48
to use only demographics. Okay. So for grouping you can never group somebody on
32:53
the basis of demographics. Now what you will do is
32:58
now only demographics comes. So basically sorry if I interrupt but
33:02
basically do is you then go after like likes and those things
33:05
then like you add the demographics with that and then
33:08
then you specify again then you use the demographics. You just
33:12
take people to make it easier to take people out of a pond. You make a pawn a
33:17
big pond and then you take them out and then you make a smaller pond and again
33:20
and again and again. Yes.
33:22
Okay. Now listen if I have to describe you
33:27
I can I describe you by looking at you. Can I just describe him? Willingness to
33:30
exercise is high. Okay. Willingness to eat junk food. I cannot. I can describe
33:35
you by saying that you are a 20 year old male. Okay. So possibly like a um
33:42
European and okay Christian and okay uh Spanish speaker that is how I can
33:50
describe you. I cannot describe you on the basis of demographics and and
33:53
psychographics. The dem the description part that should be done only on the
33:58
basis of demographics. So what you do is when you're collecting the data itself
34:04
you will also collect listen you will also collect the other data. What is the
34:09
age? What is the gender? What is the income?
34:16
You collect it using survey that you'll learn later. We'll collect it using
34:20
surveys. At the time we collect this, right? And what is their education? This
34:24
also we will collect. Now what you will do is now you know
34:30
there are 15 people here, right? There are 15 people here. Now you will know
34:34
okay what is the demographics of this group. Okay. So how
34:39
you do? You now look at what is the lowest age to the highest age. What is
34:46
the lowest? So suppose this is 22 to 36 years old.
34:52
You're applying the demographics. Now this group 22 to 36 years old
34:57
predominantly male say 13 out of 15 people were male here.
35:06
Okay. Salary of more than $10,000
35:11
per month. Salary of more than $10,000 per month.
35:17
College educated And you will also add one or two open
35:27
behavioral variables which behavior you can observe goes to gym
35:32
every day doesn't eat junk food.
35:41
So some behavioral variables and a lot of demographic variables we will apply
35:46
come to this particular group. Okay. In this group possibly it is
35:54
21 to 35 years old both male and female
36:04
salary of say $8,000 to $1,000 per month.
36:11
school and college educated goes to gym
36:21
three times a week
36:26
and then like goes to eats junk three times a week.
36:39
Yes. how I have now applied this. Yes, you choose what's most dominant in the
36:46
Yes, in the variables. Yes, that you choose with the most dominant. You also
36:51
look at the things that you can observe openly. Now, what do you do here? Here
36:55
also it applied say 20 to 36 years old predominantly male here as well
37:08
salary of less than $6,000 per month school educated
37:19
go must uh no doesn't go to the gym doesn't go to the gym at all
37:27
eats junk food every day. Yes. Now what did I do is I have applied
37:37
this particular demographic and behavioral variables. On the basis of
37:41
this what I will do is okay now listen to to 36 years old predominantly male
37:47
more than $10,000 college educated goes to gym every day doesn't eat gym junk
37:52
food at all. Possibly this group is a gym freak.
37:57
I will name this group gym freak. This is a gym freak group.
38:02
21 to 35 years old both male and female 8,000 to 12,000 college and school
38:06
educated goes to gym three times a day three times a week eats junk food also
38:11
three times a week possibly this is the normal Nancy or the normal
38:18
normal normal Nancy or the normal this one 20 to 36 years old
38:31
predominantly less than the salvi school educator does not go to the gym at all.
38:36
Eats junk food every day. Possibly this is a couch potato
38:48
couch potato. Now what I have done is I have come and profiled this particular
38:55
group. Then only you get a segment. Are you able to get it? Then only you get a
39:00
segment. Now let me ask a question. In this class, in this class, who's the gym
39:05
freak in the class? Who do you think is the gym freak in the class?
39:09
Give me a name. Huh? Who?
39:12
And okay. And how did you say that he's the gym freak? So far, you have profiled
39:17
him as the gym freak. You have profile profiled him because this guy goes to
39:23
gym every day. Okay. And this is how a gym freak will look like.
39:28
Are you able to get it? Now, who's the normal Nancy of the class or normal
39:32
Narin of the class or Nan of the class? Who's the normal Nancy?
39:35
Nan. Ah, you are the normal Nan. Okay. So,
39:41
normal Nan. Okay. This guy is not like a you know how your profile and don't even
39:48
talk about the couch potato. I am the couch potato. Biggest couch potato of
39:51
this entire class. Okay. Because I do not like exercise properly. Okay. I eat
39:56
junk almost every day. Okay. or individ.
40:00
Now this is exactly how you profile. Now you have got three segments.
40:07
Now you have got three segments. Yes or no?
40:10
Yes. Okay. Now in this segment in this
40:14
segment whoever is closest to this particular cent this is what is the
40:20
center the midpoint right? That person is what is called as the ICP. This is
40:26
what is the ideal customer persona. The person is suppose this person will
40:33
be this will be this. Okay. I will be this.
40:38
Okay. This is what is the IC or the ideal customer persona.
40:49
Ideal customer persona. Every group will have one one ideal customer persona. Are
40:55
you able to get this logic folks? Are you able to get this logic? That's all
41:00
segmentation is done. Okay, this is the one difficult part of
41:04
this course. Okay, but this is the most important part of this course. How many
41:09
of you completely got it? Entire thing raise your hands. How many of you
41:14
completely got it? How many of you have some problems still? Please tell me.
41:18
It's okay. How many of you still like some things? Okay, let us take a 10
41:22
minutes break. Okay, let's take a 10 minutes break. All of you who have
41:26
problems, come to me. I'll explain it to you again. Okay, come to me.
41:31
Which one you did not get it? The cluster is this group.
41:44
The group is what is the cluster? Yeah. And there are three because
41:47
no because we asked three. We asked for three clusters. People ask for
41:56
which is the distance that is the distance between this part.
42:01
This distance this distance how do you calculate this distance using this
42:05
formula? Don't bother about it. The tool will do it for you. Okay.
42:11
Cost analysis that you learn next time. Okay. Cost analysis. You will learn
42:16
that. Okay. All of this. How do you get it? We will then do the cost analysis.
42:20
If there are like more than four levels like 10 or 20 which levels
42:24
like you can do four levels means four and
42:28
and four four power four that many sements will be formed.
42:33
If it's 10 then it's going to be 10 to the^ of four
42:38
that's okay but you not bother about it even will do it for you.
42:42
So you were saying analysis we're doing this cluster. So
42:48
these are two points combined into one. How do you decide the points of
42:51
advantages? Oh, it's okay. That two will take care
42:53
of it. You give three clusters or four number of this after this you have
43:00
segmentation. You have segmentation.
43:03
Yes. You said
43:11
yes. Everyone can
43:20
choose one. Okay.
43:25
We first
43:29
behavior and then
43:34
because we must do not
43:53
so cuz when you were See here the same if you calculate this
44:01
distance this distance this distance this distance this distance and
44:04
whichever is the closest okay whichever is the closest it will
44:08
come together don't use that marker no no no use this marker use a different
44:15
marker this one just
44:26
like overlapping. No, it's okay. Which one is overlapping
44:30
you like the lines here? But like dimensional
44:38
dimension. It is not about this dimensional plane. I cannot even draw
44:44
that. All these points are somewhere and this will be group second group. Third
44:49
group the groups will not overlap. Okay. But go listen to the video if you
44:54
still have a problem. Um uh from Spanish
45:20
don't understand I know I know like see the thing is I
45:27
can teach a lot of Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
46:02
Yes. Okay. Together. Yes. It will bring them
46:10
together. Then what you do? You apply the demographics to name the group.
46:18
It is age. All the people, gender, all these things. You apply it on the group
46:22
made. Now the group has been formed because the group is formed on the basis
46:25
of activities. Then if you apply the demographics to
46:30
it's first
46:37
and then that's
46:41
you will not make mistake what you doing is you segment it on the basis of age
46:45
and then you looking for likes not understand the logic Yeah.
47:12
Heat. Heat.
47:28
Heat. Heat. Heat.
47:49
Heat. Heat. ICP
48:22
system. Heat. Heat.
48:41
Heat. Heat. Yeah.
48:55
Heat. Heat.
49:10
Heat. Okay.
49:33
That's okay. That's okay. Heat.
49:54
Heat. Thanks.
50:17
Yes. No, I will write it now. Okay.
50:40
I am scared about section A. Okay. That is the one section which doesn't follow
50:44
at all. Okay. Section one. Section one. Section one never opens it.
50:52
Much better. Okay. Heat. Heat.
51:08
Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat.
51:35
All of you are useless fellows. Okay, sit down.
51:45
Okay, shall I run this part? What is this? Stupid mic is working or
52:14
not working. Okay,
52:20
folks. I cannot teach this even more simpler. I do not know how to teach even
52:25
more simpler than this. I don't imagine this.
52:27
Huh? That's okay. That's okay. But like are you able to follow that is the most
52:33
important thing? Go sit quickly.
53:11
Now how do we do this segmentation? Okay.
53:15
Now I will exp see I will give now step-wise guide for doing this. Okay.
53:20
What did we do? First things how the entire process of segmentation. How did
53:25
we do? First we group them, right? First we group people. How do we group people?
53:31
Using psychoraphics and behavior, right? The grouping. Okay. That process is
53:36
called as clustering. The grouping process is called as
53:41
clustering. Okay. Now listen, listen all of you. The
53:47
clustering is nothing but the grouping process. How did you group?
53:53
How did you group? You group on the basis of
53:57
psychoraphics and behavioral variables. We use the psychoraphics
54:04
and behavioral variables to group.
54:09
So what came out of this? What came out of this? What came out of this is what
54:14
is called as a cluster. Okay. What came what comes out of this
54:21
is a cluster. What comes out of this is a cluster.
54:28
Okay. But with the cluster can we do anything? A group of people. So 15
54:32
people are here, seven people are there, 20 27 people are there. But what do I do
54:37
with that? I have to name the group, right? How do I name or how do I
54:41
describe the group? The description can be done only through demographics. Yes,
54:46
the class string plus the naming part. Okay, that is what is called as
54:52
profiling. Clustering plus profiling. Profiling is what is the naming part?
54:59
Profiling is what is called as the naming part.
55:09
How do you name them on the basis of what? Demographics are
55:17
one or two behavioral variables. Demographics plus one or two behavioral
55:23
variables. These are the open behavioral variables.
55:28
What is the meaning of open behavioral variables? Some some behavior I can see
55:32
he's going to the gym every day. He's eating healthy food or protein food and
55:37
you're seeing that right openly. That is why like you said he is a gym freak.
55:41
Okay. So the open behavioral variables. Okay. So what will this give you? This
55:50
profiling gave you something called as a cluster descriptor.
56:00
So a cluster plus a cluster descriptor the two together is what is called as a
56:08
segment. A cluster plus a cluster descriptor.
56:12
This is what is called as a segment. And this entire process is called as
56:18
segmentation. This entire process is what is called a
56:23
segmentation. Are you able to get it? So segmentation is this particular process.
56:32
Okay. And in the segment in the segment suppose there's a group coming up right.
56:36
In the segment, the typical member of the segment, the typical cent of the
56:41
segment, that is what we call as the ICP.
56:46
This one is called as the ICP, ideal customer persona or the ideal consumer
56:53
persona. So this entire process is what is
56:59
segmentation. Are you following? How many of you got
57:04
this? sit down. Okay. So, segmentation is
57:09
nothing but create a homogeneous group. Now, how is
57:14
this a homogeneous group? Now, all the people who have the same likes,
57:18
dislikes, preferences, activities have gone inside. So, you are grouping on the
57:22
basis of activities, interest, opinions and preferences. And now like you are
57:26
naming and that is why if you see demographics will overlap.
57:32
Demographics will overlap. That is okay. But you will know who's the gym freak.
57:37
You know who's the normal nar or normal. You know who is the couch potato?
57:44
Are you able to get it? Are you able to get this?
57:48
Now comes my important question. So who should our
57:54
huh? Martin. Okay. Where should our M now
57:58
like go and target? Who should he choose? He got three groups, right? He
58:04
can sell the help bring to any of the groups. Yes or no? Who should he choose?
58:10
That is what is targeting. That is what is targeting. So far
58:15
whatever you had said adult diapers versus like children diaper that is
58:20
targeting that is not segmentation. In the segmentation we did possibly one
58:25
group will come as children's group 0 to 3 years of age cannot control their
58:30
urinary bladder. Okay. Both male and female. Okay. So that will be a child
58:36
group 60 to 75 years old. They cannot control their urinary bladder. Okay.
58:42
Both male and female. That will be an adult group. Are you able to get it? Now
58:46
which is the group that you're going to choose? That is what is called the
58:50
targeting. Are you able to get it? Are you able to
58:54
get this? Yes. So you might have already addressed
58:57
this. But so I understood the clustering for the naming. I see like how it works
59:03
but I don't exactly see the point. Why do we have to name like when like let's
59:08
say we've clustered why can't we just target our marketing based on the
59:12
cluster? Because how do I describe you? How can I
59:14
describe you? How do you need to describe me? No
59:16
because like how will you tell to a saleserson? So tomorrowes
59:22
sales of course now like if I have to like go and like any now like let me ask
59:28
a simple question boss you get up now just by looking at this audience
59:34
tell me who are all do you think is the uh gym freaks in this class and you can
59:41
say anyone okay just by looking at these people tell me who are all the gym
59:44
freaks. Yeah. Here. Just raise your hands.
59:47
Yeah. So, one. Okay.
59:49
Two. Then
59:51
three. Okay. Hey, don't raise also. Okay. Fine.
59:58
In the back. Who?
1:00:00
You. Okay. Raise. Ra raise your hand. And then all of you get up. Get up and
1:00:05
start. You can choose girls as well.
1:00:12
Yes. Yeah.
1:00:17
Never know who. Okay, fine.
1:00:18
That's enough. That's enough.
1:00:20
Now these people is what he thinks is the
1:00:26
gym freaks. Why? Because he he knows how the gym freak look like. Okay, that's
1:00:33
okay. Sit down. Sit down. Thank you so much.
1:00:36
Okay, so he he thinks Listen, that's okay for him.
1:00:42
He thinks that these people are the gym freaks. Why? Because he has certain
1:00:48
things. He has a certain profile in mind. How did the profile come? That
1:00:52
came because of demographics. It did not come because of psychographics. Possibly
1:00:57
might not even like exercise. Okay. But like he might look like he's a person
1:01:01
who exercising just as an example. Are you going to get
1:01:06
it? So that is what he did. He did the profiling. He did the profiling. Okay.
1:01:12
So plus string plus profiling will give you a segment.
1:01:17
Now the ideal customer persona for the segment will be our boy. He will be or
1:01:24
all of you will want to look like him or move close to him in his in your body
1:01:29
shape. That's exactly possible. This is what is my ideal. Everybody would want
1:01:32
to like move close to his body standards. Are you able to get it?
1:01:38
Are you shut up? Okay. Are you able to follow?
1:01:43
Yes. Now tell
1:01:46
which is the group what you are going to go under target. What is your favorable
1:01:51
group? Now tell me. Okay. So there are 15
1:01:56
people in gym freak, 37 people in normal,
1:02:00
eight people in like couch potato in this class. Now if you have to sell, who
1:02:05
will you choose? The biggest.
1:02:09
So you are going to say I'm going to go with the normal Nancy. That is one
1:02:14
advice saying I want all of you to listen. He said I'm going to go with the
1:02:18
biggest group. The biggest group he chose that on the basis of something
1:02:22
called as a sales potential because this is the largest group. So I'm going with
1:02:27
this. Yes. That is what he said because this has the highest sales potential.
1:02:34
Yes or no? This group has the highest sales potential. Yes.
1:02:41
Okay. Great. Now I will give you a different situation. So
1:02:47
this group you're making the product okay for 10 g.
1:02:56
But this group pays again 150 g for that.
1:03:04
This group you're again making a product for 10 g but this group pays 40 g for
1:03:09
this. This group you are making the product
1:03:13
again for 10 g but this group is willing to pay 80 g
1:03:19
which is the group you will be choosing freak. Why? Because even though the
1:03:25
numbers is higher here the profit potential is higher. Profit per unit is
1:03:31
much much higher. So that is the second criteria you might choose.
1:03:36
One is the sales potential. The second can be the profit potential.
1:03:42
You can use both. I'm just telling example sales potential. Second one is
1:03:46
profit potential. Now boss let me give a different add another criterion. Okay.
1:03:52
There are 15 competitors in this market.
1:04:00
They're already selling a different product. Same similar product. There are
1:04:04
seven competitors in this market. There is no competitor in this market.
1:04:15
Which one you choose? Couch potatoes. Now or like he chose it
1:04:21
on the basis of whether there is a unique need.
1:04:27
So it is a combination of all the three. Okay. Not just 1 2 3. You use a
1:04:33
combination of whether it is a sales potential or a profit potential or a
1:04:37
unique. You look at all these three things and then choose a segment. Not
1:04:41
only that now like you have done a segment whatever suppose you say I'm
1:04:47
going to go with the couch potato market. Okay. I'm going to go to the
1:04:51
couch potato market. He will also now come and do
1:04:57
a port five forces analysis and a SWAT analysis
1:05:07
and the entire stakeholder analysis. Why? Now only he has identified who is
1:05:16
his consumer and what is the consumer's problem. Okay. Now again you will do
1:05:22
this analysis okay and you will do this internal external check before you move
1:05:28
forward. This is how you do a targeting a targeting. So don't think the
1:05:33
stakeholder analysis goes away. Okay. First step is segmentation. From
1:05:38
segmentation only you'll identify who's the consumer for the consumer. What is
1:05:43
the need? Then you restart the process. It's iterative process. So what are the
1:05:47
consumers need? What is the stakeholder analysis?
1:05:51
Okay. And this is how you will choose a particular consumer. This is how you
1:05:58
choose a particular consumer. Are you able to get it? You choose a you choose
1:06:02
a particular segment on the basis of this internal external analysis. This is
1:06:08
the external aspect. This is the internal aspect and you will do this
1:06:13
analysis and you will choose a group. This is what is targeting
1:06:19
and in targeting only you said that was what is the time
1:06:27
s all these nonsense comes because of
1:06:32
targeting this is how it should be calculated but whatever you are
1:06:35
calculating some number stupid number you put in your PPT and so this is my
1:06:40
fan this is my s this is my song it comes because of is
1:06:46
and how do you actually calculate the time samp
1:06:51
again you'll see in the next course only because it is again mathematical
1:06:56
before like understanding consumer behavior you do not know how to
1:06:59
calculate transform all of you whatever like you have calculated that is
1:07:02
complete nonsense what is tan sansome total addressable
1:07:07
market serviceable addressable market serviceable obtainable market don't even
1:07:12
bother about it now Suppose
1:07:16
our boy is the CEO of unilver. Okay, you know unilver right or PNG.
1:07:23
Now which is a segment that he can choose?
1:07:27
He can at the same time launch three products for these three groups.
1:07:32
Yes or no? Because if you have that much space,
1:07:39
okay, you can launch three products, three brands at the same time.
1:07:43
But our boy is a new guy. He does not have that much money. He has to raise
1:07:48
money. He can fight it out. So what should our boy do in such a case?
1:07:54
He will focus on one group first. First our boy will start with this group.
1:07:59
Suppose our boy is starting with our couch potato. Then he will go enter
1:08:06
the market make some money and then he will la
1:08:11
and target the gym market. Then he will possibly go to the next and target the
1:08:16
third market. This is what is called as segment by segment contest.
1:08:33
This is what is called as a segment by segment contest. This is how you do
1:08:37
targeting. If you have that much money, you can do everything at the same time.
1:08:42
You can choose all the three groups. But you do not have that much money. So
1:08:46
which is the most easiest favorable group that I can focus. For example,
1:08:50
Teran had had say $100 million. He could have
1:08:55
launched a tsai program, a better BMS. Okay. a like a UG PG a executive program
1:09:04
10 programs he could have launched at the same time targeting different target
1:09:08
audience but he did not have that much money so he started with the
1:09:12
undergraduate program made some money and then he launched the DSA program
1:09:17
he'll make some more money then he launched the mast's program then he
1:09:20
launched the executive program this is what is a segment by segment contest
1:09:25
depending on what your strengths are you do this that completes targeting Any
1:09:31
questions? Any questions? The next step is
1:09:35
positioning. I will not do positioning today. I know that all of your drain
1:09:38
today. Okay, we'll stop here. But wait, you are not going anywhere. We will do
1:09:42
an exercise now. You I will give you a problem. Now suppose you are planning to
1:09:47
launch a spiritual travel app.
1:09:53
Try to do a segmentation. Now do you are launching a spiritual travel
1:10:01
app? No you do.
1:10:07
You are launching a spiritual travel app.
1:10:14
How will you do a segmentation for this? Do do open open your note books and try
1:10:20
to do you I also didn't have the data think
1:10:25
logically ah not the same group of people logically from for like say this
1:10:31
spiritual travel app is based out of say India okay trying to do a segmentation
1:10:36
tomorrow. Try try. Okay. Even as a group, try
1:10:58
going to spiritual places. Do it as a group. It's okay. Whoever
1:11:05
wants to do it alone do it. If you want to do it as a group, do it as well.
1:11:10
Yes. Segmentation and targeting both. You assume I also assume right willing
1:11:25
to exercise kind of a thing. So you want to segmentation segmentation
1:11:46
and targeting both seeks
1:11:52
folks listen Wednesday we will have a quiz okay I will tell you the time okay
1:11:57
most probably Wednesday evening 4:00 to 5:00 we might have a 1 hour quiz the
1:12:01
first 10 sessions still whatever I have covered today will be there for the quiz
1:12:06
either Wednesday or Thursday I'll send a me
1:12:09
next Wednesday not today
1:12:21
next week next week we need to take this bus okay
1:12:27
is the four to five slots after we have finished the That's all the sections.
1:13:00
No variables, levels. Then you start with how do you come up with the groups?
1:13:04
How do you name it? Then make your assumptions. Make your assumptions.
1:13:08
Make your own. Yes. Do it as a group. Wonderful of you.
1:13:34
How many other competitor is there? I told you in
1:13:44
the couch potato market there's no other player like Bennett was a unique niche.
1:13:51
Nobody was working in that market. What are you doing?
1:14:05
Yes. You have a problem. So you have to come up with variables.
1:14:11
They willing us to worship every day. High, medium, low. That is how like you
1:14:16
start. What are the variables? And from there they take through the entire
1:14:19
process. You can
1:14:26
of course but logically you have to make up that
1:14:30
is only okay
1:14:43
is a very harsh word Super. Okay.
1:15:02
Okay. He's an idiot. But how did you come with this?
1:15:27
No, that's not how you do. You start with a
1:15:32
come back. So high.
1:15:35
No. What? Heat. Heat.
1:15:59
Don't look at my videos. Willingness to
1:16:18
product. Okay. Willingness to purchase the app.
1:16:22
Okay. But before that, willingness to go to church. Okay.
1:16:27
Sure. It means spiritual activity. What is happen to explain that? have no
1:16:32
belie. So that is the thing right that's okay
1:16:46
think but it can be one super
1:17:17
half of the course is done today. I'm happy. Now only 10 more sessions are
1:17:22
there then I will say bye-bye. Yeah,
1:17:29
India, Singapore. Okay. Um three term semester is fine. Okay. after
1:17:35
very difficult for me to come. I'll be teaching the next match, right?
1:17:40
You go. Okay, I'm not coming. No boss, but the next match will come,
1:17:46
right? Next match. Yes, I teach.
1:17:54
I will be traveling between India and Singapore. Now I am
1:18:06
what you say. Okay. You apply the water first.
1:18:12
Now you use your own three or four or five whatever you want.
1:18:17
But you give logically what will be the age group. Say 21 to 50 or like 50 to
1:18:23
70. Okay. both male and female and willing to like travel a lot, willing to
1:18:30
like worship gods a lot. So high people like
1:18:38
this know what it is going to be here. Look at it. Look at it. Look at it. Look
1:18:47
at it. Give some better places.
1:19:04
Okay. Or like something. Okay.
1:19:17
Don't go for students alone. Okay. Students possibly students who may come
1:19:21
as students but look at it more logical. Okay. You have to have logic about what
1:19:27
sort of people will be is students is what? Less spiritual or more spiritual.
1:19:32
Yes. Then you have to just explain that. See it should come from a logic. That is
1:19:39
the thing. Not just put some names. Yeah.
1:19:43
What's next? Then like you do the clustering.
1:19:46
Yeah. Huh? And then you can profile it and then give a name and then choose one
1:19:52
particular cluster which you will start with.
1:19:57
But this is not this is the conceptual format of it. Actually how you do it
1:20:01
you'll do it in market research. Yes, this is conceptual. This is the
1:20:08
logic of it. I am teaching you the logic is segment on the basis of okay likes
1:20:16
and dislikes and then like you then profile it using demographics
1:20:21
then you choose a favorable segment on the basis of sales potential profit.
1:20:26
But how do you actually do it? You tell me.
1:20:52
So logical but that should be should be
1:20:56
logical should not be randomly. Heat. Heat.
1:21:12
possibly what to say
1:21:21
or something. So that is how like you have to log
1:21:28
not to please me. You have to start to develop the thinking. It is not about
1:21:34
giving an answer to me. So how do you actually do it? You learn in market
1:21:38
research. You learn it in market research. How do you actually collect
1:21:42
the data and apply it and they come up with the signals that in Singapore?
1:21:54
Yes. What have you done? I remember
1:22:02
spiritual secret culture enjoyment beginner travel. Seriously, we'll be
1:22:05
coming up with some better names. Okay, it's fine. But you have to think of some
1:22:10
better names. That's fine. So how many people? 62 27.
1:22:17
How this how this 100 people is small? That's okay. Like fine. Okay. This is
1:22:24
just a sample. Yeah.
1:22:27
Which is the target. First target. What we
1:22:34
That's the first target. Friends, did you understand segmentation
1:22:44
and targeting? We better be prepared for that. Okay.
1:23:01
Yes. Yes.
1:23:10
Heat. Heat. I shouldn't be touch.
1:23:42
Christmas and then you got the logic. I got you
1:23:47
got the logic. Okay. Huh.
1:23:52
There's nothing wrong potential potential.
1:23:56
Okay. What are you going to do with them?
1:24:17
I think something You should be convinced.
1:24:57
Okay. See you after one week. I will come next Monday only.
1:25:18
learn. Okay, those who have not got it, you please learn from others. Okay,
1:25:24
Wednesday there will be a quiz. Okay, good.

How to build a long-lasting brand?
16/10/2025 | 12:00 PM - 01:30 PM
Dr. Bhupesh Manoharan
0:08
Okay, great. Good morning. Let's begin. Any questions?
0:16
I don't think you people bothered to even go and look at anything yesterday.
0:21
Okay, but any questions? Okay, great. Let me do a recap myself. Okay. So what
0:30
did we see? Okay. What did we see?
0:37
Ah marketing mix of course. So whenever like a consumers think of a problem.
0:44
Okay. So they think of solutions right that solution is what is called as a
0:50
want or this is also called as a marketing mix. Right?
0:57
The solution is called as a want or it is also called as a marketing mix and of
1:02
course it is called as a value proposition or it is also called as an
1:06
offering. Why? When you're buying something you're not just buying a
1:10
product. Suppose if I buying a pen. So my problem is I need to write on the
1:16
board. Okay. So that my students can see it when I'm teaching. That is my
1:20
problem. So I am buying this pen. Right? This pen is the product. But I'm buying
1:25
this pen from a place. It can be an in online place or an offline place. Keep
1:31
the phones away, please. Okay.
1:35
And I have a I'm paying a price for it. And I know about this product through a
1:40
promotion. Okay. So when I am buying something in I am actually buying the
1:45
product place price promotion. Yes. And then like we saw what is a product.
1:59
We saw a product is nothing but a bundle of features that provide a core benefit.
2:04
Okay. So and we saw what are all the different levels of a product. Okay. We
2:09
saw what are all the different levels of the product. What are they? There is a
2:13
core benefit. Then there is an expected product, augmented product and there is
2:17
a potential product. Okay. The expected product is the basic point of par that
2:22
like we are looking at. Okay. So this is what without the point of parity you
2:27
will not even consider that as a product. For example this pen is there
2:32
it has to have a cap. Without a cap if a pen is available you even take this
2:36
product you not. Okay. So the basic product the expected product is it will
2:40
have a shaft and it will have a cap. Okay. Okay. Then all these pens are like
2:45
this. Both these pens are like this. Then what is the point of difference?
2:49
That is the argumentation. Okay, that is the argumentation. Now what is the
2:54
argumentation here? Both these pen pens are writing say 10,000 m 10,000 m. But
2:59
this pen is going to write smooth. Then the smoothness becomes the
3:05
argumentation. Okay, the argumentation is the point of difference. Right now as
3:11
soon as like this brand comes and says boss my pen is writing smooth. Will this
3:16
pen keep quiet? They will also say that like boss like this pen is also writing
3:21
smooth. Okay. If you create a point of difference immediately the market will
3:25
convert that into a point of parity or an expected product. I told you right it
3:30
suppose like you are having a hotel these three people. Okay. So this is
3:34
clean bed, clean sheets, clean toilet say 200 dhams. Clean bed, clean sheets,
3:39
clean toilet 200 dhams. Clean bed, clean sheets, clean toilet 200 dirhams. People
3:43
will be going to any one of this because all them all of them are next to each
3:48
other. Now suppose our boy comes and says clean bed, clean sheets, clean
3:52
toilet. So free breakfast 200 dirhams. Where is all of us going to go to that?
3:59
So that what he did was he added a new feature and he augmented the product.
4:04
Right? Will these two people keep quiet? They will also add the free breakfast.
4:09
They will also add the free breakfast. So as soon as you create a point of
4:12
difference, the market or the competition will not keep quiet. They
4:16
will convert the argumented product into an expected product. Yes.
4:20
What works better like put the price on or maybe offer more than your
4:26
See the thing is that lowering the price is the last thing that you have to do.
4:29
Okay? Lowering the price is an ugly race to the bottom. Nobody wins that race.
4:35
Okay? It is a bad strategy. We will talk about
4:37
that when we coming to price. It is always better to increase the benefits
4:41
rather than the reducing the cost. Okay. Or reducing the price. Are you able to
4:46
get it? Okay. So suppose like if every augmentation is done now the future
4:52
augumentation that is going to come that is what we called as of the potential
4:55
product. Right. So these are the different levels of a product. We saw
4:59
what are all the different levels of a product. Then we saw what are all the
5:04
different types of a product. What are the different types of a product or
5:08
services? We said that products or services are of three types, right?
5:14
Search goods. Search goods, experience goods and
5:18
credence goods. What are search goods? Okay, those goods that you can evaluate
5:24
before consumption. Experience goods are those goods that
5:28
you can evaluate only after consumption. Credence goods are those goods that you
5:33
cannot even evaluate even after consumption and that is why you go with
5:37
the credibility of the service provider. Okay, that is why we are going with the
5:41
credibility of the service provider like all professional services are credence
5:45
goods. But is there anything that we can classify as search goods? Is there
5:50
anything that you can evaluate? No. Why? You're saying that these two pens write
5:55
one is writing 10,000 m. Okay, the another one is writing 12,000 m. Yes,
6:00
you can evaluate on the basis of this. But when you are going to say this pen
6:04
writes sleek or smooth, can you measure smoothness?
6:09
Coefficient of friction mu is equal to. So can you measure that? You cannot. Are
6:14
you able to get it? So there is nothing called as a search goods because every
6:19
product has some service component and the service has some product components.
6:24
Okay. So that is why there is nothing called as a search good. Okay. To be
6:28
very honest, this is why listen there is nothing called as a search good because
6:34
okay products and services they are not standalone things. What is
6:40
the meaning of it? Listen see something this is very important. So this is where
6:44
we have to understand what is the difference between a product and a
6:47
service. This is where we left you right to understand what is the difference
6:51
between a product versus a service. We said that product is also a bundle of
6:58
features that provide a core benefit. Service is also a bundle of features
7:02
that provide a core benefit. But how is a service different from a product? How
7:07
is a service different from a product? Services are very very very high on
7:11
intangibility. Okay, services are very very very high
7:16
on four parameters. Services are very high on intangibility.
7:27
Services are very very high on variability.
7:35
Services are very high on simultenity and services are very very high on
7:45
perishability. This is what happens in a service. What
7:53
is the meaning of it? Services are very very very high on intangibility. What is
7:58
the meaning of it? Okay, services cannot be measured or very difficult to measure
8:04
a service. But products are high on tangibility. Okay, what is the meaning
8:08
of it? There are two mobile phones. Okay, can you compare these two mobile
8:14
phones? Say this mobile phone has 2 GB RAM. This mobile phone has 3 GB RAM.
8:19
This mobile phone has like a 50 GB storage space. Okay. This mobile phone
8:24
has like 80 GB storage space. This mobile phone and 13 in sorry uh says 9
8:30
in screen. Okay. This one has like a and a 7 in screen. This has like 200 g in
8:36
weight. This has like a 250 g in weight. Can we compare these things as products?
8:42
Yes, products are high on tangibility. So, you can compare them. But what about
8:48
services? services are very very very high on
8:53
intangibility. Okay. What is the meaning of it? Can you compare two services?
8:58
Okay. Can you compare two services? Okay. So say Karim versus like a
9:03
talabat. Karim and Talabad both of them are
9:06
providing convenience. Can you measure convenience?
9:09
No. Can you measure convenience?
9:12
Ah so what he's saying with time maybe. Okay. convenient. Both of them are
9:17
providing convenience. Okay. But the thing is that Karim is coming and saying
9:22
bos we will provide this in 9 minutes. Talabat is coming and saying we will
9:27
provide this in 12 minutes. Okay. So what they are doing is service
9:32
convenience is very high on intangibility. Please listen. Services
9:36
are very very high on intangibility. So to reduce the intangibility what did you
9:42
say? Okay. Time maybe okay 9 minutes 11 minutes. Okay. So this is what like you
9:47
do in order to reduce the intang say products are high on tangibility
9:52
products are high on tangibility. So say let us say there are two mobile phones.
9:56
Listen all of you there are two mobile phones
9:59
2 GB RAM 2 GB RAM okay 64GB hard disk sorry 64GB like storage 64GB storage
10:07
9 in screen 9 in screen okay 200 g in weight 200 g in weight but this mobile
10:15
phone is an Apple that is a Samsung okay so what did you do what did you do you
10:21
added an intangible element called as brand products are very very very high
10:25
on intangibility. Okay, for tangibility. So in order to create a point of
10:30
difference, you add an intangible element. One such intangible element is
10:34
called as brand. Are you able to get it? But services are already high on
10:39
intangibility. Okay? Because convenience you cannot even measure convenience. So
10:43
in order to reduce the intangibility and to create a point of par or a point of
10:50
difference, what you do? You add an tangible element. And this tangible
10:55
element is what is called as a physical evidence. This tangible element is what
11:00
we call as a physical evidence. Are you able to get it?
11:07
This tangible element is what we call as a physical
11:12
evidence. Are you able to get it? What is this?
11:18
Products are high on tangibility. So to create a point of difference you add
11:24
intangible elements. Services are high on intangibility. So to create a point
11:29
of difference you add tangible elements. They are called as physical evidences.
11:33
But the moment you add tangible evidences
11:36
or elements others will start to copy. For example I told you right Karim and
11:43
Talabat. Okay. Convenience. Convenience. Very intangible. Is it very very very
11:49
intangible. Keep the phones away please. Okay. Very very intangible. Now what did
11:54
he say? I will deliver in 10 minutes. He is saying I will deliver in 12 minutes.
11:59
The moment you add in tangible element what will he do? No no I will also
12:04
deliver in 10 minutes. Convenience. Convenience. He said 10 minutes. He's
12:08
also saying in 10 minutes now in order to stand out what should he do?
12:15
Like h
12:16
discounts. Discounts is the promotion. you know I'm
12:19
not talking about that what you do now improve the experience
12:22
improve the experience but is experience can be measured
12:26
no so that is the thing so for a sustained point of difference you also
12:30
you always have to add an intangible element and that intangible element is
12:34
what is called as okay for example the guy who's coming and delivering it he's
12:40
smiling at him that is an intangible element he'll feel happy
12:46
are you able to get it okay are you able to get it So products are high on
12:50
tangibility. So to create a point of difference you add intangible elements.
12:54
Services on the other hand are very very high on intangibility. To create a point
12:59
of difference you add tangible elements but that will be copied fast. It will
13:03
create a point of difference but a shorter point of difference. Okay. A
13:06
short-term point of difference. So to create a sustainable point of difference
13:11
you have to add an intangible element only. And one such element is what is
13:16
called as a brand. Are you able to get it? Yes. Hey, this is where I left you.
13:22
Okay, this is where I left you. Now, let's try to finish the other things.
13:26
Now, what is variability? What is variability?
13:32
Okay, products are deliver sorry products are
13:38
less on variability. Services are high on variability. What is the meaning of
13:44
variability? Okay. Services are provided by human beings.
13:50
Services are provided by human beings. So it is going to change from one human
13:57
being to another human being. Even with the same human being, it is going to
14:02
change from the time of the day. Wake up. Okay. Morning 8:30 coming and like
14:08
sit sit sit sits properly. Huh. Now services are provided by human beings.
14:14
So it is going to change from one human being to another human being. Even if
14:19
the same human being is going to deliver the service, okay, it is going to change
14:22
from the time of the day. What is the meaning of it? Suppose if I am taking
14:26
this course versus Shivangi is going to come and take this course. Is the course
14:31
going to be the same course? No. It is going to be even though we
14:36
will teach the same topic, is it is the experience going to be the same? Is the
14:40
experience going to be the same? No, it is not. Suppose today morning I'm taking
14:45
the session at 8:30 versus I'm going to take the session at say 2:30 in the
14:50
afternoon. Is the experience going to be the same?
14:52
No. Because services are high on variability. Now, how will you reduce
14:57
this variability? Tell me. But if I sell this product in the morning 8:30 versus
15:02
I sell this product at like same pen at like evening 2:30, will the pen change?
15:06
No. The pen will be the same. Right? Products are less on variability.
15:10
Products are less on variability but services are high on variability. How do
15:14
you reduce this variability? Tell me how do you reduce this variability?
15:20
How will you reduce? See if I am going to teach this course or Shivangi is
15:23
going to teach this course. How do you reduce variability? Tell me.
15:28
Exactly. So what did he say? You will have to put in a process. You will have
15:35
to put in a process. Okay. So to reduce this variability what you people do is
15:40
you put in a process a standard operating procedure okay a standard
15:45
operating procedure what is the meaning of it boss if at all the session is from
15:51
8:30 to 10:00 first 20 minutes you have to cover intangibility next 10 minutes
15:57
you have to cover variability the next 10 minutes you have to cover simultenity
16:02
next 10 minutes you have to cover perishability then the next 20 minutes
16:06
you have to cover or say 15 minutes you have to cover product life cycle and
16:10
last five minutes you have to revise if I'm going to put in the process okay can
16:16
I reduce this variability can I reduce this variability between if
16:20
if I am going to teach or like if Shivangi is going to teach can I reduce
16:24
this variability that is what you can never remove variability okay you can
16:29
never remove variability but we can reduce variability similarly you can
16:33
never remove intangibility you can reduce intangibility ility by adding
16:36
physical evidences. For example, let us say you're going to a restaurant. Okay.
16:42
So, I am a chef. I am a bartender. I am he she is also one particular bartender.
16:49
Do you really think both of our like services are going to be the same?
16:54
No. If I am going to provide the service in the morning versus in the evening, is
16:58
my service going to be the same? No. But so to reduce this variability,
17:03
what do I do? What do I do? I will come and say boss as soon as the guest comes
17:08
in you have to say either good morning,
17:11
good afternoon or good evening depending on the time of the day. The guest should
17:15
be seated in the next 2 minutes. The order should be taken in the next 2
17:21
minutes. The food must be prepared in the next 20 minutes. The once the food
17:28
is prepared, it should be delivered in the next 2 minutes.
17:32
The moment the guest finish finishes the meal, okay, the bill must be provided in
17:37
the next one minute. Once the bill has been paid, then the
17:42
guest should be shown out in the next 2 minutes. If I'm going to put this
17:47
process whether like if I deliver the service or him deliver, he delivers the
17:50
service, can I reduce the variability? But can you remove the variability? No.
17:56
Suppose I'm going to greet him like a good morning, good afternoon or good
17:59
evening. Suppose I'm saying good morning. Good morning.
18:02
Good morning. Good morning.
18:04
Good morning. Okay, all these are different different good mornings,
18:07
right? Are you are these the same good morning? No, I'm saying good morning.
18:11
Hey, good morning. Okay, so both of these are different good mornings. You
18:14
can just put in a process but you cannot completely reduce variability. Are you
18:19
able to get it? Are you able to get it? So what is variability? Variability
18:25
services are provided by human beings. So services are going to be variable. It
18:30
is going to vary from one individual to another individual.
18:34
So to reduce variability, what do you do? You put in a process. Are you able
18:40
to get it? Yes or no?
18:43
Process you mean like time frame. It's a standard pro operating procedure.
18:46
It is a SOP. Okay. You put in a standard operating procedure. Okay. Now, but what
18:52
is the simultenity? What is simultenity?
18:59
Anybody? What is simultenity? Yes.
19:03
Do multiple things at the same time? No.
19:06
No. You can offer
19:09
many service at the same time. No. That's not close.
19:14
No. Okay. Sort of. Yes. Okay. Simultaneity to a certain extent. Yes.
19:18
But that is what is not. It's a simultaneity problem. For example,
19:21
listen. Listen. This is something where you can like differentiate a product and
19:24
a service. Suppose if I have to give a haircut to him. There's some stupidity
19:29
in the hair. If I have to give a haircut to him, his head should be present here.
19:34
I cannot give a haircut if he is not present here. Okay. Services. Okay. But
19:40
product I he need not be present to buy the bag. I can deliver it online also.
19:45
Okay. Now I cannot give a haircut to him if his head is not here. If suppose he's
19:51
going to remove the hair alone and I'm going to give a haircut and give it back
19:56
then that is not a service anymore. That is a product. That is what we call as a
20:00
wig. Okay. Services are simultaneously
20:05
produced and consumed. Okay. This is why SAS is a product. How many of you says
20:11
no software as a service? What is the full form of a SAS? Software as a
20:14
service. Right? But SAS is a product. Okay. Why? because there is no need for
20:20
the presence of a producer and a consumer at the same time. Okay. For for
20:26
example, is YouTube a product or a service? Tell me, is YouTube a product
20:31
or a service? How many of you say it is a service?
20:36
Huh? Is it a product or a service? YouTube.
20:42
It is. H both. Just now if there is a live streaming if there is a live
20:48
streaming then that is a service okay if there's a live streaming it is a service
20:53
but if you are going to upload the video and you can use it again and again then
20:58
that is a product okay in YouTube for example this class
21:04
if I have to provide this class you people should be present here if you are
21:08
not present here I cannot deliver the service the consumer and the producer
21:12
should be there at the same time if you are not going to be present here I
21:17
cannot deliver the service suppose I am going to record this lecture and I'm
21:20
going to upload it in your LMS that is not a service anymore that becomes a
21:23
product are able to get it okay so a service is
21:28
high on simultenity product is not high on simultenity in when you're using a
21:33
product the service provider need not be there you're using this pen this the
21:37
maker of the pen and the with you now no but uh so the product need not like have
21:43
service provider and the consumer at the same time. Okay. But any service okay
21:49
you have to have both the service provider and the consumer at the same
21:52
time. Are you able to get it? This is what is a simultenity. Yes.
21:56
So what about a product or service? Travel agency.
22:02
But it's not consumed when you're like on.
22:07
Yeah. It's a service. A service.
22:08
Yes. Okay. Because one ticket is booked. Okay. Okay, the service gets completed
22:13
otherwise the service does not get completed. Okay, are you able to get it?
22:17
Are you able to get this part? Okay, now what is the simultenity problem? Okay,
22:22
you understood what is simultenity? Services are simultaneously produced and
22:26
consumed. Okay, but what is the simultaneity problem? Services I told
22:32
you are provided by people. So it is variable. To reduce variability what did
22:36
you do? You put in a process. But services are provided to people.
22:44
Services are provided to human beings and every human being is different
22:51
and I have to provide the service to multiple human beings at the same time.
22:55
I cannot say you both use the pen at the same time. This is a product. I cannot
23:00
say both the people can use the pen at the same time. But services multiple
23:04
people can sit in the same class at the same time. So suppose our boy is
23:09
understanding whatever I say after I repeat it three times
23:16
but our boy is understanding it only if I repeat it okay seven times
23:23
no both of them are different right now what should I do should I repeat it
23:28
three times or seven times and both of them are sitting simultaneously in the
23:33
class this is what is a simultaneity problem okay services are provided to
23:39
human beings and those human beings are different. How do I reduce this problem?
23:45
Tell me how do I reduce this problem? Huh?
23:50
No, you no I cannot. Okay. If I repeat it three times, he's understanding. If I
23:55
repeat it seven times only, he is understanding. Okay. Now, if I repeat it
23:59
only three times, he will understand. But he will not understand.
24:03
But if I have to repeat it seven times, he will understand but he will get
24:08
bored. So what should I do now? Tell me. Repeat it five times so that like he
24:14
also is bored. Okay. He's also not going to understand. And that's a bad strategy
24:19
like so. Exactly. So what I will do is I will
24:24
possibly repeat it four times so our boy understands. Then I will call him. Okay.
24:29
For an officer. Okay. And I'll make him explain two three more times so that he
24:33
understands. Are you able to get it? Okay. So for that I should be trained
24:39
right. I should be the one who should be trained to know whether he understood or
24:43
he did not understand and by looking at them. So how can you reduce the
24:48
simultenity problem is by training whom? Me the service provider. Okay. Training
24:54
the service provider or the people. Okay. So by training the service
25:00
provider or the people you can reduce the simultenity issue. Are you able to
25:05
get it? Are you able to get it? See this is a wonderful concept and like you have
25:09
to understand now listen I'll give you a different example. Okay
25:15
see products sorry services are provided by human beings.
25:22
So it is going to be changing from human being to human being or it is high on
25:26
variability. How will you reduce variability? You'll put in a process.
25:31
But services are delivered to human beings and they are very very different
25:36
to reduce the simultenity. Okay. What are you going to do? You're going to
25:40
train your people. Okay. Why should you train your people? Why should you train
25:45
your people? There is a logic there. Right? Now listen. Listen all of you.
25:50
Now let us say there is a airport.
25:57
Okay listen all of you there is an airport and I am a air host standing
26:04
here. Now let us what are your names? I do not know your names. Okay. What is
26:08
your name? Huh?
26:11
Rashish. It was very difficult. Put martin. Okay.
26:16
You Santiago.
26:17
Santiago. Okay. Wonderful. Rashish. Martin and Santiago. Okay, I think I I
26:22
remember Santiago. Now listen, Rashish, Martin and Santiago.
26:28
These three people are coming to the Listen, listen.
26:36
These three guys are coming to the airport. Okay,
26:41
I am the air host. Rashish came first, Martin came second. Okay, Santiago came
26:47
third. What should I do now? Whether I am the air host or like a say
26:53
he is the air host. What should we do now? We have to follow the process.
26:56
Okay. Because it should be same. So what will I do? Listen. Listen. I will allow
27:01
first. Rash came first. Rash will go first. Martin came second. Martin will
27:05
go second. And Santiago came third. He will go third. Yes or no? Whether I do
27:10
it or he does it or he does it or she does it, we have to follow the process.
27:16
Okay. But this is where it gets interesting. Instead of
27:23
Rash Rash is here, instead of Martha, okay, there is a pregnant lady.
27:30
A pregnant lady. Instead of Santiago, like there is a old man.
27:37
Now, will I follow the process? Okay. Will I say that? No. No. Rash, you came
27:41
first, you go in. Okay. Santia, the pregnant lady came second, she goes
27:46
second. And like old man goes uh came third, he goes third. No, what will I
27:51
do? First I will say, oh let the pregnant lady go first.
27:56
Then the old person, you are young. Okay, you can wait and you can go third.
28:00
So what did I do? I broke the process. I broke the process. Okay. So your
28:07
people should be trained when to break the process and when not to break the
28:11
process. Are you able to get it? Are you able to
28:16
get this? Again, please listen. This is very very very important. These two will
28:19
look like they are the paradox of each other. They are not.
28:23
Services are high on variability. Yes or no? Services are high on variability. To
28:29
reduce the variability, what you do? You put in a process.
28:33
Okay? Or services are provided by human beings. Services are provided by human
28:39
beings. So it is variable. So to reduce the variability, you put in a process.
28:44
But services are provided to human beings.
28:49
Okay. Whose needs are very different. So in order to like reduce the
28:54
simultenity, you have to train your people. Why? To break the process. So
29:01
your people should know when to break the process and when not to break the
29:04
process. For example, let us say our or Santiago is coming and like
29:10
is coming to the airport and his flight leaves in 15 minutes and he's late
29:16
because of a traffic. Will I come and simply say something? No, no, no, no,
29:21
wait. Okay, you have to follow the process. You have to go through this
29:24
entire like checkin and like you have to go like this only then he will miss the
29:28
flight. So what will I do now? I will just grab him. Okay, quickly take him to
29:33
the emergency route and then I will run with him possibly till the hanger. Okay,
29:38
so that like he can get the the flight on time. So what did I do? I broke the
29:42
process. But if I am going to simply say Rashish is my student, he came go inside
29:47
first. Can I break the process just like that? No. So 99%age of the time you will
29:53
follow the process only. But for those exceptional cases, you will break the
29:57
process. For that your people should be trained when to break the process and
30:01
when not to break the process. Are you able to get it? Okay. Services are high
30:06
on variability. Services are very very very high on variability. To reduce
30:11
variability, you put in a process. But services are very very high on
30:15
simultenity as well. Okay. So to reduce simultenity issues, you break the
30:21
process. For that you have to train your people when to break the process and
30:25
when not to break the process. Are you able to get it?
30:29
Are you able to get the logic of this? Yes. Okay, great. Because the last one
30:34
is going to take some time. Now, what is perishability? What is perishability?
30:38
Anyone? Huh?
30:44
It expires. Product also expires. Products are also a product also
30:48
expires. This pen and after writing it also expires. What is the meaning of
30:52
perishability? Services.
30:54
Services are very high on perishability. Product also perish. Product is also
30:58
like a variable. Product is also simultaneous. But like services are very
31:02
very very high on perishability. Now what is the meaning of it? Now let us
31:06
say okay let us say our like okay is selling notebooks. He's making
31:16
and selling notebooks. Okay. Every day Marthan makes
31:25
120 notebooks. Okay. Every day Marthan makes 120 notebooks.
31:31
On Monday. Okay. But Monday there is a demand for
31:36
80 not notebooks. How many notebooks can he sell?
31:42
80. He can sell 80 notebooks. On Tuesday
31:49
again he makes 120 notebooks but there is a demand for 150 notebooks.
31:56
How many can he sell? He can sell all the 150. Why? Because
32:00
there are 40 notebooks here. You add this. Okay. You sell 150 and there'll be
32:05
10 notebooks left. Yes or no? Yes. Okay. Now where are you from?
32:13
Ecuador. Ecuador. Okay. So
32:17
now let us say there is a flight from Dubai to Quito. Okay.
32:30
Keto okay but I know no I know it's what is the u
32:37
uio? Okay I do not know that is called as UIO. Okay. PTO is okay. There is a
32:46
flight from Dubai to PTO. Okay. Every day this flight leaves at 5 p.m. Every
32:54
day the flight leaves at 5 p.m. Okay. Right.
32:58
And there are 120 seats in the flight. The flight has 120 seats. Okay.
33:05
Now on Monday when the flight leaves, okay, there are
33:11
80 people sitting in the flight. How many people can travel?
33:15
At at 4 p.m. and the doors closed, there are 80 people sitting. How many people
33:20
can travel? 80 people. Yes. On Tuesday,
33:30
the flight again leaves at 5 p.m. Okay. There are 120 seats. At 400 p.m.
33:39
when the doors close are supposed to close, there are 150 people sitting in
33:43
the lounge. How many people can travel?
33:48
120. Yes. Only 120 can travel. What happened to
33:53
the remaining 40 seats here? What happened to the 40 seats here?
34:00
They got perished. they got perished. Okay, this is the
34:06
meaning of perishability. Services are high on perishability means services
34:11
cannot be stored in an inventory. Services cannot be stored in an
34:17
inventory. Products can be stored in an inventory. Okay? Like here you stored
34:21
the product 40 notebooks and next day you used but services cannot be stored
34:26
in an inventory. If you are not going to like use that particular service, it
34:30
will perish forever. For example, on this day 16th of October, okay, from
34:36
morning like 8:30 to 10:00, okay, if I am not able to deliver this lecture, I
34:41
can never deliver this lecture. Why? Because this lecture would have perished
34:46
forever. This lecture would have perished forever. This is what is
34:50
perishability. Boss, listen. Services are high on perishability. So, how do I
34:56
like remove perishability or reduce
34:59
perishability? What can I do to like make sure that this 40 seats do not go
35:05
waste? What should I do? You get the problem that 40 seats if it
35:11
is not going to go. Oh, okay. How do I reduce this perishability? Tell me.
35:16
Huh? What sort of promotion?
35:25
Huh? No. Huh? Smaller plane.
35:28
Pardon? a smaller plane instead of a big airplane.
35:32
No. Okay. So, our boy is saying, "Okay, can I can I have like 80 seat plane and
35:39
120 seat plane? Do you think planes are like costly, cheaper?" Okay, they're
35:43
very costly, right? Can I like buy a 180 seat plane and a 150 seat plane? That I
35:49
cannot do. So, what can I do to reduce perishability? Tell me what can I do to
35:55
reduce this perishability? The seat is anyways going waste. I have to like make
35:58
sure that the seat does not go waste. What do you do?
36:02
No. Okay. Ah, what? I want to go on Tuesday.
36:09
You'll make me go on Monday. There is no other people going to like
36:16
Okay. What do I do? Huh?
36:20
Exactly. So, perishability can be reduced. Okay. Only through what did he
36:26
say? reduce the price. Okay. Perishability
36:30
can be reduced only by reducing the price.
36:36
So what is the meaning of it? Listen. By reducing the price. So what is the
36:46
meaning of it? How to do this? Listen. This is something very very very
36:49
important. Now how do you reduce this perishability thing? Now if you look at
36:54
perishability, okay, see services typically if you look at services,
37:00
services are very very high on something called as fixed cost. Okay, services are
37:06
very very high on something called as fixed cost. The fixed cost of services
37:10
is very high. But the variable cost of services, okay,
37:16
the variable cost of services is very low or almost equal to zero.
37:22
Okay, almost equal to zero. See, for example, I told you let us say this
37:26
flight is going from Dubai to
37:31
PTO. Okay. Okay. Now, what is the fixed cost?
37:36
Whether like there are people inside or not. Okay. The flight has to incur some
37:40
fixed cost, right? What are the fixed cost?
37:43
What are the fixed costs? Tell me. There will be a rental cost.
37:48
rental or the lease cost for the flight. Okay. Then there is the fuel cost. What
37:56
else? Employees the labor cost. What else?
38:02
Huh? Fuel I have written. Okay. What else?
38:07
Huh? Then there is a airport tax and food is variable. Airport tax. Then
38:12
there is a parking fee. Okay. All these and there are multiple
38:19
other fixed costs. These are very very very high. Okay. Typically they are very
38:22
very high. The parking fee in Dubai airport and all will be very very high.
38:26
That is why some of the flights okay they come land here and then they move
38:29
to Abu Dhabi. Okay. Like in order to park there. Okay. The parking fees are
38:34
very very very high. Okay. These are the airport tax parking fees. These are the
38:38
fixed costs whether you like it or not. Okay. Whether you like it or not. Okay.
38:43
You will have to incur this particular cost. Yes. Now what are all the variable
38:48
cost? that suppose our martin okay what is the variable cost of
38:54
like a moving m say the x maran is not so bulky but let us say he's having 20
39:00
kgs weight okay to transport him and other 20 kgs weight of course they have
39:06
to like incur some price rate let us say that extra fuel cost is say 200 dhams
39:15
or say 300 dhams this is the fuel first. So possibly okay they will give him one
39:29
or two cups of water or orange juice or like let us say some wine okay and one
39:34
or two meals that they are giving let us say the price of that is like say 100
39:39
dhams okay because the food what what they're going to give
39:45
is 100 dhams then Our boy is sitting okay possibly he
39:54
does not have any lot of product on his hair but let us say that they are like
39:58
changing the flap okay and possibly giving one bed sheet and they have to
40:02
clean the bed sheet and like a pillow okay so that is say 20 dhams
40:08
the washing charges so how much is it coming to 420 dhams
40:17
if they charge anything above 420 dhams if they charge Anything above 420
40:22
dirhams they're going to make some money. Even if they're charging 421
40:27
dhams they will make one dirham extra rather than the seat going waste. Yes or
40:32
no? Anyway the seat is going waste. Okay. So
40:36
if they charge anything above that 420 dirhams at least okay will they be able
40:40
to make some money. So what they do okay what do like airports do is or airplane
40:46
services do is they do this. Okay. Typically they have a price for
40:58
this is how they do the pricing. Okay. One year before if you're going to book
41:07
okay the price will be very very very let's say possibly 1,000 dhams. Okay.
41:11
Why? Like they will have to put some seeds on the some butts on the seats.
41:18
Okay. Okay. So they have to make like a sum they have to make the plane viable.
41:22
Okay. But if you're going to just book and the price will be keeping on
41:25
increasing 1 month before. Okay. If you're going to book
41:29
3 months before you the price will go up. One month before the price will be
41:34
very very high then let us say 15 days is there for the flight to leave and
41:38
there are not many seats okay filled. Okay. So what they will do is they will
41:42
try to reduce the price a bit on the day of travel. Okay. or one day
41:48
before the travel the prices will be very very very high. Why? Because those
41:52
people are going for some personal emergency or some official trip they
41:55
will be willing to pay that much amount of price. By altering the price okay by
42:00
altering the price okay they will reduce this perishability. Are you able to get
42:04
it? By altering the price this is what is called as dynamic pricing. Okay. by
42:09
altering the price. Okay. Once I traveled from India to New Zealand and
42:13
back in $220. Okay. India to New Zealand and back.
42:21
Okay. I booked my tickets $220. Okay. I booked my tickets in October to
42:28
travel in November. Okay. Next November. Not this November.
42:33
Okay. One. Next year. So for typical Okay.
42:37
cheapos like me, okay? They will keep it at a very low price, okay? Because we
42:41
will book the flight like a but only thing is that they will if I cancel it,
42:45
they will not return the fair. Huh?
42:49
Huh? But you can easily go and like come back. Are you able to get it? Are you
42:54
able to get it? Okay. So, this is exactly what is dynamic pricing. Okay.
42:59
For example, hotels, restaurants, they have happy hearts,
43:04
right? What are happy hearts? You look at the restaurant from afternoon 12:00
43:09
p.m. to morning 12:00 a.m. Okay. Or 1:00 a.m. in the morning, the restaurant is
43:14
completely open. But 12:00 to 3:00 the restaurant is full because all of you
43:18
are wanting to having lunch. So that is what like they do. But evening 5:00 to
43:23
7:00 anyways the employees are there the place you are paying rent. So what you
43:28
do you give happy hearts. Okay. So 40%age or 50%age of Okay. So
43:35
that is the thing for example like if you are planning to take make a trip to
43:39
oh let us say Switzerland okay
43:50
or like let us say like if you're planning to trip to India like Goa
43:57
so I do not know how many of you have visited India I'm not talking about the
44:01
Indians okay who have been in India I'm not above others Okay. Now, if you're
44:05
visiting India, it's a very good place called as Goa. Okay. Now, if you look at
44:10
it's a it's a it's a wonderful state. Okay. It's a very beautiful beaches and
44:14
stuff. If you're really a beach person, you should definitely visit Goa. Okay.
44:17
Now, if you look at Goa, listen, April 1st
44:24
to September 30th, we call this off season
44:30
because this is Goa's beautiful in like summer and rainy season. But this is the
44:34
summer and rainy season. But people do not go there. Okay? Because it's a off
44:38
season. From October 1st to December 21st,
44:45
this is what is the peak season. December 22nd to January 5th,
44:53
this is the super peak season. And Jan 6th to
45:00
March 31st, again this is called as peak season.
45:05
Now they will divide the entire calendar like this. For example, suppose if our
45:09
boy is going to stay in Goa. Okay. The rooms will be damn cheap. $10, $12 in
45:14
like a um summer. Okay. 800 900 rupees. Why? Because if at all like he's going
45:21
to go and stay possibly they will give one like
45:25
uh soap or like some shampoo and then like what they will do they will change
45:30
the sheets and possibly one unit of electricity will be consumed apart from
45:35
this there's going to be nothing so that will be hardly one $15 price in India
45:40
case okay so anything above that okay you'll make some money you'll make some
45:46
money so what they will do is they'll keep If it has $15, $20, okay, so that
45:50
they they make that extra amount of money. I'm talking about 1,500 rupees or
45:54
2,000 rupees. Okay. Instead of okay, say 200, 300 rupees. Yes. But if you're
45:59
going to go in the super peak season, even if you pay $3,000, you will not get
46:03
a cottage. Okay? It'll be three lakhs, four lakh
46:06
rupees you have to pay in order to get a cottage. So by altering the price
46:10
dynamically, they make sure the rooms are filled. Are you able to get it?
46:14
Listen. Listen all of you folks. Now if you look at it, this price is the one P
46:22
from the original fourpiece. If you look at the original fourpiece, price is the
46:27
one P out of the original fourpiece of product place
46:33
and promotion. Yes, promotion and price. Listen,
46:39
these are the price is the only P out of the original four Ps. These remaining
46:44
three Ps along with the original four Ps of
46:49
marketing form the seven Ps of marketing. These are the seven Ps of
46:53
marketing. Okay. So whenever like you are going to look at okay whenever
46:58
you're going to look at like any particular marketing mix it is not just
47:02
a product place price promotion. It is also physical evidence process and
47:06
people okay this together forms the original the seven piece of marketing.
47:12
For example, if you look at tetar, there is this is why I say there is nothing
47:16
called as a product or a service. You have all the seven piece for everything.
47:21
If you look at teter, there is a product. There is a classroom syllabus.
47:26
Yes. And you're delivering it out of a place like Dubai or India or Singapore.
47:33
You pay pay price for it. You got to know about it through promotions. Okay.
47:37
NAS daily kind of a thing. There is also physical evidence tet logo. Oh, like a
47:43
the curriculum and the teaching part. There is also people. There is also a
47:48
process. This class should happen from 8:30 to 10:00. The next class from 10:15
47:52
to so there's a process. First term what are the subjects? Second term what are
47:56
the subjects? Yes or no? So all the seven Ps are there for a service. Okay.
48:03
For a product also all the seven Ps are there. For example, you have a water
48:06
bottle that is a product. You bought it from a place. There is a promotion.
48:10
There is a price and there is a physical evidence called as brand. When you're
48:14
going and buying it, there is a process. He will stand first. You are standing
48:19
first and there is a service provider of the seller of the water bottle. Okay? So
48:24
all the seven PS are there for all the uh products and services. But in
48:29
services the seven PS are very very prominent. Listen all of you go to
48:33
laptops. It's very very very important. Okay. So
48:38
you are going to like make sure that like the seven piece of marketing is
48:41
what is going to be like developed in order to make your product win. Whatever
48:47
product it is be it is a digital product or a physical product. Are you able to
48:51
get it? Let's take a 5 minutes break and come
48:53
back. So that completes products and services.
49:00
Okay. Yes.
51:09
is very high. Sorry.
51:17
Variability is high. Why do you have to reduce?
51:20
Because otherwise how will you reduce variability means whether if I provide
51:24
the service because he provides the service. It is becoming different to
51:28
standardize what you do. You put in a process
55:10
How can I do this? Shall I rub this off?
56:10
Okay, great. Any questions?
56:20
Any questions? Okay. So, what did we see so far? Okay.
56:26
We said that like a boss, what is a product? What are the different levels
56:31
of a product? What are all the different types of products or services? Then what
56:36
is the difference between a product and a service? Okay. Now,
56:41
how do you strategize with the help of a product? What is the meaning of it? What
56:45
is the meaning of strategizing? Tell me what is strategy. You have used this
56:51
word strategy. Strategy strategy a lot, right? What is what the heck is
56:55
strategy. Strategy is not a plan.
56:59
Okay. Strategy is not a plan. That's what we think. Okay. It's not a plan.
57:07
I will tell you first. You tell me. Okay.
57:11
What is a strategy? A plan with execution.
57:14
A plan with execution. Okay. What is a strategy? Okay. Tell me.
57:23
How to react to certain Okay. How to react to certain
57:28
situations? Okay. So, if you look at my strategy,
57:34
ah, so is that a plan? No, but that's
57:36
No, but that's okay. What is a plan? What is the
57:39
strategy? That's what I'm asking. Okay. What is strategy? Keep your take the
57:47
headphones off. Does it strategy? Where are you from? India.
57:51
Okay. Which part of India? Mumbai.
57:53
Mumbai. Okay. You Hindor.
57:55
Indul. Okay. So tell me what is a strategy?
57:59
Strategize sometimes. Huh?
58:01
Strategizing. Okay. Strategizing. How to bunk this class. All of you. What is a
58:06
strategy? Tell me. To plan.
58:09
It's a plan. Who said I told you strategy is not a plan? Okay. Strategy.
58:14
Now that's making a mistake. Who said strategy is a plan? Did any professor
58:18
say? No. Right. Ah, nobody will say. Now
58:22
listen. Suppose like boss you have to go from here.
58:28
Let us say the Dubai campus. Okay. The tetra campus wait to myriad.
58:36
From tetra campus to myriad. How will you go boss?
58:41
You'll walk. Okay. You will. He said that he will
58:45
walk. What if you're not able? This is what is
58:48
a plan. Okay. He said that like he will walk. Okay. Suppose.
58:54
Okay. Huh. No. Possibly. Okay. That is also not the
58:59
only thing. Suppose like if you are not able to walk, what will you do then?
59:05
You'll take a cap. No caps are available.
59:09
Okay. No.
59:12
No caps are available. Then private jet.
59:15
You'll have a private jet. Okay. Wonderful. But private jets don't fly
59:19
here. Huh?
59:23
So this is exactly what is a strategy. Okay. Listen. A strategy is a process.
59:30
It is not a plan. Plan is a static thing. Okay. A strategy is a process.
59:36
Okay? If at all there is a plan A and if plan A fails, what is your plan B? If
59:43
plan B is also not operating, what is your plan C? If plan C is not not
59:47
operating, what is your plan D? So it is a collective a set of actions. Okay, a
59:53
strategy is nothing but like a set of actions. Okay,
59:58
why do you do these actions? A set of actions for what?
1:00:04
For benefit. For like achieving a goal or for
1:00:08
achieving a what is the goal here in marketing?
1:00:12
H to make money. To make money, right? Okay. Yes, boss.
1:00:17
You have a question. Yeah. But isn't it same?
1:00:21
No, that is one plan. What if the plan fails?
1:00:24
So, we are evaluating the best. Ah, yes. Okay. Strategy is a process.
1:00:29
Okay. It's a series of actions or set of actions. Okay. To do what? To maximize
1:00:37
value. Whose value? Stakeholder value. Here like it is all about like
1:00:42
stakeholders value is all about the money right strategy is a set of actions
1:00:47
to maximize stakeholder value under what? Under uncertaintity.
1:00:54
Why? Because if plan A fails okay plan B. Okay. So you are not certain about
1:00:59
like this will work. S strategy is nothing but a set of collective steps.
1:01:06
Okay. Strategy is nothing but a series of actions. Okay? Or it is a collective
1:01:13
steps to maximize stakeholder value under uncertainty. That is exactly what
1:01:20
is strategy. Okay. Strategy is a collective set of actions. Okay. To
1:01:26
maximize stakeholder value here. Maximize profits
1:01:31
under uncertaintity. Now we are going to see how do you strategize with the help
1:01:37
of a product. What is the meaning of it? Using product how can you maximize
1:01:44
money or profits. Okay. When you are uncertain about whether the product will
1:01:50
sell or not. So how do you strategize? First let us try to understand how not
1:01:56
to strategize. Okay. How not to strategize because the entire industry
1:02:00
strategizes on the basis of that. Okay. And that is the most stupid thing to do.
1:02:04
Okay. Now this is where first how not to strategize. I told you right strategy is
1:02:10
all about your actions to make money. Okay. Under uncertaintity because I do
1:02:15
not know whether the product will sell. I do not know whether the promotion will
1:02:18
work. I do not know whether this pricing will be good or not. I do not know
1:02:21
whether this distribution will work or not. So but I have to still make it
1:02:25
work. as a strategy is a set of actions that I
1:02:30
have to do to maximize money or maximize profits under uncertaintity. Now how do
1:02:37
you strategize with the help of a product? Okay, first let us see how do
1:02:42
you not strategize with the help of a production that is exactly where oh the
1:02:47
we are going to see the most abused framework okay by almost all the
1:02:53
marketers okay which is the product life
1:02:58
cycle how many of you have used this PLC as a framework studied how many of you
1:03:05
have studied this PLC at least you know what is a product life cycle heard about
1:03:09
the product life cycle You just have to Google product life
1:03:12
cycle and everybody will give you strategy after strategy using like a
1:03:16
product life cycle. Okay. Only problem is it's a stupid framework. Okay.
1:03:23
Now let's listen. Okay. I I'll I'll prove why it is stupid.
1:03:27
Listen I'll prove why it is stupid. Okay. Now
1:03:31
first anybody who has studied this or used this particular framework
1:03:37
anybody has used this framework. What are the axis of the framework?
1:03:43
There are four stages. I don't want the stages. You tell me.
1:03:46
What is the axis? I know it also has the four stages.
1:03:51
What? One is time. What is the others?
1:03:56
One is time. What is this other axis? It is sales of the product over time. Yes,
1:04:05
this is time and this is the sales of the product over time.
1:04:09
That is what is the strategy part. Now like if you look at it, the product life
1:04:15
cycle states that okay boss every product goes through four stages. What
1:04:20
are they? There is something called as an introduction stage.
1:04:29
There is something called as growth. then maturity
1:04:36
and of course decline and finally death. Okay. And for each stage there is a
1:04:41
different strategy. Now let me ask a simple question.
1:04:47
Listen where is computers in this particular PLC? What stage is computers
1:04:54
or say laptops? Let's say laptops. Where where is laptop in the PLC? Which stage
1:04:58
is laptop in the PLC? depend upon
1:05:02
uh is what is a which type of laptop? What are you talking about?
1:05:06
Maybe a MacBook is always Apple laptop is not a product. It is a
1:05:10
brand. Apple laptop is not a product. It is a
1:05:14
brand. Thank you, man.
1:05:17
Yes or no? Yes.
1:05:18
Apple laptop. Laptop is the product. Apple laptop is a brand.
1:05:23
Okay. Samsung laptop is a brand. So, you don't
1:05:26
even know what is the difference between a product and a brand. That is the
1:05:29
bigger problem. Apple laptop is a it's not a product. It's a brand that will
1:05:35
have a life cycle. If Apple does good marketing, it'll go up. If it does bad
1:05:39
marketing, it'll come down. But what we are talking about here, not the brand
1:05:42
life cycle. We are talking about the product life cycle. Now tell me where is
1:05:47
laptop as a product here? Still in growth.
1:05:49
Growth. How many of you say growth? Okay. Maturity.
1:05:54
Decline. Nobody's saying it is in decline.
1:05:58
Anybody saying it is an introduction? I am saying
1:06:03
it is an introduction. Okay. Nobody knows. He is saying it is
1:06:09
growth. He's saying it is decline or possibly maturity. How will I like even
1:06:13
like do a strategy when you do not even know where it is. Let me ask a simple
1:06:18
question. This is time. Listen all of you. This is time. And this is what
1:06:25
faith. Yes. Before that, where is television here in
1:06:30
the stages? Television, TV, where is it?
1:06:38
Huh? All of them. Okay. So then how do you
1:06:41
use this framework? Well, now he has realized that it is you
1:06:46
cannot use it. Where is television in? Hey, keep the phone away. Where is TV
1:06:50
in? It's growth. Okay. What are you saying?
1:06:54
Decline. Decline. You never know which is the
1:06:57
top. So you so
1:07:01
so where where is television in this? What stage is the TV in? Tell me.
1:07:06
Maturity. I am saying introduction. He's saying
1:07:10
maturity. He's she's saying decline. You're saying growth and then
1:07:13
introduction. So all of us can strategize on some stupid way.
1:07:18
Now listen when was who invented the television? Anybody?
1:07:24
Huh? Isaac Newton. Who invented the television? Anyone
1:07:35
Graham boss? That's a telephone. Okay. So, John Lugie Bird. Don't Google.
1:07:41
Simply don't Google. Okay. A person called as JL Bird. Okay. A person called
1:07:47
as JL Bird. He invented the television. Listen. He invented the television in
1:07:52
1926. Okay. Next year it is going to be the
1:07:56
centinary year of television. Okay. Today it is 2025.
1:08:00
Okay. Anniversary.
1:08:02
And it's a 100 year anniversary. Okay. 2025. Listen. So 19 Listen from 1926 to
1:08:09
2025. Yes. That is the time I have written the
1:08:14
time. What is the sales all about? with sales. Whose sales?
1:08:21
Whose sales? When you're plotting this graph, you should know the sales, right?
1:08:25
What is the sales of what? Of the brand. Is it a brand life cycle
1:08:30
or a product life cycle? Then the product
1:08:33
which product how
1:08:35
which TV do you know the your TV or all the TVs?
1:08:40
Maybe. All the TV. So, do you know the sales of
1:08:43
your television? No.
1:08:45
That itself you don't know. Let's say you know at least that you know the
1:08:47
sales of your competitor's television. Maybe.
1:08:50
So do you know the sales of all televisions that are sold in Dubai?
1:08:54
Maybe. Do you know the sales of all television
1:08:56
that are sold in the world? No. No.
1:08:58
Do you know the sales of all television that have been sold in the world from
1:09:01
the day the first television was sold? Of
1:09:02
course. Then that is the sales that they are
1:09:05
looking at. Then how do you draw this graph?
1:09:10
That is the reason why you cannot also predict where is the television in. But
1:09:15
like then like why do everybody use the PLC? Ah that is what I'm also asking.
1:09:19
You asked the question before me. Why do everybody use?
1:09:23
Oh here Jax good. Enjoy.
1:09:26
Thank you. Okay. Why? Tell me
1:09:31
then. Why do people use this PLC? This is the most used framework. Listen.
1:09:37
How many of your fathers are like in business?
1:09:41
Your father is in business. Anybody's parents are in business here? Anybody's
1:09:46
parents are in business? Father or mother is in business. Go and ask them
1:09:50
today was what stage is your product in in the PLC? They will blindly say
1:09:57
growth, growth, growth, growth, growth, growth, growth. You have to say growth
1:10:00
growth growth growth growth growth growth. Keep saying that it helps.
1:10:06
But both same thing product or service it will they will simply say it is
1:10:10
growth growth growth. Why? because it is easy. Okay. Are if anybody
1:10:16
is going to come and say no no boss my product is in decline. Okay. Will like
1:10:20
you get any funding? Okay. Will you get any funding? Can you even predict? Okay.
1:10:26
Can you even use this PLC? No. You cannot even say where the product is in.
1:10:33
You cannot say where the product is in. Now what is the problem? Every marketer
1:10:37
uses the PLC and using this they strategize wrong. I'll tell you like
1:10:40
what happened with the television. Listen. Now if you look at the
1:10:44
television, okay, if you look at the actual PLC of a television, okay, so
1:10:49
this is like a time sales over time. If you look at the actual PLC of the
1:10:55
television, it will possibly look not look like that. It will look like this.
1:10:58
It started in 1926. It will actually possibly look like
1:11:12
this. From 1926 to 1955, if you look at the television,
1:11:18
it was possibly not picking up at all. Okay? Why? Not that because people did
1:11:23
not want to have television. Keep the phones away. Listen. Okay? Because it
1:11:27
was not a supply demand side problem. It was a supply side problem. Because you
1:11:31
cannot just simply have television alone. you need a transmission lines to
1:11:35
transmit the information. Okay. So what had happened was people from 1926 to
1:11:41
1955 they were not actually even buying the TVs. Okay. They were not even
1:11:46
actually buying the TVs. Okay. From 1955 onwards okay it is when the transmission
1:11:52
lines were laid every everywhere and 1955 television almost reached Europe.
1:11:56
Finland, Sweden and all started to have television. Then it started to grow grow
1:12:00
grow grow grow grow grow grow grow grow. Okay. 1971 it reached Asia, U India, all
1:12:06
these other places. Then it started to grow grow grow. In 1995
1:12:11
there was a dip worldwide there was a dip in the television.
1:12:16
Okay. So the moment there is a dip in any of this particular product. Okay.
1:12:21
The PLC says that oh boss when the decline has happened. Okay. The PLC says
1:12:26
that like boss you have to sell the business off. Okay. And you have to move
1:12:30
away. So what happened? Very big companies. Okay. Keep your laptops off.
1:12:36
What are you watching? Okay. Very big companies. Okay. Like the
1:12:45
RCA, the Radio Corporation of America and Granding. Do you know about
1:12:50
Granding? This was a brand. Almost all the
1:12:55
televisions in Europe were sold by Granding once upon a time. Okay. like um
1:13:01
almost all the televisions in 1970s and all every TV was branding made such a
1:13:07
very big company all these companies sold their
1:13:11
businesses and left only one company said that like was no no we do not think
1:13:16
that the television is in declined and we are going to innovate what was that
1:13:20
company Toshiba
1:13:28
okay Toshiba was the company which said that like no no boss television is not
1:13:32
in decline. We do not agree that the television is in decline and we are
1:13:35
going to innovate and what they did was they innovated and they brought in the
1:13:40
cathode they brought in the panel television the CRT tube television that
1:13:45
was declining that product form was declining but a new product form emerged
1:13:51
and that made sure that this television is growing as simple as that. Do all of
1:13:57
you have a TV in your host rooms? Yes. You might not even use it, but there is
1:14:01
a TV. And how do you say the product is in decline? Earlier I used to have one
1:14:07
television in my room. In my home, entire home, there used to be one
1:14:11
television that was in the hall. Yes. Today I have a nephew who like 5 years
1:14:18
old. His entire life revolves around dinosaurs. Okay. And there is one
1:14:24
channel that 24/7 plays dinosaurs. My mom, she wants to watch some movies or
1:14:29
like a uh sitcoms and stuff. I want to watch some news sports and stuff. Now
1:14:35
there is always a fight for the remote. Who wins?
1:14:40
The kid. Okay. It has to just to throw a tantrum. Okay. All of us will be running
1:14:44
for cover. Okay. So now like there is a television for my mom in her room. I
1:14:50
have a TV in my room. Okay. There is a TV in the hall for the kid. So, three
1:14:56
televisions are there in one home where there were like one television earlier.
1:15:00
And how do you know that the television is declining?
1:15:04
Somebody said the television is declining. How do you how can you say
1:15:07
the television is declining? More and more TVs are purchased.
1:15:10
So, you can never say that like the TV is declining. Okay, it will change its
1:15:15
form. But there is no depth for a product. Okay, why? because the product
1:15:20
is a not a living thing. That's the problem.
1:15:26
So you can never strategize with the help of a PLC.
1:15:31
You can never strategize with everybody's going to jet. Huh? Where are
1:15:35
you going to? So how many days of Jex thing?
1:15:40
Internship. Huh? Oh, you're in the internship. Okay,
1:15:43
listen. Are you able to get it? Okay. Are you
1:15:46
able to get it? So like what happens is like you who like go through oh see now
1:15:52
like can you then like not use the PLC at all you cannot okay then why do every
1:15:58
marketer use it because it is super easy you all you have to say is like boss you
1:16:03
have to say boss I'm in growth growth growth growth growth okay and you will
1:16:07
be easily able to all of you have this dopamine addiction give me I'm taking
1:16:12
the phone away okay I don't it's an Apple phone right I don't have Apple
1:16:14
phone I will take it huh useless those fellows. Okay. Uh everybody
1:16:21
10 minutes you will have withdrawal symptoms if you remove the phone for
1:16:25
like 1 hour. Okay. Will you have withdrawal symptoms?
1:16:27
I don't use I don't you don't use it.
1:16:30
I don't. Huh?
1:16:32
He wants to. Yes. So what
1:16:34
are you able to get it? So what you can do then you can just
1:16:39
predict where the product is in. That's the maximum you can do. So for example
1:16:44
in this particular stage in the introduction stage there'll be one
1:16:48
player it is like a virus spreading there'll be one player okay and there'll
1:16:52
be some consumers then when you go to the growth stage
1:16:58
there'll be at least 10 players with so much of augmentation happening
1:17:06
in the maturity stage what happens is there will be two or three players that
1:17:10
will consolidate okay And finally in the decline stage there will be one player
1:17:15
who will be sitting even they will consultate one player will be sitting
1:17:18
for the product to die but as I said as long as there is augumentation you know
1:17:24
okay there is nothing called as a market maturity so when till like you're
1:17:28
auggmenting you can extend extend extend extend there is nothing called as a
1:17:32
market maturity this is why PLC is a very bad cycle very bad framework to
1:17:38
strategize are you able to get it yeah but that's infinite Yes, that's why
1:17:43
like you cannot use the PLC, that is what I have been arguing. Okay, then if
1:17:47
you cannot strategize on the basis of PLC, how do you strategize?
1:17:52
That we'll see in the next class. Okay, so if you cannot strategize, how do you
1:17:57
strategize? We will see in the next class. Okay.
1:17:59
Can I use this for my product? You cannot. What is your product?
1:18:04
Uh diffusers. Huh?
1:18:05
Diffusers. Diffusers. Tell me what stage is the
1:18:07
diffuser in introduction. Uh we do not even know. Possibly it is
1:18:11
in death. Okay. Decline. Okay. So like we never know why do you have to use it
1:18:17
when it is a stupid framework. We can have better frameworks to
1:18:21
strategize that we will see in the next class. Take care.
1:18:24
Thank useless fellows. So we'll see tomorrow.

How do brands succeed in retail?
21/10/2025 | 02:30 PM - 04:00 PM
Dr. Bhupesh Manoharan
0:00
I was like, um, my name is All right. Okay, great.
0:13
So, how was the global Jex? It was good. It was big. Fine. Okay. It was good. Did
0:19
you make like uh any collaborations and stuff?
0:23
We got internship from the Armenian government.
0:26
No, you got the internship. Okay. How much are they paying you?
0:29
going to find out. Okay, good.
0:33
Okay, great. Good. So, let's come back. Okay.
0:43
So, when is your Diwali party on like uh Sunday?
0:47
Monday or Sunday? Sunday.
0:48
Oh, Sunday is your party. Somebody said like it's Monday. Fine. Because anyways,
0:53
I'm free. Okay. for this weekend. Okay. I'm thought thinking of coming to myriad
0:56
and see like what you people are doing there. Okay. So great. But if you want
1:02
to discuss on anything any of your ideas and stuff. So I'm free for the next 3 4
1:07
days. Okay. So you can just talk to me anytime. Okay.
1:12
Great. Let's try to so why is so much of attendance today
1:25
because of Ankur's assessment okay so I think then one quiz
1:31
should be kept every day okay and that is what you people are against okay
1:35
that's fine okay I also don't feel that like there should be a lot of
1:40
exams but like how do we then like assess you. Okay, that is another
1:44
question. Great. So, what have we seen so far? Okay, so we s we saw like what
1:51
is a marketing mix? What is a product? What are the different levels of a
1:56
product? What are the different types of a product? And what is the difference
2:00
between product and services? And of course, finally, like we saw how you
2:05
should not strategize. You should not strategize on the basis of a PLC, right?
2:10
Okay. Then how do you strategize? Now what did we see as strategy? What is
2:15
strategy? You should not
2:18
a product life cycle. So this is where like huh?
2:22
No. Okay. Because I took almost 1 hour to finish that. Okay. So you go and like
2:28
watch the recording. So I'm not going to do any recap. Okay. So what is strategy?
2:32
I told you how do you increase stakeholder value? Okay. How do you
2:38
increase like what is the stakeholder value here? profits. How do you make a
2:42
lot of money, okay, with the product in uncertain
2:48
conditions? Okay, so that is exactly what we saw as strategy, right? Strategy
2:52
is nothing but a collective a series of collective steps. Okay,
2:58
that you take for what? To maximizing stakeholder
3:04
value under uncertaintity. Yes or no? How many of you were there? Huh? At
3:08
least he has written what is strategy. Okay, now great. Now, how do you
3:12
strategize that? If you're not going to strategize on the basis of a PLC, how do
3:17
you strategize? Okay, what are the product strategies?
3:21
Okay, let's try to understand now how do you make now look if you look
3:30
at if you look at product strategy, product strategy is of two types, right?
3:35
The first one is was how do you make a lot of revenue? How do you make more
3:40
revenue money
3:53
suppose there is an organization okay say everything okay so we I told you we
3:58
will be doing a product strategy a promotion strategy okay a distribution
4:04
strategy and pricing strategy means how do you create a lot of profits from all
4:10
the four Ps. Okay. So that is exactly like what we said right like yesterday
4:14
when we are talking about strategy. Fine. Okay. You can like copy later.
4:20
Wait. Okay. So anyway this topic okay you can stand alone understand but
4:25
please go and recap yesterday's topic. Yesterday's topic was very important. I
4:30
was talking about the other three Ps of marketing physical evidence process
4:33
people. Half of the class was not there. Okay,
4:39
coming back. Okay, when you are looking at product strategy, see me means I am
4:43
going to launch a product. Let's say Tetar has come up with one particular
4:47
product. What is it? The Teter BMT program. Okay. Now, how do you make a
4:53
lot of money with this particular product? That is one aspect. How do you
4:56
generate a lot of revenue? Okay, boss, you're generating a lot of revenue.
5:03
But let's say Pratan is like going with a lot of you on different yachts and
5:07
splurging the revenue. Okay. Will this particular organization survive?
5:13
No. Right. So these are the two things. The first thing is all about how do you
5:18
not generate make more money? I'll put it in more marketing terms. How do you
5:23
generate a lot of revenue? How do you generate
5:28
more revenue? The second thing is all about how do you
5:35
utilize that revenue. If you're able to do both of this okay then like what we
5:40
can say is like you will be able to make money also and use that money. Okay. So
5:46
that like you are able to ensure that the organization sustains. Okay. The
5:52
organization sustains. Okay. So how do you
6:01
utilize the revenue?
6:07
Okay. So this is where okay we call this entire thing okay we call this entire
6:12
action of product strategy as something called as a product planning exercise.
6:19
Okay, see when you are going to start a business, okay, it's okay to start a
6:25
business with one product. That's exactly how you will come up with one
6:29
idea. But like any particular investor will ask you what is your product
6:33
planning. This is one question that every particular investor will ask.
6:38
Okay? Why? Because an investor looks at not the success of one product. Okay?
6:43
But how will you launch subsequent products? So you need not put it in the
6:48
pitch deck in the first idea but you have to show a road map. Okay. So oh if
6:54
you look at this product strategy this is also called as a product planning
6:58
exercise. This is called as a product planning exercise.
7:07
Now what is the objective or the principle of this product planning
7:11
exercise? Listen all of you. What is the princip what what is the objective of a
7:15
product planning exercise? Why do I like uh create a product planning exercise?
7:20
Tell me. To generate more revenue.
7:23
No, one is about generating more revenue and like utilizing the revenue. Okay,
7:26
that is not but why should I not launch one product? Why should I launch
7:30
multiple products? Anyone?
7:33
You can see which is doing best. You can see which one best resource.
7:38
No, that is fine. That is the second part. Okay. But when I said that, why
7:42
should you launch more products? Yes. Because instead of the consumer having
7:46
two options whether to buy or not they have more options of buy and not
7:51
buy. But these are different products which are going to solve different
7:54
problems, right? Why should I like launch more products?
7:57
Anyone? Anyone? Yo boss
8:03
listen keep your like headphones off. Okay. So tell me why do you launch more
8:11
products? Look at it logically. Why should you launch many products?
8:15
A higher chance of success. Okay. Uh fine. like what is the high ch
8:21
success about what you solve different
8:29
okay you s you solve different needs okay
8:33
so you have more offer to your clients if you buy the phone
8:39
but you have a very hero product okay a flagship product a lot of people are
8:43
buying this product why should you launch more products
8:45
maybe stop buying that product that's the thing that product can
8:50
possibly become obsolete. If you do not innovate that product can
8:55
die. Okay. But can a product die? Yesterday what did we say? A product can
9:01
never die. But suppose the product can go out of trend. So at that time you
9:08
should survive. Okay. So this product planning exercise
9:13
is not about the survival of a product. It is never about the survival of one
9:17
product. It is about the survival of an organization or the sustainability of an
9:22
organization. Okay. An organization should sustain. The BMT program we might
9:27
close it down tomorrow. Okay. But Tedar as an organization should sustain. That
9:32
is why there should be multiple programs and the multiple programs are the
9:35
multiple products in the areble to get it. It is not about sustainability of
9:40
that particular product. Right? It is all about the sustainability of the
9:46
organization. This is the principle of a product
9:54
planning exercise. Okay. Why do you do a product planning exercise? You do a
9:58
product planning exercise. Okay. Why? Because this particular organizations
10:03
should sustain. That is why when you're going to an investor, they're asking for
10:06
a product planning exercise. Okay. Why? Because you are coming up with an idea.
10:11
That idea might flop. But when I'm going to put some money into this particular
10:15
business, will this business sustain? Will this business sustain? Or like if
10:20
this idea fails also, can these guys pivot? Okay. And give me returns. This
10:25
is what an investor is looking at. An investor is not going to trust you on
10:29
the basis of that one idea. Of course, that one idea has a lot of weight, but
10:32
they are going to trust you who you are as a human being. Can you do that
10:36
pivoting? Can you launch multiple products? This is exactly what is the
10:40
test that they are going to do. Okay. When you're going when they are going to
10:43
like look at whether they have to fund your business or not. Keep your phones
10:47
away please. Okay. Are you able to get it? Are you
10:53
able to get it? So you are looking at okay you're looking at okay the
10:57
sustainability of an organization not the sustainability of an idea. But when
11:03
will an organization sustain? When will an organization sustain? When there is a
11:07
lot of money. Yes. Okay. There's a lot of money that is coming in but I'm using
11:12
this money useless manner. Will that organization sustain? No. So you have to
11:17
generate a lot of money and you have to use that money. Well, so for both of
11:21
this we are going to study two frameworks. One is about how do you
11:25
generate a lot of money. The second one is all about how do you use that money
11:30
effectively. First for the generating a lot of revenue. How do you
11:36
generate more revenue? Okay, this is where like we are going to study one
11:40
matrix called as the ansofts matrix. And how do you utilize the revenue? We
11:48
are going to study one matrix called as the BCG matrix.
11:53
Okay. Now what is this ansoft matrix? This ansoft's matrix was given by an
11:59
individual called Igor Ansoff. It was given by an Austrian Igor Ansoff.
12:08
Now what does this ANSOS matrix say? It's a simple 2x2. But like we have to
12:14
understand this 2x2 well. Okay.
12:23
Now what does the Sans of matrix say? Okay. The Sans matrix it is a product
12:27
planning exercise. How the principle is very simple. How do I generate more
12:31
money? How do I generate more money? Now, how can you generate more money?
12:35
Logically, tell me, how can you generate more money? Tell me, you're having a
12:39
product. How can you generate more money with the product? Sell more of it. Okay?
12:44
Or sell to more people. Both the things are there, right? You have to sell more
12:49
of the product to the same person or possibly you have to sell to more people
12:55
or you can like sell new new products. Yes or no?
12:59
Now that is why if you look at the axis of this Ansource matrix, if you look at
13:05
the axis of the Ansource matrix, one axis of the Ansource matrix, this is
13:09
what is called as product. This axis is nothing but a product axis.
13:15
Okay, this axis is called as the market axis. What is the meaning of market?
13:22
Who's sitting in the market? Consumers. As simple as that. Market is
13:27
nothing but the consumers. Now the product can be an existing
13:37
product. The product can be an existing product
13:43
or the product can be a new product. See I have to make more money boss. I
13:51
have one product. I can more make more money from that product or I can launch
13:55
new products. Yes or no? Similarly, I have to generate money. I can make money
14:01
from my existing consumers or I can make money from my new consumers. Yes or no?
14:07
Yes. So the thing is that I am going to make money I'm going to make money from
14:12
my existing consumers or I'm going to make money from my new
14:19
consumers. Yes.
14:22
Yes or no? Okay, great. Now listen, you have an existing product. You have
14:30
an existing product. For example, I have this pen and our George is my existing
14:38
consumer. He's already using the pen. Now, how do I generate more money from
14:43
George? Tell me. What is the meaning of upselling?
14:49
Selling more products. Then you're changing the product. Okay. It is not
14:52
the uh you're selling more products. What do you mean by that?
14:58
For example, you chase one of the products and you operate in
15:03
complimentary. No, that's then you're changing the
15:05
product. That's wrong. Think about it. It is not an existing product. The same
15:09
pen alone. Okay. I listen all of you. He's having a pen. Okay. This is my
15:14
product and I have to and George is already using the pen but I have to
15:19
generate more money from him. How will I do it? It's not about bringing in a new
15:22
product. Then you go to the different quadrant.
15:25
Huh? They are different products, right?
15:29
Okay. Subscription.
15:31
Huh? Like a subscription.
15:33
Subscription. Okay. Means. Okay. Bundle of pens. Okay. I'll take
15:37
it. Okay. Bundle of pens or subscription?
15:40
Subscription. H
15:43
refill. Okay. You need to make the cons. You're
15:46
saying like refill or subscription or more pens. Yes. say the same thing or if
15:50
not like no give it damaging. Okay. Now
15:55
you buy more. Okay. No, don't change the price. We are
15:59
not changing the price. Okay. Now listen, there is an existing product and
16:04
there is an existing consumer. There you are. There's a product and the consumer
16:08
is already using it. Okay. How do we make more money from the consumer? Very
16:13
simple. Huh? No, we are not improving the product.
16:17
Okay. What these three people said, what is it called as? You make the consumer
16:22
consume more. As simple as that. Okay, make the consumer consume more. Okay, so
16:28
earlier the consumer was buying like one pen. Okay, you make them buy five pens.
16:33
Okay, either through subscription or like through creating a bundle or
16:37
whatever it is. Okay, so this is what is called as a market penetration strategy.
16:52
This is what is called as a market penetration strategy. What is it? You
16:58
make the consumer consume a lot more of the same product. Okay, I'll give you an
17:03
example. Yesterday I was talking about right. So in my home when I was young,
17:08
okay, when I was young, there was only one television in my home. Okay, why?
17:13
because the entire family used to watch in that television. Today
17:17
what is happening? Okay. So I have a nephew who I said that
17:23
he's 5 years old. He wants to always watch some dinosaurs movie and there is
17:27
one channel which always shows dinosaurs. My mom wants to watch a lot
17:32
of sitcoms, dramas kind of a thing. And I want to watch some sports or news or
17:36
other stuff. Okay. Movies. Okay. Now there is always a fight for the remote.
17:40
Now who wins in this fight? Mom.
17:43
No. Nephew. The child only wins. He has to
17:47
throw one tantrum and all of us will be running for covers. Okay. So he always
17:52
wins the remote. Okay. So what do I do now? Okay. I have now purchased a TV for
17:56
my own bedroom. My mom has a bed a TV in her bedroom and
18:01
there is a television in the hall. Now the same consumer. Okay. There is the
18:05
same consumer. Now like have you made the consumer consume more?
18:09
Okay. This is what is market penetration strategy. Tomorrow you can say put one
18:13
TV in the toilet, put TV in the bathroom. So even when you're going into
18:16
the bathroom, okay, you can always keep the match can keep on going. Okay, so
18:20
you'll not miss the goal. Okay, are you able to get it? Okay, so existing
18:25
product, existing market, okay, means existing product, existing consumer. If
18:30
you're going to make more money from them, make the consumer consume more.
18:33
For example, how many of you would drink cola from a Coca-Cola from a pet bottle?
18:38
the big 2 liter bottle. Okay, at least you buy that, right?
18:43
Earlier when I was young, okay, there were the bottle used to be just a 300 ml
18:48
and you have to go to the shop. We will buy there in the glass. Okay, we will
18:52
drink and we'll keep the bottle and come back. Okay, because it's a glass bottle,
18:56
right? Okay, now what did they do? Okay, they converted the glass bottle, okay,
19:00
to a large PET bottle. So, 2 liters or five liters, you buy it and keep it. So
19:05
whenever you're opening the refrigerator ah Coca-Cola Coca-Cola okay so you have
19:10
made the consumer consume a lot more of the same product are you able to get it
19:15
okay for example if you look at cereals in India
19:20
the mothers always had this notion okay that like they have to get up at 5:00 in
19:25
the morning burn their fingers and like make something called as a paratha only
19:28
that that is when like they are considered they were considered as good
19:31
moms what did Kelloggs come and say kell Delux came and told okay boss you know
19:36
you're a good mother okay but there are more nutrients are needed for your kid
19:41
okay and we have mineral based or vitamin based cereals and you just put
19:47
some cereals so people used to have cereals once in a week
19:53
then two days in a week then 3 days today the mom is sleeping every child is
19:57
like just putting like some cereals adding milk drinking and going okay the
20:01
same product same consumer they have made it consume more. Are you able to
20:06
get it? Okay. So when I was a child, okay,
20:14
I used to eat chocolates only for my birthdays. Then like what happened? Oh,
20:19
every day is a celebration. You can eat it every day. Then what is there for
20:24
desert? Okay, chocolates. Okay, so this is exactly what is a market penetration
20:30
strategy. existing product, existing market, okay? And like a if you're able
20:37
to make more money from the existing product with the existing consumers,
20:40
then that is what is market penetration strategy. Believe me folks, okay, in
20:45
Harvard Business School, this one framework is taught as a 20our course.
20:48
I'm not even exaggerating. You can go and check, okay? Like the online this
20:54
AMSO's matrix alone is taught as a 20our course in Harvard. I am going to teach
20:58
this in 45 minutes. Okay? because you have to understand the foundations of
21:02
it. Okay. And that is more than sufficient. Okay. So, possibly like 45
21:06
minutes or 1 hour, we'll see. Are you able to get this logic? Okay. So,
21:10
existing product then from an with an existing product existing consumers.
21:15
Okay. How do you make more money? Okay. You're making more money using something
21:19
called as a market penetration strategy. Market penetration strategy. Yes.
21:26
uh I don't usually penetration like whether
21:30
existing product no that is penetration pricing that is
21:33
penetration pricing okaysoft did not use the penetration in the same way okay
21:38
that's penetration pricing we'll come to that when we are doing pricing are you
21:41
able to get this now so how did you do this how did you do this made the
21:46
consumer consume more so did you change the product
21:49
no you have not changed the product so how can you do this you can do this by
21:58
changing all the other six piece but okay I'm not going to come to that I'll
22:02
come to that later are you able to get it okay now listen now there is an
22:06
existing product there is an existing product but you have to sell to new
22:13
consumers there is an existing product but you
22:16
have to sell to new consumers okay how do you do that
22:23
what is that called expansion
22:26
expansion okay so existing product but you have to sell to new consumers what
22:31
you're doing is okay you are expanding or developing the market okay and that
22:36
is why this is called as a market development strategy
22:56
That is why this strategy is called as a market development strategy. Now what is
23:01
market development? Okay, a market development strategy is where like a
23:05
there's an existing product. There's an existing product but you're taking it to
23:10
new markets. Okay, you're taking it to new markets. So then this strategy is
23:14
what is called as a market development strategy. Now if you look at market
23:18
development strategy, market development is of two types.
23:23
One type of market development is what is called as a a geographic market
23:29
development. The second type of market development is
23:36
what is called as a segmentbased market development.
23:43
Okay. There are two types of market development strategies. One is called as
23:47
a geographic market development. The other type of a market development is
23:51
what is called as a segmentbased market development. Now what is this geographic
23:56
market development? For example, let us say what's your name boss?
24:02
Moes. H
24:03
Moses. Moses. Oh, that's okay. Fine. Okay. Now,
24:06
Moses or I'll take somebody else. Okay. Now, let us say our boy. Okay. No,
24:11
because I wanted to take a product such that Okay. And Moses was a very
24:14
different difficult name to use. Okay. Suppose like our boy is launching let's
24:20
say halal meat. Okay. So that is the thing. Okay. Now like let's say our boy
24:24
was launching halal meat in like a Yeah. You are from Saudi Arabia, right? Okay.
24:30
So what's your name? Boss. I don't know most of your names.
24:34
You put your tag. I'll be able to call you.
24:37
Huh? Mohammed. Okay. So our boy was like launching. Okay.
24:42
say halal meet where in Saudi Arabia he is launched. Okay.
24:49
Now suppose our boy is trying to take this halal meat and he's going to sell
24:54
it in Canada or say Venezuela same brand okay same
25:00
product he's going to a different market then that is what is called as a
25:05
geographic market development. That is what is called as a geographic market
25:10
development. You are same product but you're going to sell to new consumers.
25:14
Okay. Then that is what is called as a geographic market development. Okay
25:18
boss. Now listen suppose in Saudi Arabia. Okay. Let us
25:25
say in Saudi Arabian market let us say this is the consumers that are consume
25:29
halal meat. Okay. Why? Because it is tasty.
25:36
Okay. This is one group of individuals who are saying that like boss we are
25:40
going to consume only halal meat because it is tasty. Now what is our boy going
25:44
to say is boss like yes but halal meat is also religiously sacred. Okay. So
25:53
what is our boy doing is there are other group of individuals. I do not care
25:56
about tasty food. Okay. But I have want to have a religiously sacred food. Now
26:01
what he is going to do is he is going to reposition this as is yes it's also
26:06
tasty but it is also religiously sacred. Then like what he has done is he has
26:11
gone for a different consumer base. Okay in the same geography are able to get it
26:18
in the same geography he has gone for a different segment. Okay in the same
26:23
geography has gone for a different segment. Okay. So then this is what is
26:27
called as a segmentbased market development. Are you able to get the
26:31
difference? Are you able to get the difference? There was one stupid brand
26:34
in India. Okay. So this was started by one guru.
26:40
Okay. This brand was called as Patentali. Okay. Uh this brand was
26:44
called as Patentali. And what did he say? So he he was using this particular
26:49
patenti brand and he used to launch a lot of FMCG products. Okay. And he
26:54
called this as was these products are ayurvedic
26:59
and that is why you have to consume ayurvedic products. Okay. A ayurvedic is
27:03
nothing but like a it's a herbal product. Okay. So now like the same
27:08
potental toothpaste if he is going to like take it to let us say like a USA or
27:14
Japan then that is geographic market development. Okay that is geographic
27:19
market development. But what did he he did that okay he did that he took patri
27:23
toothpaste to different countries that's a geographic market development same
27:26
product he has not changed the product same product but you're trying to take
27:29
it to different consumers different geographies but what did he do in India
27:35
what did he do was he said that was this is ayurvedic or dii but this is also
27:41
nationalistic because it's an Indian product so you have to buy Indian and uh
27:46
so you are as an Indian you have to buy only Indian products so What did he do
27:50
was he moved this from Ayurvedic to also nationalistic.
28:00
So what happened? Okay, all those people okay there were some people I do not
28:04
care about Ayurvedic or the herbal product but this is a nationalistic
28:08
product. This is my country's product so I will buy it. Okay. So you got in a
28:13
different set of consumers buying the same product. Are you able to get it?
28:17
You got in a different set of consumers buying the same product. Yes.
28:21
So when they do this, do they now like give it to both or
28:25
Yes, you sell it to both. Okay. You sell it to both. And when you're selling it
28:28
to both, okay, the only thing is that when you're moving for the segment based
28:32
market development, when you're moving for the segment based market
28:35
development, you have to ensure okay you have to ensure that there is only one
28:40
thing. Okay. What is that? The previous segment should not feel upset by the
28:46
kind of a positioning change that you're making. Are you able to get it? The
28:49
previous segment should not be upset because of the newer narrative that
28:53
you're making. Okay? Or the newer positioning change that you're making.
28:56
Are you able to get this logic? Okay. So, how do you do this? Listen, how do
29:01
you do this? Then in this case, you can in this case you can change all the six
29:09
piece apart from product. You can change okay the distribution promotion pricing
29:14
in physical evidence process people okay you can change all the six piece in this
29:19
case what you're doing is you're changing the positioning
29:26
of course not just the positioning here you're changing the segmentation
29:39
targeting positioning along with the six piece except for the product. Okay, you
29:43
can change the segment itself. You can change the positioning itself. Okay, so
29:48
that this is the reason why I told you this course is taught for like a almost
29:52
20 hours in Harvard. Okay, because how do you do all of these nuanced changes?
29:57
Okay, it is like this boss tar tetar is starting this particular pro
30:03
tar dubai is there. Okay, teter is starting this particular program. Now
30:07
Tedar BMT if they're going to launch a Tetar BMT in Geneva okay instead of
30:14
Dubai if they're going to Geneva to start a new school okay then that is
30:18
what is called as a geographic market development that is what is called as a
30:24
geographic market development. Yes. Now what is a segment based market
30:28
development? Why have all of you come here? Why have all of you come here for
30:32
this business management program? What was the positioning that they said? You
30:36
can build your own business. So your segment is all about
30:40
you build your own business. But in ter Dubai itself they saying boss you can
30:44
come even if you do not build your business it is okay but like we will get
30:47
you jobs. That's a different segment okay that they can like launch in Dubai
30:52
itself. Okay. So then that is what is called as a segment based market
30:57
development. In both the ways tettor can make more money. Are you able to get
31:00
this logic? Are you able to get this logic? Any questions?
31:06
Yes. Which one?
31:15
Square plus
31:18
6P. It's STP plus 6P. Okay. It's the six
31:22
other piece of marketing. What is STP?
31:25
Segmentation, targeting, positioning. Jesus. Okay, you forgot.
31:30
Okay. STP, segmentation, targeting, positioning. The sixth piece are the
31:34
other piece. Okay. Last class you did not come I think. Okay. When I taught
31:36
the other three piece of marketing. Yeah.
31:40
Okay. You were there. Yeah.
31:41
Huh. Then we saw physical evidence process people. Right.
31:44
She was in Jex. She Oh, she were in Jexa. Okay.
31:48
Okay. Great. Now are you able to get this? Okay. Great. Now,
31:56
how do you make more money from the existing
32:01
consumers but with a new product? If you're going to make more money from the
32:07
existing consumer, existing consumer but with a new product. Okay? Then this is
32:12
what is called as a product development strategy. This is what is called as a
32:18
product development strategy. Okay, this is what is called as a
32:33
product development strategy. And which brand does a product development
32:36
strategy very well? The brand that you are using?
32:39
Apple. Apple. Okay. So you look at Apple first.
32:42
What did they do? They launched one product to you. What is it?
32:45
iPhone. Yeah. iPhone. Fine. The moment you
32:49
started to use the iPhone, then they knew, okay boss, like you are a consumer
32:53
who's using the iPhone, then they pushed an iPad, then they pushed an laptop,
33:01
then they pushed a particular earpods, AirPods, okay, then what are the other
33:08
things now? Like they possibly saying Vision Pro. Okay, the same consumer.
33:13
Okay, but you're going to make more money. Okay, we are going to make more
33:17
money from the same consumer. Okay, then this is what is called as a product
33:22
development strategy. You are developing new products, okay, in order to make
33:26
money from the same consumers. Okay, are you able to get it? This is what is
33:30
called as a product development strategy. How can Teter do a product
33:33
development strategy? Existing consumer, okay, existing product you have BMT.
33:39
Now, how can like a tetar make more money?
33:43
like no
33:46
see you are the existing consumer from this existing consumer okay I have to
33:51
launch new products to make money okay how can I do that
33:55
the course huh the AI course
33:58
okay the AR course okay the summer camps or what else huh
34:04
mast's how is mast's union here mast's program
34:07
oh mast's program of course mast's program okay so suppose if you're still
34:12
foolish enough okay after 4 years want to do two more years of masters you can
34:16
come here okay so that is exactly what tetra will say right okay so what have
34:20
they done here they are going to possibly not change the positioning okay
34:26
they're not going to change the consumer okay but they are going to possibly
34:29
launch okay different products so they can play on all the seven piece
34:36
okay here I've changed the product as well they can play on all the seven
34:39
piece you know what are the seven piece right some of you are looking very
34:42
scared Okay. What are the seven Ps?
34:45
Price, promotion. Ah, product,
34:48
placemotion, price,
34:52
promotion, not packaging and all. Okay, physical evidence,
34:58
process, process and people. Okay, last class
35:01
only we saw all of this. Uh, if you missed the class, this is
35:06
what happens. This is the three Ps and these were the original four Ps.
35:12
Okay. So that form the seven piece of marketing. Are you able to get it? Are
35:17
you able to get it? Okay. So you have an existing consumer. Okay. But you're
35:23
going to launch new products to the existing consumer and you're going to
35:26
make money. Yes. So in the one six piece is because
35:30
you're sticking product product. No. In this six piece except
35:34
for product. Okay. You can change all the six piece to make like more money.
35:39
Okay. Okay. takes the per product you can
35:41
change all the six piece to make more money. How 200 ml to like a 500 ml or
35:47
like bundle two products and like a sell it for like a slightly higher price.
35:52
Okay. Or increase the price. Okay. So here you have you can change all the
35:57
seven keys. Okay. You can change all the seven keys because it's a new product as
36:00
well. Are you able to get it? Are you able to get it?
36:04
Any questions? Okay, great. Now, how do you
36:15
make more money from new consumers with the new products? What do you do? New
36:22
consumers with the new products. Market consumers.
36:27
Okay. So, that is what is called as diversification strategy. When you're
36:32
going to make more money from new consumers with the new products, then
36:38
this is what is called as a diversification strategy.
36:50
If you look at diversification, diversification is of two types. Okay,
36:54
diversification again is of two types. One is called as a related
36:59
diversification strategy. The other one is called as an unrelated
37:05
diversification strategy. One is called as a related
37:11
diversification strategy. The other one is called as an unrelated
37:14
diversification strategy. Okay. Now what is this related and unrelated
37:19
diversification? First what is diversification? When you are going to
37:23
launch okay new products to new consumers. Okay. Then that is what is
37:28
called as a diversification strategy. That is what is called as a
37:31
diversification strategy. Now for example, let me take this example
37:35
Coca-Cola. Okay, Coca-Cola. How many of you here in
37:39
this class? Okay, do not drink a Coca-Cola
37:43
or any of the school drinks or Okay, why boss? Why do you not drink a Coca-Cola?
37:48
You I don't like it.
37:50
Okay. What is the reason why you don't you like don't like the taste?
37:53
I don't like the taste. I don't like the gas. I don't like the color fish, the
37:56
color sweet. Okay. It it's unhealthy. Okay,
37:59
wonderful. Okay, that is the right person I wanted. Okay, now like she is
38:04
not an existing consumer of Coca-Cola. But co as Coca-Cola, I want to like make
38:10
money from her. Okay, I want to make money from her. You tell me how will you
38:14
make money from you're the Coca-Cola CEO.
38:16
Coke Zero. Coke Zero. Okay. But Coke Zero is also
38:19
Coke. Sell water.
38:20
Huh? Sell water.
38:21
Yeah. Sparkling water. Sell water. Okay. Or what did Coca-Cola
38:25
do? because like she's a health conscious consumer, right? She's a
38:29
health conscious consumer. Okay? So she will definitely not buy Coca-Cola. So in
38:34
such a case like what do you do? What do you do? Coca-Cola came up with something
38:38
called as a vitamin water. Okay. How many of you know about vitamin water?
38:42
How many of you have drunk the vitamin water of Coca-Cola?
38:46
Okay. Now Coca-Cola, you you have drunk the
38:51
vitamin water [ __ ] Okay. Like now if you look at it that nonsense was
38:58
if you look at that was more horrible. Okay. If you look at Coca-Cola for 100
39:02
ml of Coca-Cola there were 8 g of sugar. This one for 100 ml of this nonsense.
39:07
Okay. There were 12 g of sugar. It was basically costly urine coming out. Okay.
39:12
Like that is the thing. All the vitamins will anyways get excreted. Okay. Like
39:16
and it was horrible drink. But people like her went and purchased. Okay.
39:20
Because it is like healthy. Okay. It what they said was it is like a an
39:25
existing product. Uh it's like a new consumer with a new product. They went
39:31
now what this is what is this vitamin water was what was called as a related
39:36
diversification strategy. Why do you call that as a related diversification?
39:41
Anyone? Anyone tell me why is this a related diversification strategy?
39:44
They're both drinks. Huh? They're both drinks. Is that just
39:52
the company? No. Everywhere it is the same company.
39:55
This is done for one organization. Huh?
39:58
Same name. What is the meaning of it?
40:02
Like it's all like um it's a beverage. Okay. But the thing is
40:08
that but is that the only reason why it is called as related diversification?
40:11
Yes. Because consumer already knows.
40:14
No. Consumer knows even uh if they are going to launch other products also
40:18
consumer knows the thing is that the production the manufacturing okay and
40:24
distribution all this will not require much change right why this is also a
40:30
bottle that is also a bottle okay when like you're making everything in a
40:34
bottle can you do you need to change the entire distribution do you need to
40:37
change the entire production you need not okay and that is the reason why this
40:42
is called as a related diversification Now Coca-Cola went and launched the
40:47
Okay, so t-shirts. Yes, Coca-Cola made t-shirts. Okay,
40:52
suppose like we can she buy the t-shirt? She's not the existing Coca-Cola
40:56
consumer, but can she buy the t-shirt? Yes or no? Okay, then like I am
41:01
launching a new product to a very very very new consumer. Okay, then that is
41:06
what is called as an unrelated diversification. I'm going to
41:11
launch a completely new product to a very very very new consumer. Okay. Then
41:16
this is what is called as an unrelated diversification. This is what is called
41:20
as an unrelated diversification. Why? Because the production distribution and
41:26
okay and um of course the the finances everything is very very very very
41:32
different and that is why it is called as an unrelated diversification. Are you
41:35
able to get it? Are you able to get it? Now listen,
41:43
I want you to look at this entire thing. Which is the
41:52
most difficult thing to do? Okay. Which is the most difficult thing
41:58
to do? Without
42:03
h diversification.
42:06
Okay. I'll give you first 2 minutes time. Okay. If you are pratam metal, can
42:11
you create like an ansource matrix and come up with new
42:16
products for every bucket or like you have your own idea. Can you do a product
42:20
planning exercise for your own idea quickly
42:24
take your own idea whatever idea you wanted to launch okay quickly come up
42:28
with a product planning or like if you're if you do not have an idea of
42:31
your own it's fine. Okay. Try to do a product planning exercise for Twitter.
42:36
Now five minutes. I just have a question.
42:40
Yes. In the product development strategy if
42:43
you change the all the seven PS you also change people. And if you change people
42:48
is like no that is not the same people. The
42:50
people is here. Oh you might
42:58
you do a product planning exercise for Ta or like for your own idea. How many
43:02
of you are planning to work on your own idea? Because believe me, this is the
43:05
first question, okay, that a particular investor is going to ask you. Okay. What
43:09
is your product plan? Okay. So, or either do it for your own idea or do it
43:15
for Twitter. Right now, I'll ask one of you to come
43:22
and do it on the board. What are you doing? Asking
44:01
to have a school. Some colleges have a school.
44:04
Okay. But you think from your own head. Okay.
44:08
So for the diversification or for all the four? Oh.
44:31
All for the same. No, it is not done for a company. Oh,
44:35
folks, listen. Listen. Oh, that is a very very good question, boss. This is
44:39
done for a company. Okay, you can do this thing. It's a sustainability of an
44:45
organization. Organization. Organization. What is the meaning of it?
44:49
You can do this for one organization only. Okay. For example, you are doing
44:53
it for Teter, you can do it for Teter. Or if you're going to do it for like
44:57
Coca-Cola, you can do it for Coca-Cola. Okay. You cannot like do it for multiple
45:01
products. Okay. Multiple brands. One particular brand you have to do it. So
45:07
if you're going to come up with an idea, okay? Okay. What are your ideas? Who
45:11
said that? Okay. Who wanted to launch? What was yours? You are starting the
45:15
sports club. Uh yes.
45:18
Ah. So how will you ex create a product plan for that sports club? What was your
45:22
idea? You said that like you wanted to come up
45:25
with an idea. I have many ideas.
45:28
One idea. You tell me. Any ideas? We'll talk about that later.
45:32
Basketball. Basketball.
45:35
Okay. So for that how will you create like a product plan strategy?
45:39
Okay. Do it. right now. What about your other ideas? What do
45:48
what was your idea? Uh for example, corporate gifting.
45:52
That's what I'm doing right now. You're doing the
45:54
corporate gifting. Oh, corporate gifting. Wonderful. Try
46:08
who's doing for Twitter. Okay, you are doing for Teter. You do it
46:12
for your idea. I will ask one of you to come and like
46:17
do it on the board. Now, oh no, that is easy.
46:35
Why? For a service also it works. This thing works both for product and a
46:46
service. That is why yesterday we were talking okay there is nothing called as
46:50
a product or a service. Everything is a product plus a service.
47:17
This is augment market penetration. Augmenting the product is not
47:23
market penetration. No, you are not changing the product. It's
47:26
the same product. done.
47:56
One of you come and explain if you have done
49:15
I'll give you two more minutes. That's all.
50:59
Okay, cool. Let's continue. Who has finished?
51:09
You have done for what? For the
51:14
Okay, tell me. Okay. So for for market penetration
51:21
um just like increase the marketing of that uh of the
51:27
three tournament like gyms or like club or like schools universities.
51:32
How is that market penetration? Because I can't do anything else.
51:37
Why can't you? You can have more.
51:42
Okay. See that is the thing. The number of events
51:45
it's used to be like monthly now like I can buy weekly.
51:48
Okay. Then what is market development for development?
51:55
Uh it's only in Dubai right now. I'll do it. And
51:59
that's geographic market development. Yeah. Oh.
52:04
Yes, of course. I wanted everything. Oh, it's okay. So for penetration sorry
52:12
for development instead of only doing it for male
52:17
you can also do it for females esports football diversifying
52:23
instead of only being no that is like market development or
52:26
diversification. No no the first part of his answer is
52:30
development. If you would just uh change the segment so from male to female then
52:35
diversification is it that new consumer or existing
52:38
consumer? Then how is it like quick market
52:43
development? So you're not even thinking then.
52:47
So market development is like what 4v4 tournaments or like whatever more people
52:52
you tell me. That is what I'm asking. 6v6 or like just more people.
52:56
No that's not market development. What did I say? Market development. Same
53:01
consumer. Okay. You can market.
53:05
Oh, like okay
53:06
volleyball instead of making it a professional
53:10
basketball tournament now it's an amateur basketball tournament.
53:13
Okay. So you have both
53:15
means like then is it a new consumer or an existing consumer?
53:18
New consumer existing basketball but now market development is new consumer
53:26
existing product. But did did you say the same product?
53:29
Yeah I said so it's a 3x3
53:31
basketball women's league. Okay fine I get it. I said that you're
53:34
like I'm but that can also be like okay fine got
53:38
it okay same
53:39
okay then yeah then product development strategy
53:42
for existing would be instead of doing a 3v3 basketball I can do a 2v2 pana or
53:47
like a one boxing then for diversification entirely we can
53:51
do what he said I can start esports in Japan
53:54
okay I went from boxing in Dubai to I changed
53:58
the product a little bit I changed the job
53:59
what is a related diversification this would be
54:04
unrelated. So you're saying ask you're asking what's related. Related would be
54:09
I just do one v one football in the UK. So my marketing is still there
54:16
because I'm doing global marketing for my brand.
54:19
No the thing is that now what is the difference between a related
54:23
diversification and and a market development? That's why I asked
54:28
difference between related diversification and market development.
54:31
Diversification first of all when you're doing new product new market but your
54:37
supply doesn't change like your no okay we'll come to that okay
54:42
no it is not trick that is the reason why because everywhere the strategy is
54:46
different so you you have taken this so lightly okay it is not okay everywhere
54:51
the strategy is different okay now a 3x3 for women okay
54:58
whatever he said is that like an market develop velment or a related
55:02
diversification that depends on the chronology of like your
55:07
launch. So what is the meaning of it? Listen.
55:11
Now that's why I just wanted you to do this exercise. Okay? Because it will be
55:15
looking the same. Okay? Now if you look at everything comes down to the
55:19
chronology of this particular implementation. What is the meaning of
55:22
it? Let us say I am Apple. Let's first give let me give you an example. Now let
55:27
us say what is a market penetration strategy. I told you you can do this
55:31
only for one brand, right? Let's say like you're an Apple iPhone. Okay,
55:35
you're Apple iPhone. Okay, now if you are going to like a make sure how will
55:41
you do a market penetration strategy. How will you do a market penetration
55:45
strategy? iPhone 16. Okay, instead of making like one particular iPhone, you
55:49
say that like five iPhones are bundled together for a family. iPhone 16 for a
55:54
family. Okay, five iPhone 16s. Okay, or a couple iPhone 16. Okay. 2x2 iPhone 16.
56:00
Okay. In the place of one, that is what is a market penetration strategy. Now,
56:05
what is a market development strategy? Okay, market development strategy. If
56:10
you are going to say that like a boss, I am going to like sell this iPhone. Okay,
56:14
I'm going to sell this iPhone. Okay, not just in the US. I'm going to come to
56:18
like say Dubai. Then that is what is called as a market
56:23
development strategy, a geographic market development strategy. Now what is
56:27
the segment based market development strategy in the US market okay people
56:31
nerds are buying the iPhone okay but I am going to sell this iPhone to
56:37
entrepreneurs okay then that is what is called as a segment based market
56:41
development why can't that be a related diversification
56:45
okay says same product okay so you change positioning yes okay you're
56:51
changing just the positioning okay now that is why I said like STP plus 6P fee
56:56
I did not include the product okay when you change in the positioning that is
57:00
fine okay but you you should not change the product now what is the product
57:04
development for Apple if I'm going to launch Apple laptop and all these other
57:08
things then that is product development now what is then related diversification
57:13
if I am going to launch Apple laptop okay okay to a different consumer not my
57:20
existing consumer then that is what is called as a related diversification now
57:25
everything comes down to the chronology of this particular
57:30
launch. What is the meaning of it? Now, if you are going to be having an
57:33
existing product, listen, there is an existing product
57:41
and you are trying to take the existing product to a completely new consumer
57:49
then what is this one called as? This one is called as market development
57:54
strategy. Yes. or no existing product you're going to take to a completely new
57:58
consumer then this is a market development strategy but you are first
58:02
launching the exist existing product and there is an
58:06
existing consumer let me put it in this page
58:30
Okay, existing product you're selling to an existing consumer. This is what is
58:34
market penetration, right? But what we can do is we can launch a
58:40
new product to the existing consumer. Okay, a new product is launched to the
58:47
existing consumer then this is what is called as a product development
58:51
strategy. Okay, this is what is called as a product development strategy. Yes.
58:55
Now what you can do is if you are going to like launch a new product to a new
59:01
consumer. Okay. How do you launch a new product to a new consumer? Okay. How do
59:06
you launch a new product to a new consumer?
59:09
Marketing. of course by marketing or if you are going to launch a new product to
59:16
an existing customer first and make sure that the consumer is starting to use it.
59:22
Okay, make sure that the consumer is starting to use it then this new
59:25
consumer will come and buy this right word of mouth is that a easy strategy or
59:31
directly launching a new product to a new consumer is a easy strategy. Tell me
59:35
what is easy existing consumer
59:40
Tell me pardon.
59:48
Is it easy to launch your existing consumer? Think about it and come. We'll
59:52
take a 5 minutes break. Okay. And I'll come and explain that.
1:00:19
Let's say I have an idea a sporting brand but for women specifically. Uhhuh.
1:00:26
In this case market penetration. Well, I didn't get like what is market
1:00:31
penetration? And then market penetration is like you make the consumer consume a
1:00:35
lot more. Okay, for example. Okay, instead of like buying it once in a
1:00:39
year, you're saying boss buy every 3 months. That is what market penetration
1:00:42
is. Okay,
1:00:44
it's women's clothing brand, right? Same product, but you're making them consume
1:00:47
a lot more. Like changing colors,
1:00:52
okay? Yes.
1:00:57
Um Okay. cuz we're doing insoles, right?
1:01:02
We're doing insoles. Okay.
1:01:05
And so for related, I didn't know if I should put like different insults or
1:01:09
like something like fabric related like Oh, then that is what is that that's
1:01:13
product development uh product development.
1:01:16
Yeah, cuz that was my other question. It's like how
1:01:19
that we are coming we coming we are coming for product development and
1:01:22
diversification. That is why I said like it'll confuse.
1:01:25
Okay. Thank you. First of all, thank you for the classes that are
1:01:28
great. I wanted to have a little more clarity
1:01:32
on the difference between the related and related just the the supplier
1:01:37
because I don't think we'll see you'll see now like I'll I'll
1:01:40
come back okay once you come back from the bake I'll explain
1:01:42
okay penetration you're selling these boxes
1:01:51
for example is uh the birthday service where you take all the is that market
1:01:56
penetration or is it changing the We'll see. We'll see.
1:02:00
Adding another service, but the product itself is different.
1:02:02
Oh, no. Then the QR just a product development strategy.
1:02:06
Okay. We'll come to it. Market.
1:02:09
That's okay. We'll come. If you sell to is is Europe is that a
1:02:14
different segment. Yeah. It's a geographic market
1:02:17
development. We'll come to it. We'll come to it now.
1:02:22
Yeah. for the corporate gifting company that
1:02:32
was selling. I didn't come up with a market
1:02:36
penetration. That's okay. Market penetration. I need
1:02:38
not be market penetration. You can say that like corporate gifting for earlier
1:02:42
you were saying that you were gifting for your employees for their birthdays
1:02:46
but you are now going to for their anniversaries. Okay. You're making the
1:02:50
corporate gifting more for the same company. Then like that is market
1:02:53
penetration. Got it. So thinking
1:03:12
that's okay. I do. I do.
1:04:03
Do you want to hear my So the idea is
1:04:12
So the app is like for uh students who are having to get into college. So
1:04:18
basically it's like a college counselor but automated cuz if a school has many
1:04:22
students college can't do anything and I'm trying to set up the school.
1:04:25
Okay. So the consumers are students but the
1:04:28
purchase. So the existing market penetration
1:04:32
strategy is something like a premium pricing where it's free you speak to it
1:04:37
but your colleges are ready pay so much to unlock. Uh so existing consumers will
1:04:42
give you more uh what do you say segment based changes maybe from going to like
1:04:50
you can get into any university to getting like top students top
1:04:54
universities then market development would be uh now
1:04:59
that now it's for like helping students get into a good university now it could
1:05:02
be like helping the same students now they got into university now to give
1:05:06
them a job okay
1:05:08
okay and market uh diversity Diversification
1:05:11
could be like uh maybe assignment helping the students out for like job.
1:05:17
Okay, we'll see. We'll see. It's sort of okay.
1:05:33
Have have. It's really good.
1:05:38
So you are from which country? Kerala.
1:05:41
Huh? Kerala.
1:05:42
Oh, you're from Kerala. Oh, okay. That's okay.
1:05:51
You you ask him also which country he's from but he looks
1:05:54
that bugger. He told he's from India. I did not know that you are from Kerala.
1:05:57
Which part of Kerala? Which country are you?
1:06:02
See if I say India will [ __ ] India. So directly go here. But I've stayed in
1:06:06
Bangalore. I've stayed in Bangalore.
1:06:09
So where did you study? Pune.
1:06:11
Okay. I have a question. So there four Ps and
1:06:20
three Ps. Is it like a formula for you like this is the basic formula to the
1:06:26
product strategy? That is also one thing. Okay. But like
1:06:30
the thing is that the seven Ps of marketing is there for everything,
1:06:32
right? Okay. So I think you did not come for yesterday's session. Okay, go watch
1:06:36
the session, you'll know. Okay, see for example for this phone not like let's
1:06:40
take this one. This is a product but you got it from a shop
1:06:46
that's a place you paid a price for it. You got to know about a promotion.
1:06:50
Promotion is advertisement but you also Yeah. And you also got it
1:06:54
from a person that's the people and you had to stand in a line to get
1:06:58
it. That's a process. Ah,
1:07:00
and there is a brand name here. That's a physical evidence. So for everything,
1:07:04
all the seven PS are there. Oh, okay.
1:07:06
That is the marketing mix. Tet you tell me
1:07:13
for tetra as well. All the seven keys are there.
1:07:17
Okay, set it down. All of you. Oh, this stupid thing is not working.
1:07:25
Boss, is this mic even working? working.
1:07:36
Okay. Okay, let's
1:08:15
Okay, great. I'll just let me rub this part.
1:08:24
You all taken a picture, right? If you want it's okay let me rewrite listen
1:08:30
suppose you are going to launch a new product what is an easy strategy for you
1:08:36
okay listen you're launching a new product there is a new product
1:08:44
you're launching to this existing consumer what do we call this as
1:08:50
h a new product to an existing consumer
1:08:54
this is product development strategy. This is
1:08:57
what is product development strategy. Okay. Suppose you're launching a new
1:09:03
product okay to a very new consumer. What is that called as h?
1:09:09
That is diversification. Now, now if you are like launching a new product, okay,
1:09:16
to a new consumer, that is diversification. If you are launching
1:09:22
existing product an existing product to a new consumer
1:09:25
what is that called as market development
1:09:27
that is market development right now listen
1:09:32
so you're launching a new product to a new consumer this is what is called as
1:09:36
market development sorry new product to a new consumer this
1:09:41
is what is called as diversification Now is a diversification easy or boss I
1:09:52
will do a new product to an existing consumer and then I will take this new
1:09:57
product to a new consumer which is easy. This is market development right? Okay,
1:10:08
a new product, okay, coming to a an existing consumer first and then like
1:10:13
you're taking it to the new consumer. That is market development. So here
1:10:16
there is a product development coupled with the market development. Here it is
1:10:20
diversification. Now which is easy? Which is easy for me?
1:10:26
Are you able to get my question? Okay. Is launching a new product to a new
1:10:29
consumer easy or like a first I will launch the new product to my existing
1:10:34
consumer. Okay. and then I will take it to a new consumer which is easier
1:10:38
market again depends depends on the situation
1:10:42
okay depends on the situation in many cases what do we do is like we do first
1:10:48
uh listen in many cases what do we do is we first try to do a product development
1:10:54
strategy and then like we will go to a market development strategy why because
1:10:58
when you're doing a product development strategy for example he's my existing
1:11:01
consumer is using an Apple laptop now I am going to launch launch an Apple
1:11:06
iPhone to him. Okay, I'm going to launch an Apple iPhone to him. Okay, what is
1:11:10
that strategy called as that is a product development strategy? Okay,
1:11:17
now when he's going to use this iPhone, a lot of you are going to watch him
1:11:21
using the iPhone. So, will it be easy for me to take a tackle a lot of you?
1:11:26
Yes. Or try to target a lot of you? Yes. So a
1:11:30
it's a product development followed by a market development and might be slightly
1:11:34
easy in this case but when I'm launching a health drink okay there
1:11:43
why am I going for a new product to a new consumer
1:11:47
why should I like not huh people
1:11:51
not about that if I'm when I'm launching a vitamin water why should I go for an
1:11:56
okay new consumer with the new products cuz you don't want these consumers to
1:12:01
stop drinking. Exactly. Okay. You do not want like your
1:12:04
existing consumer to be cannibalized by your new products. That is what you
1:12:09
wanted to say as well. Okay. That is exactly why okay the
1:12:13
strategies are very very very different existing customers to be cannibalized.
1:12:18
Okay. By the new products. You do not want your flagship product is what?
1:12:22
Coca-Cola. Okay. You do not want the existing Coca-Cola customers to stop
1:12:26
Coca-Cola and move to water. then that is a very bad strategy. Okay. And this
1:12:31
is the reason why okay a diversification is very different from a market
1:12:36
development strategy. Are you able to get it? So how do you do this drama?
1:12:39
Okay. So that is on like what is the strategy that like you are going to
1:12:43
prepare. Are you able to get it? So do you have to remember all of these words?
1:12:48
Okay. This is what is spoken at the CEO level. Okay. When you're going to an
1:12:52
investor pitch and stuff they will say what is your product development
1:12:55
strategy? what is your market development or where are you planning to
1:12:58
diversify? Okay, this is something pitch decks when you're preparing a pitch deck
1:13:02
and when you're planning to like talk to any your investors, they will ask. But
1:13:06
when you're talking to your salespeople, when you're talking to your salespeople,
1:13:11
they will use a different lingo. Okay, your the inside the organization people
1:13:16
use a different lingo. What is that? Okay, that you have to understand. what
1:13:21
is a variance and what is a line extension
1:13:30
and what is a brand extension. These are three words that you have to definitely
1:13:36
know. What is a variant? What is a line extension and what is a brand extension?
1:13:42
Are you able to get it? Okay. What is a variant? What is a line extension? And
1:13:46
what is a brand extension? Okay. What is this particular variant? If there is
1:13:53
some small change in the product form, okay, then that is what is called as a
1:13:58
variant. This variant is also called as a form extension. Okay, this variant is
1:14:03
also called as a form extension. Now what is the meaning of it? Suppose
1:14:12
DA is selling a soap. Okay, DA is selling a soap which is a milk cream
1:14:18
based soap. Okay. A milk cream based soap. Now D is going to come and launch.
1:14:26
A lemon flavored soap. A soap. But it is lemon flavored or
1:14:32
tangerine flavored soap. Then what is this? This is what is called as a
1:14:36
variant or a form extension. This is what is called as a variant or a form
1:14:41
extension. Are you able to get it now? But what is a line extension?
1:14:46
What is a line extension? If DAV is going to launch, okay, if DA is going to
1:14:52
launch a body wash
1:15:02
now is going to launch a body wash. Then what is this? This is what is called as
1:15:06
the line extension. Why? Because I am extending the product line. So this is a
1:15:13
personal hygiene line. Okay? I am extending the product line. Okay. Then
1:15:19
this is what is called as a line extension. Okay. This is what is called
1:15:22
as a line extension. Now what is a brand extension? A brand extension is an
1:15:27
extension where you're using the brand name to launch completely new product.
1:15:32
Okay. So what is that? If Dav is going to launch let us say pillow covers.
1:15:40
Why? Dove is all about soft white. Okay. pure.
1:15:46
So if Dav is going to launch same silky white okay pure uh pillow covers then
1:15:52
that is what is called as a brand extension. That is what is called as a
1:15:56
brand brand extension. Are you able to get it?
1:15:59
Yes. Are you able to get it? Now for example
1:16:02
let us say a brand called as Durex. What is Durexel?
1:16:06
Condoms. What can be a variant for durex?
1:16:13
H is lube a variant?
1:16:18
Is it a line extension or is it a brand extension?
1:16:21
Huh? So what is there to laugh? I'm asking
1:16:27
what is a variant? Okay, possibly a ribbed
1:16:31
ribbed condoms or like a dotted condoms or like whatever it is. Okay, then that
1:16:36
is what is called as a variant. What is a line extension here?
1:16:40
Merge, huh?
1:16:41
Merchandise. merchandise. Okay, that's a line extension or that is like a brand
1:16:45
extension. Okay, sexual products.
1:16:47
Sexual products. Okay, if you are looking at the sexual wellness line,
1:16:51
okay, then like possibly a lube or like whatever like you said. Okay, that is
1:16:56
what is the line extension. Now, what about the brand extension there?
1:17:01
Yeah, like you said, merch then.
1:17:07
Okay, is the merch. So, for example, I am wearing a direct shirt. I'm not
1:17:10
planning to but like suppose somebody is saying a direction okay is that going to
1:17:14
be a brand extension or a line extension it can be anything
1:17:20
it can be anything that is what it depends from company to company if they
1:17:24
are if they are defining the line as listen this is very very important if
1:17:28
they are defining the line as sexual wellness line
1:17:36
then the condom the tube and the or perfume
1:17:44
or what do you said shirt everything can be a part of the sexual wellness line
1:17:50
all this will be line extension hey this is but how the company defines from see
1:17:56
in lever okay they might have defined it in specific way in like a PNG they might
1:18:01
define it in a different way for example but I'm not defining this line as a
1:18:05
sexual wellness line but I am going to define this line as okay let us a condom
1:18:10
line, apparel line and a deodorant line
1:18:22
then this one will be a brand extension. Are you able
1:18:27
to get it? And this varies from company to company. This varies from company to
1:18:32
company. Are you able to get it? For example, in PNG, okay? or in liver DA
1:18:37
soap to DAO body wash okay to DAO shampoo DAO hair conditioner everything
1:18:44
might be the personal hygiene line but in
1:18:48
uh in lever this might be the line might be defined like this but when you're
1:18:52
going to PNG okay they might define this as a okay boss this is the body body
1:18:57
wash line this is the soap line this might be the air condition line sorry
1:19:02
not air condition this can be the ch the uh the conditioner or the shampoo line.
1:19:06
Okay. Then that will be a brand extension. So this varies from company
1:19:10
to company. Okay. This varies from company to company. You have to
1:19:13
understand how the company defines it. Yes.
1:19:16
If you want to do a brand extension, you so you don't necessar necessarily have
1:19:21
to change the name of what you're creating.
1:19:23
Okay. So do you have to that's a wonderful question our boy is asking. Do
1:19:27
you have to change the name of the brand or you can launch it in the same brand
1:19:31
name? Tell me. Same brand say same brand name okay again depends okay it is not
1:19:39
for example listen tomorrow
1:19:43
say let's take durex itself durex is coming up with the durex sandwiches
1:19:48
durex pizza dur then like will you even buy it why are you laughing when I said
1:19:53
durex lube or durex perfume or dur none of you laughed okay everything depends
1:19:58
on what is that central core value of your brand Okay. Everything depends on
1:20:03
central core value of your brand. If your central core value is violated then
1:20:07
you cannot launch it in the same brand name. You have to launch it in different
1:20:10
brand names. If you if it is not violated you can launch it in the same
1:20:14
brand names. Are you able to get this logic? Are you able to get this logic?
1:20:18
So far what we have covered we covered like boss how do you like create more
1:20:24
revenue for your organization and by launching new products. Okay. The next
1:20:29
class we will see how do you optimize this? How do you prioritize? Which is
1:20:34
the brand that I which is the product that I have to prioritize? Which is the
1:20:37
brand that I need not prioritize. Okay, that we will see in the next class and
1:20:41
then we will start with distribution in the next class. Any questions folks?
