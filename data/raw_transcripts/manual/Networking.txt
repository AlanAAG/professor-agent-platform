Mr. Phil Bedford
8:00
Has it been cheeky? How'd they do it?
8:16
Word of mouth which was passed by by people. Right. Right. Okay. By
8:22
people. So the point was what happened was is Paul Rivere got on his horse.
8:27
This is what's called um the ride the midnight ride of Paul River. Okay. He
8:30
got on his horse and he he rode to one village, to another hamlet, to another
8:35
house, and he was basically shouting, "Uh, to arms, the British are coming.
8:40
The red coats are coming. Get your gun. We need to go." And he got these people
8:44
by going village to village to village. Anyway, Paul Rivere managed to get
8:49
enough of these people to come up that when they met the red coats at con
8:58
makes me really sad. Now look at America. Oh, look at Hello.
9:07
That's a bit too much. Hello. Hello. Hello. Okay. So, look at
9:12
America today. United States. arguably the most powerful country in the world.
9:16
Right? In those days, it was a subservient state of England.
9:22
That fight, that shot changed the world. Changed the world. And it was all
9:31
because of PE him. Okay? So, he rode doing that. Now,
9:36
what's interesting was there was another guy. He went in one direction and it was
9:42
too loud. And there was a guy went in the other direction called William
9:44
Doors. Paul Rivere went that way. William Doors
9:49
went this way. And William did the same thing. The red coats are coming into
9:52
arms. Now the interesting thing is there is no recorded
9:56
people turning up to fight from what William Doors said. They all came from
10:01
Paul Rivere. Let's look at the two people, both
10:05
business owners, both riding with a powerful message. He activates the
10:10
country and changes the world. This guy does nothing.
10:15
Why? Same message.
10:34
Okay. Could be that. I saw that hand first.
10:42
Okay. I like it. Gentleman with a hat. The second guy wasn't I like it. Okay.
10:49
Do me a favor as well. Actually, if you can give me a name when you speak, I'd
10:52
love to know who that You know, one of the things I like to do is keep my eyes
10:55
open for the people who are really switched on and coming out with smart
10:57
stuff. Okay. So that's a really nice way of me getting to know you as well. Okay.
11:01
Sorry. Gentleman with a hat. Ahmed from Saudi.
11:06
Oh, cool. So it was the communication. Yeah, it
11:10
was the um who he was. Yeah. His connections. Tell me more about that
11:13
quickly. Okay. Would anyone want to add any? I'll
11:28
come to you then. You Beautiful.
11:45
Nice. And your name? Sorry. George.
11:51
The young lady behind you. Yeah.
12:03
Okay. I got it. I like it. Uh that gentleman
12:07
in the pink. I met the wrong people. Met the wrong people.
12:13
Can I get your names as well? You okay?
12:24
The same message. Ah, you thought maybe he was he didn't
12:39
have the credibility. He was going to cheat them.
12:47
Ah, okay. Interesting. Okay. Um, go on. We're
12:52
going to stop after this one. Yeah. Okay.
13:04
Okay. Well, the same, just so you know, the message was the same to both of
13:07
them. They all met together and then they did that. So, you're all right.
13:10
Anyway, great. All of you. Great. So, the the young lady from Venezuela come
13:13
with And there. Okay. Here we go. So,
13:20
um you're all kind of right to be fair. The big difference was, right, it was
13:25
who their social circle was and who they were as individuals. So Paul Rivere is
13:30
described, he's a businessman, but he's described as extremely social. He had
13:35
lots of friends. He he was on the committee of, it's really crazy, but the
13:41
Gaslight Association. Okay, it shows you how old it is, right?
13:45
Okay. The Gaslight Association, he played poker. He was social. He was
13:49
described as gregarious and friendly. William Doors was just a business owner
13:54
who was passionate about getting rid of the Brits.
13:58
So the difference was the person, his personality, his social circle, his
14:02
ability to influence. So my question is to you,
14:08
who do you want to be, Paul Rivere or William Doors? Which
14:12
one's going to serve your life journey and your business? To be this or to be
14:16
this? It's up to you. It's your choice. Okay.
14:20
So, so here's the thing, right? In business, you can get stuff done through
14:24
people, which is ultimately free and fast, but if you don't want to go down
14:29
that route, you have to go down this route. And how do you get things done
14:32
down that route? Money.
14:36
And one of the biggest challenges for a small business owner is I've got loads
14:40
of time, but not a lot of money. So, what we do is we leverage this. Sweet.
14:45
These days there's a different dynamic. Maybe we look another way. So just
14:49
imagine for one minute who's the richest person, the best entrepreneur you know
14:55
Musk. Someone says Musk. Okay. Imagine someone that you really
15:00
respect. So it could be Branson. It could be Musk. He lost it yesterday by
15:04
the way. Did you hear? Richest person in the world.
15:07
Warren Buffett. Okay. So think of that person right now. You got a choice.
15:12
Imagine that you had half an hour with that person like like Shark Tank or
15:18
something and you pitched you you just explained to this person. They go, "You
15:22
know what? I love what you're trying to do and
15:26
here's a choice. I'm going to give you $100,000 dollars
15:31
to get going or I will open up my little black book
15:35
and I'll start to connect you to the people I know."
15:39
Which one are you going to take? The black book.
15:41
The black book, right? Because that one is more valuable. So
15:47
why do people always go for money when they're trying to grow their business?
16:14
100%. Okay. And by the way, just one other thing. Uh I know the mobile phones
16:18
are lovely and they're an addiction, but if I see people on their mobile phones,
16:21
part of your class participation is going to dive.
16:25
Okay. All right. So, just give me that little warning now. Unless you're taking
16:28
photos of me and then go ahead. Okay. All right.
16:48
are better. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Anyway, we're all
16:53
along the same thing. I I acknowledge everything you're saying, but you're abs
16:56
and by the way, you could use both, right? Sometimes you need money, but the
16:59
connections at the end of the day, you know, can you imagine Branson's best
17:03
mate gets a phone call and saying, "Look, don't mess around. You need to
17:08
speak to this guy and take him seriously." And he'll go, "Okay,
17:12
that's invaluable." And by the way, you might want to invest a bit in this place
17:15
as well because you know I don't mess around.
17:18
So we need both. But I think the thing is is people don't understand the value
17:22
of relationships. And most entrepreneurs when they start their business, they
17:25
find great creative ways to spend money and don't think of this. So this is why
17:32
we're here today. Make sense? Um I'll give you a little bit of my history as
17:36
well because what I've done so you know who I am and how I got here. Um but
17:40
yeah, well done. Great start. Awesome stuff. Okay, so a little bit about my my
17:44
history. Uh when I left school, I messed up.
17:49
I honestly thought when I did my exams that I was supposed to just know
17:55
everything and so I turned up and failed everything. I didn't revise. I didn't do
17:59
anything. I was terrible. I I got a a history really low grade or something.
18:04
And then I spent the next five or six years putting myself back through
18:09
college. Um, I used to wash dishes in a restaurant six days a week and my one
18:13
day off I went to college. Okay, I messed up. So, I went back
18:17
through I ended up with a master's degree in civil engineering and
18:21
underwater technology. I used to specialize in, you know, the big
18:24
helmets, the diving films. I used I'm qualified to do that. So, I used to dive
18:29
and I remember going down and diving on bombs and all that sort of stuff. So,
18:33
um, that was part of my my qualification.
18:36
But unfortunately, I'm not an engineer. the idea of crossing a bridge that I
18:41
designed would be really scary. So, I decided to leave that. It wasn't my
18:45
personality, but I did it. Um, I spent a number of years after that. My
18:52
first business, oddly enough, I was I was 12 years old
18:58
and I didn't realize it was a business. I used my mom used to give me a pack
19:02
lunch um but everyone else used to go to the school canteen. But she gave me a
19:07
packed lunch and part of my packed lunch was orange juice in a in quite a big
19:11
flask. And then when we'd be sat in class, I was the only one that had
19:16
orange juice in a flask. Supply and demand.
19:22
So my mates are all, "Can I get a drink?" I'm like, "Yeah, sure. 10 p, 5
19:25
p, 3 p." I was selling my lunch and I didn't know I was in business until you
19:30
go back and look at it. So I was 12 years old, my first business. I know
19:34
it's not going to excite you guys because you're thinking millions, but I
19:36
thought it was pretty cool. Um, a number of years later, I moved to Dubai. I
19:41
worked in recruitment in the UK. I worked in exhibition stand sales. So, I
19:46
thought when I moved to Dubai, I had a job. And my honest mindset was um if I
19:53
don't if I'm not a manager within the first five years, I'm going home.
19:59
Within the first two weeks, I started my business, which
20:04
was salsa. So, those of you who know salsa dance, I've taught salsa for 30
20:09
years. I know I don't look like it.
20:13
And any Latin Americans in the room are going, "Yeah, right, buddy.
20:18
I promise you the boy can dance." Okay. So, I taught salsa for 30 years. I've
20:23
danced in Kuba, Latin America, Peru was. Um, I've danced in a UK, Australia. So,
20:30
if you look like me and you want to dance, I've given you some hope. All
20:34
right. Okay. So, that was my first business. Then I started off doing um
20:38
kite surfing. I had a kite surfing business, teaching it and selling the
20:41
equipment. Okay. Um, and then what I did is I moved into consulting. So, I opened
20:46
my new business. So, I own a business called Incentive, which is an
20:50
international franchise. I've run that for 19 years. Now, take a pause there.
20:55
How many businesses fail in the first two years?
21:00
Do you know what the exact% your name?
21:04
Nicholas from Columbia.
21:07
Cool. Okay. All right. So 95% failed in the first two years.
21:14
How many fell in the second in up to five years?
21:20
Huh? Yeah. There's even more. Yeah. There's
21:24
only like 5% of those remaining finished at five years. So if you get to five
21:29
years, start celebrating. Okay? Now, some of these dynamics, by
21:33
the way, tend to be across the board. First two years, don't expect to turn a
21:37
profit. I know I'm getting off my thing a little bit, but they say don't expect
21:40
to turn a profit, and you got to have the money to keep going. By five years,
21:44
you'll probably be earning what you'd have been earning if you never left your
21:48
job in the first place in terms of what you spent. And then when you get to
21:53
seven years, things should start to motor. It's not always that, but it's
21:56
257. It's called the 257 journey. Okay? And I know loads of people that have
22:00
been through that. Okay? So 19 years in business.
22:06
I've run business. I had I've owned businesses in India uh and uh Australia
22:11
and now England and here. So four continents.
22:14
Okay. And all around teaching people how to network and building networks. Okay.
22:20
My last business is called Strategic Business Connect. I started two and a
22:23
half years ago with my wife and that's been that's a whole new ecosystem. Okay.
22:27
So, I've launched it. I've done it basically. That's what I'm saying. You
22:30
know, I'm not someone standing up here teaching entrepreneurism and I haven't
22:33
done it myself. I'm there. Okay. And I know in this room
22:39
many of you are way ahead of me in terms of your knowledge and your business in
22:44
what you do. So, I acknowledge you for that.
22:48
But I know my stuff and that's what I'm here to share with you. Cool.
22:52
All right. I have written these books, by the way, if anyone wants to read a
22:55
book. Uh, two of them were international bestsellers on Amazon. Uh, the one on
22:59
the right was a New York Times bestseller which I co-authored. Um, and
23:02
I've been featured in some of these publications. So, why or for what reason
23:07
do you think it would be important for you possibly in your journey to be
23:10
featured in these publications? Yes, sir.
23:24
reliability and credibility. Yeah. Okay. Spot on. Okay. Yep.
23:30
Publicity. Okay. For what reason? Brand awareness. Yep. So, here's the
23:41
thing. This is where I'm going to challenge you a little bit because
23:43
visibility, publicity, brand awareness. For what purpose?
23:49
Excuse me. For what purpose?
23:53
He had it. Okay, these are features. The benefit is credibility. What does
23:59
credibility do for you? But what does that do?
24:06
Sorry again. Okay. Okay. Sorry, your name again,
24:11
mate. Isaac.
24:11
Isaac. Sorry, I'm By the way, for someone who teaches networking, I'm
24:15
terrible at names. So, I I know it's weird, eh? So, I will keep going, but I
24:18
remember faces. Okay. That's just my personal challenge. Okay. So, there you
24:22
go. I mess up, you mess up. We all mess up together, but we all learn, right?
24:26
Okay. All right. Okay. So, credibility ultimately
24:33
makes things happen quicker as opposed to time. There's a great
24:40
book, by the way, called The Speed of Trust by Steven Cubby Jr. And you think
24:44
about how quickly things happen when someone trusts you. If if uh Richard
24:48
Branson says you have to work with this guy, people go, "Okay,
24:53
okay." Now, in your life, your business going forward,
24:57
are things going to happen for you quicker and easier if the people around
25:00
you are of that caliber who when they say, "Trust this guy, do this, everyone
25:05
goes, "Yeah, sure. No problem." or are they going to be about the people like
25:10
sorry who are you again with no credibility okay so the reason I
25:15
did this was credibility do you know what this is called as a strategy in
25:19
business getting into articles on TV what's it called
25:24
PR who said that fantastic well done your name
25:30
okay PR okay can you imagine how much you have to pay for PR
25:35
a How much is a lot, please?
25:56
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well done. Yeah.
26:04
And just to be in like on Forbes, do you know how much that costs?
26:09
You can't be in Forbes unless you pay. Do you know that?
26:11
Yes. Right. Yeah. Tens 20 thousands of
26:15
dollars. Uh Entrepreneur magazine. This is the radio. I've been on the radio a
26:18
couple of times in Dubai, BBC. These are all places I've been featured. Can you
26:22
imagine how much I spent and invested in my brand over the last 12?
26:26
You believe? Can anyone tell me how much I spent?
26:34
I'll warn you. Trick question. Zero.
26:39
I spent zero. I saved all that money because when you go to a PR company, do
26:45
you know what they're paying them for? What are you paying them to do?
26:51
You're paying them to contact the reporters who they have a
26:57
relationship with and say, "You need to see this guy or girl."
27:03
Yes. Public relations. There's different
27:06
kinds of public relations. Some of them is getting you into a magazine. Um, and
27:11
thanks for asking. Hey, first come. So when is getting you in a magazine to
27:16
build your credibility as a source of expertise. The other sort of PR is what
27:21
you see if let's say there's an international airplane disaster and the
27:25
company needs to rebuild their credibility with their user base. Two
27:29
different kinds of people, right? Okay. So yeah, I spent zero. The reason is I
27:35
didn't need to pay the PR agent for their relationships
27:39
because I built my own. And this is your choice. So, when's the
27:44
best time to build a roof? Who said that? Before it rains.
27:53
Build the roof before it rains, not after. All right. When's the best time
27:58
to start building this elite network of yours?
28:00
Now. Okay. And by the way, you are going to be part of each other's network.
28:06
Would that be fair to say? You know, you're going through this
28:09
journey together. You've all got different skill sets from different
28:12
places. Some people will become friends and you'll become tight. Others will
28:15
just be connections, but this is part of your network going forward. Imagine
28:19
what's possible with this amazing group of people together going forward. How
28:24
you can help each other, look out for each other. So a big part of a scorec
28:27
card that we're going to be doing going forward is also how you can look out for
28:31
each other from now. How you can help each other from now. But not just you.
28:36
Now imagine how many people do you know my friend
28:43
thousand people. How many do people do you know their name where they're from
28:47
and if they have a business? Do you actually know them?
28:51
Okay. They actually say it's not possible to know more than 150 people as
28:56
in a relationship. It's called the Dumbar number.
29:00
150 to actually have a relationship. All right. After that, they're just names
29:06
and numbers and you can't they're How many of you on Facebook? I'm feeling
29:10
really old now. How many of you are on Facebook? It's like no one. About 10
29:13
years ago, it was like everybody. Okay. Insta your followers, right? Or
29:18
whatever. These people are not your friends.
29:22
If you want to know if they're your friends, ask them for a lift to the
29:25
airport, right? So your tight friends is going to
29:29
be small. So but even if you said 150 people now times everyone in this room
29:34
by 150 people. So not just the people in the room, you
29:39
could have access to each other's network if you know, like and trust each
29:41
other. Now what's possible just from this room? This is you networking
29:46
between each other but now leveraging each other's networks.
29:50
Now, do you see the possibility? But the problem is with networking, everybody's
29:54
thinking this. Hi, here's my business card.
29:58
Buy from me. No. Okay. Waste of time. That's how people's thinking about
30:04
networking. Am I right? Are any of you there thinking that here's my business
30:08
card? No. Do you see the potential? Now, this
30:12
is networking. This is networking. Leveraging each other's thing is
30:16
networking. That's what we're going to be talking about.
30:20
Nice. All right. Okay. What's next? I can't remember what the next slide is
30:24
now. Here we go. Oh, hello. Just a little bit more about me. Just
30:28
thought just just to give you a bit of context. Um, anyone know what an Iron
30:31
Man is? Did I say I did it?
30:45
Okay. So, yeah, I did an IMAN South Africa three years ago. Full iron man.
30:49
Full iron man. Yeah. So um just to let you know that's one of my sports. Um
30:56
um that's one. Uh Oops, Daisy. Where's my other slide? Let me go back. Uh this
31:00
is my other stuff. Just to give you some history. I told you I taught salsa.
31:04
That's me dancing behind Sarah. That's one of my networks. Uh I play underwater
31:09
hockey. In Colombia it's massive. The Colombian
31:13
people in the room. It's massive in Colombia.
31:16
Yeah. One of the what? One of the best teams in the world, mate.
31:19
Yeah, one of the best teams in the world.
31:23
Okay. The last group actually came to my club and we played together. There was
31:27
like 20 students came and we all did underwater hockey together. It was dead
31:30
cool. I'm just warning you, me and a swimsuit
31:33
is not good. Okay. And um and this was speaking. Okay. So, this is speaking.
31:39
Okay. So, this is a little bit about what I do. Question. By the way, what
31:43
you'll notice is I'm not getting you to write loads of stuff down. I'm trying to
31:46
change your mindsets. Are you with me? All right. So,
31:53
what's the best car in the world? What's the best model?
32:03
BMW X5. Gentleman at the back in the black.
32:09
Rolls-Royce. You better start earning money quick, buddy. Okay. Lad with a
32:12
hat. Bug. Bugatti.
32:17
I like the way you think. The one that makes you happy.
32:21
The one that makes you happy. We got a nice guy at the front.
32:26
Excuse me. A what?
32:30
Oh, what's one of them? Oh, is it?
32:35
Now you're making me feel even more old, guys. What's going on? Okay. Okay, you
32:39
got my point. Okay, so here's the thing. What I didn't tell you is I want to go
32:43
desert driving. Now, what's the best car in the world?
32:51
Oh, yeah. You got me right. You got me right. Okay. So, here's the
32:55
thing. By the way, any of you ever done sales training?
33:00
Sales training. Cold calling. Okay, that leads If you
33:05
just done sales training, you might have asked me, "What do you want the car to
33:08
do?" Okay, so just just a little question.
33:12
Okay. Anyway, so my question to you is um
33:17
another part of building your brand, building your connections is to go
33:22
networking. Okay? And networking is normally where you go to a group of
33:26
people and you you crush the here's my business card and you make connections.
33:30
That's networking. Okay? One of the things we're going to be getting you to
33:34
do is go out and do networking. Okay? But this is why I'm going to go here.
33:41
These are all networks. Okay, I've been in a load of different
33:46
networks. Okay, so number one, I was in an entrepreneurial network called BNI.
33:51
There's over 2,000 business owners in this region. Okay, I'm in another one
33:56
which is CEOs that have been in Dubai for 30 years. Some of the biggest
34:00
companies in this WhatsApp group called the Excelsia group. Just bear this in
34:06
mind. BNI, Excelsia. I've been in a speaker group. I've been in underwater
34:11
hockey because it's a network. I've been in Salsa because it's a network. And
34:16
I've got my friends and family. Which of those
34:21
has been most impactful in terms of me getting my first clients, my first
34:26
franchises, and the connections to get most of these?
34:33
Okay, let me go again. You said salsa. So there was salsa, underwater hockey,
34:37
the CEO group, the BNI group, friends and family. So we
34:42
got one one vote for salsa. Friends and family.
34:47
CEO. CEO. Yeah, you think right. Okay.
34:50
All of the above. Uh, smart. Go for one. Hockey.
34:59
An order hockey. I got some people want to try it.
35:02
Gentleman in the corner. Friends and family.
35:04
Friends and family. Okay. Salsa. But what do people do? You've been
35:14
looking at my notes. Okay. Yes. Okay. So, here's the thing. Most people when
35:19
they're choosing these networks, they choose based on how many people are in
35:22
there or what they think it can do. So, first of all is to be able to look at a
35:27
networking group and say, "Right, that's where I need to be investing my time."
35:31
Not there. But we need to look at it strategically.
35:34
Okay. So we will be looking at that. Okay. But what I'm trying to encourage
35:38
you to think is the stuff you could be doing for fun can be just as powerful.
35:45
Okay. business cont.
36:10
Yeah. Yeah. 100%.
36:16
Yeah. So, what you're talking and this is this is really cool. So, what you're
36:19
doing is you're connecting over the common values. when you connect over
36:22
common values. What? Okay, so making me digress a little bit. A little bit. Um,
36:27
and I love these questions. So, thank you because it allows me to make it a
36:30
little bit more interesting. Um, we're only motivated by two things. Do
36:36
you know what they are? Interesting. Okay. People are only
36:44
motivated by two things. Everybody. Go on. Sorry.
36:52
Okay. Okay. Let me simplify it for the comedians over here. Okay. Let me
36:58
simplify it for you. Moving towards pleasure
37:02
and away from pain. That's it.
37:07
That's what motiv Oh, I want to hear what that was afterwards. Okay. So,
37:10
moving towards pleasure and away from pain. Okay. So when we when we were um
37:15
prehistoric, all right, when we, you know, go back to all the mammoths and
37:19
the saber-tooth tigers and we were running around in fursuits,
37:24
if everything either wanted to eat us or it was our food,
37:29
right? Which meant that as human beings, we're hardwired
37:34
to watch out for threats. If something's threatening us, what do we do?
37:40
There's only three choices. fight, flight,
37:47
paralysis. Do nothing. Fight, flight, freeze. Right? So, what happens when
37:53
things are too different from us? We see it as a threat.
37:58
Which means we fight, flight, freeze. When things are similar to us, what
38:02
happens is they're like me, I feel safe. Okay? That's why when we're asking
38:10
questions to people and we find out we're from the same country. Anyone here
38:14
is from the same country. You'd have felt a bond the minute you spoke because
38:17
you're surrounded with people that aren't from your country. Okay. So,
38:21
that's what happens. Um where were we with with your sport? You start to bond.
38:27
You feel safe because you're around cycling and they're much more willing to
38:31
not only open up but also because you have a bond, they want to help you. So,
38:35
that's why your social group is powerful. But you need to be
38:38
appropriate. You can't go up and say, "Hey, let's go soaking. What do you
38:41
Let's go cycling. What do you do in business? I want to sell you a house."
38:44
Okay? So, you have to be appropriate. Sorry.
39:00
You ask. You ask. We'll do some work on that.
39:05
Okay. I'll give you some tips on that. Yes. That's part that's part of
39:13
networking. The biggest mistake people make is they only talk about business,
39:18
right? And then if there's no immediate connection, they move on.
39:23
All right. Connection. Imagine if you connect over cycling and then you spend
39:27
time with each other. Suddenly you realize, oh my gosh, his best mate's the
39:31
GM of Microsoft, but you never go there because you were only thinking about
39:34
business, right? This part of the world, where's my friend from Saudi? Okay, in
39:39
this part of the world, what's the greeting? It's not business.
39:44
It's how are you? How are your family? It's
39:48
social. And if you go straight for business,
39:52
they won't work with you. All right? So this part of the world
39:56
teaches relationship first. Know something about people, then you'll do
40:00
business with them. And that's a beautiful that actually goes around the
40:02
whole world. We just don't know it. Okay.
40:10
Yes. Yeah. You can kind of build it in some
40:13
We'll do some work on behavioral styles later on. So, some people if you ask
40:17
about their social straight up front, they'll be really uncomfortable and it
40:21
will actually be seen as a threat. Other people, they only want to talk about
40:25
that. Okay. Right. What I'm going to do very quickly, um, I'm going to give you
40:29
guys a bit of a stand because it is warm. Okay. Um, I think I'm interesting,
40:33
but still it's uh it's still tough to sat here and listen. So, I acknowledge
40:37
that. Can I give you five minutes just to get up and have a bit of a refresh?
40:41
Go to the bathroom. Is that okay? Yeah. Now, agreement. I'm literally I'm
40:46
on my watch. Um, so that's going to be 10 minutes past exactly. Okay. So, on
40:51
your honor, please come back exactly on time so we can get going. Yeah. All
40:54
right. Do
40:59
you still use business cards? Good question.
41:01
I'm the only people I think in this room has business cards.
41:05
Ah, so I I do I like to take them. Thank you. Yeah, I like to take them.
41:10
Yeah, I like to take them. I prefer giving
41:12
And he should tell you what he said. We'll do it at the end.
41:16
Okay. Tell me at the end. It's going to be trouble. You lot. I can tell. Great
41:19
stuff. Well done. Oh god. Oh my gosh. You don't want a
41:22
bathroom. Okay. How you doing? Yeah. My name is Louis.
41:25
Hey Mo. So I wanted some advice.
41:27
Sure. So um so um I should start by saying the
41:33
business I do. Basically I want to get advice on how to reactate.
41:38
How to reactate contact. to in the past. I've met a lot
41:43
of people. Ah, I love it. Can you ask me that in
41:45
the thing at the end because that'll be good for everybody.
41:48
Okay. Because we're going to do that in the scorecard.
41:51
Good question, man. Really great question.
41:53
Yes, sir. Uh, so basically,
41:56
how you doing? Hi.
41:58
Okay. So, I want to ask like I'm talking to
42:00
you right now. How do I make sure that I'm able to connect with you properly on
42:04
your social basis? I said, how you connect?
42:06
What? Face to face or on social media? Oh, no. face to face like I'm connecting
42:10
with you right now. So, how do I make sure that I am able to understand
42:13
social? We'll do that in the program.
42:16
Yeah, we'll absolutely do that in the program. Don't worry. Good question.
42:19
Yeah, because sometimes I usually go straight to people and sometimes do
42:24
social a bit. I don't just I sometime I feel like okay, this person is more open
42:29
to talk about. You're absolutely right. Some people
42:31
are, some people aren't. We'll we'll touch on that at a much deeper level.
42:34
Can you hold on to that for a minute? Sure. And then we'll go much deeper on
42:37
that. But good ask. Yeah. Well done.
42:41
I think who was next? I think I think first of lesson
42:46
I actually enjoyed it today. I'm just a bit sleepy. That's why I'm not
42:49
participating a lot. But uh you tell us where you're from.
42:53

be more actually. Okay. How are you? Lovely to meet you. How are
44:24
you? Nice to meet you.
44:28
Yeah, like I really relate to the presentation that you did cuz like what
44:32
I did in my high school like when I was also doing business okay that I go to
44:36
like art communities that that's basically what I like and then through
44:39
that I didn't realize that I was meeting my future partners and also like my
44:43
friends who helped me to go into like some sort of like really interesting
44:46
communities. You know one thing that I saw in some people when they go to like
44:50
networking events is that sometimes they have like badges like they kind of want
44:54
people Oh, what is this community? Or like, oh, is this something I should do?
44:58
Like, is this like do you think like that sort of like small branding
45:02
really sparks like Yeah, we'll touch on that later on. Uh, and you can do some
45:06
people think it's a little bit, but you can do it just helps people that
45:09
forget names like me. True,
45:13
but we'll talk about that later on in more depth. Okay, nice to meet you. And
45:16
where you from? Indonesia.
45:17
Indonesia. Super duper. Fantastic. Hi, buddy. How are you doing?
45:21
I'm Martin from Hey, Martin. ah
45:24
to Columbia. So I don't know if you want to still
45:27
talk because there's a lot of people talk a lot but I wanted to ask you why
45:34
you studied like engineer civil stuff. Ah why if I didn't like it? Yeah, man.
45:42
Because when I messed up at school, I got a job on a building site holding
45:47
this the I started off carrying bricks, right? And then I got a job holding the
45:51
stick that the surveyors use and then I and then there was one of the
45:55
engineers had lost his driving license because he was drunk driving and they
45:59
needed someone to drive him. So I I got a job driving this guy and I thought
46:03
this is really interesting and I asked the company if they put me through
46:06
college rather than do nothing. So I ended up studying this just because it
46:10
was something to do and that got me into university. So
46:12
you didn't knew your passion about networking.
46:15
No idea, mate. And by the way, I'm an introvert. So uh you discover
46:20
I just love people. You know, I really like I like I like
46:24
know knowing people from all over the world. I get a real buzz from helping
46:28
and connections and I just love that. I didn't realize uh but I do. Yeah.
46:34
Yeah. I haven't introduced myself. Amar Jordan say American history.
46:41
Ah, thank you. Start some American history.
46:44
My question is where'd you get that cool name? Who gave you that cool name? The
46:47
rebel networker. It was one of my clients.
46:49
Client. So he um yeah, we were looking for a
46:53
name that kind of described you. Um and he says, "Phil, you're a bit of a rebel,
46:58
mate." He says, "You're teaching networking, but it's completely against
47:01
what everyone else does. Plus, I taught salsa and I look like this. Plus, I did
47:05
kite surfing. They're like, "You're a bit of a rebel." And I went,
47:07
"That's a good name." There you go. Thank you.
47:10
Of course. Yeah. It kind of sticks, right? All
47:11
right. Is it true that people with less hair
47:15
like people act more appeal? What appeal?
47:20
No, really. Like I have the but I have no idea. It boosts your
47:26
confidence because I think I I think when you when you're
47:30
willing to do this, you got more confidence than someone
47:33
who's trying to hide it. I don't know, mate. I don't know. I'd
47:38
love to have hair, but it's not part of my journey.
47:44
All right. Hey, buddy. Hi.
47:45
How you doing? Sash. Hey, Sash. How are you?
47:47
Good. How are you? All good, man.
47:49
I wanted to ask, did you ever think about joining YPO?
47:52
Uh, no. Why?
47:55
Not my kind of network, but I wouldn't mind speaking there
47:59
maybe. I'll tell you about it on another
48:02
occasion. Done. So I mean like I was just talking
48:05
to my dad yesterday night about this and so there's two organizations that he's
48:09
in. One is EO. You know about EO he just left EO. He's like it's gone to [ __ ] the
48:14
Delhi chapter Y. So I'm part of YG Dubai now.
48:18
Okay. So I just wanted to like talk about that
48:20
like it's like well the YP is in young people's.
48:23
Yes. younger because I'm not young, mate.
48:25
No, no, no. But I'm saying I've got younger chapters, so I wanted to like
48:28
ask if you were part of Y. I'm not. Anyway, we got to get going,
48:31
guys. Yeah. You okay?
48:36
Where you from? Mexico.
48:37
Mexico. Okay. Ah, someone else is from Mexico as well. All right. Patrick.
48:41
Yeah. Good for you. And your name? Desire. Ah, okay. And you? Nice to meet
48:49
you. Okay, everyone. Here we go. Let's go.
48:56
All right. Okay, we got to get moving on.
49:06
Okay, so so just briefly, the people came up to me in the break. Thanks for
49:10
the feedback. That was awesome. Uh really appreciate it. And some great
49:13
conversations to have going on. Those of you who choose just to have a break, I
49:16
get it as well. Uh I always need to fresh my mind. Anyway, so let's kick
49:20
off. All right, here we go. So we mentioned this.
49:26
Okay, we've done that. All right. So now we're going to get to the technical bit.
49:30
Again, please ask questions. So the problem is with,
49:37
let me say this differently. When you get an emergency,
49:41
do you ever get a warning? A warning. Watch out. Emergency in 10
49:49
minutes. Yeah.
49:50
Do you Ah, okay. So that's Yeah. Right. So the
49:58
people that were at the thing didn't get a warning. So when you know when you get
50:02
a problem, you don't get warning. It's like bang. You know, you got trouble
50:05
with the law. Uh you can't get on an airplane. Um you suddenly left without
50:10
money. Your car's broken down. All right. A problem hits you, right? How do
50:15
you solve the problem quickly? connect. Oh, you can ring, spend money,
50:20
or you got connections, right? Okay. So, I remember when I had a when I had a car
50:24
crash in Dubai, um, excuse me.
50:30
Oh, question. Okay. So, when I had a car crash in Dubai, I don't speak Arabic,
50:33
which is going to get me in trouble with my friend there. I know, but I started,
50:38
but I stopped. Um, but I didn't speak Arabic. And the problem was, um, I'd
50:42
heard all these stories about people who could speak Arabic speaking to the
50:45
police and telling them it was my fault. and I wouldn't know what they were
50:49
saying, right? So, I had the compassion. I'm right, who do I know who likes me
50:54
enough to leave his house and come and speak Arabic for me so I don't get in
50:58
trouble? And in two minutes, I I called this guy called Sahel from Lebanon. I
51:03
used I used to desert drive with him. He turned up in in his thing, had a
51:08
conversation with the police, and the other guy got in trouble, not me. And it
51:11
was their fault. Okay. All right. But the point was I had the
51:15
connection, right? And so what I did when I had the problem was go through a
51:19
mental thing in my head. Who do I know can solve this problem? Okay. And the
51:23
thing is if we don't know anyone that's blank,
51:27
correct? So what we're doing again now is we're actually starting to build
51:31
this. So part of starting to build this resource for you is to be able to
51:36
organize it in how it can help you. Is there anyone in the room that likes to
51:40
be organized process? Oh, lots of you.
51:45
Okay. Okay. All right. So, here we go. There's only really
51:51
three kinds of each person you have, each individual will fall into one of
51:56
these areas in your future network. Okay. So, your network has three uses.
52:02
Number one, I is information. So each person in your network some of
52:08
them can give you what kind of information could they give you as an
52:11
entrepreneur in anything right?
52:17
Yeah. So maybe it's legal. You got a legal question. You know I'm setting up
52:21
in Dubai and I don't know is the business different here to somewhere
52:24
else. You know I'm going to Saudi Arabia to open up a business. Is it different
52:27
there to the states? You know so we think oh who do I know who?
52:32
You suddenly become valuable for everyone here who wants to know
52:34
something about Saudi Arabia. Am I right? You become an information source.
52:39
Anyone wants to set up in Mexico, then you got a couple of people here as well.
52:43
You're an information source. Okay. So, every person could be an information.
52:47
How about the best investments? By the way, the best investments by the
52:53
time you hear about it, they've already gone, right? Too late. So, you need the
52:57
people with a finger on the pulse solving problems of information. The
53:01
second part of your network is support. Support.
53:06
Who do you go to if you need a lift to the airport? Who do you go to if um
53:12
you're ill and you can't go to the shops,
53:16
right? Um who do you go to if you're emotionally just you're going to blow up
53:21
emotionally? Who do you go to? Could
53:31
be anybody. Yeah. Could be anybody. Could be your best friends. Could be
53:35
your people in your network. PE. One of the things, one of the biggest um things
53:38
I'd say to you, and this is why I said this network, which is what you are, is
53:42
so important, is you can support each other going forward.
53:47
Your support network is often as entrepreneurs other entrepreneurs
53:51
because somebody who's got a job has never been through what you're going
53:56
to go through. They can't understand it because they get a wage every week.
54:02
Doesn't matter what happens, they're getting paid next week. Whereas you guys
54:05
theoretically, if I don't work, I'm on the street, man.
54:10
They can't understand that. Even our husbands and wives, boyfriends and
54:14
girlfriends don't understand what it's like to be an entrepreneur. So part of
54:17
your support network will be you but other entrepreneurs as well. But it also
54:20
could be your mom, dad, brother, sister, best friend. People help us in different
54:24
ways, right? But particularly these days mental health is huge, right? So the
54:30
support of people that can lift you up and say yes, you can rather than no you
54:33
can't. And I guarantee you one of the biggest problems for an entrepreneur, do
54:38
you know what one of the biggest reasons for failure is for an entrepreneur?
54:43
Oh, nice one. You're not going to believe this. You're going to you're
54:45
going to shoot me down in flames. Our life partner, wife, husband. Biggest
54:53
reason for failure. Okay? Because they either support us or
54:58
they're like, I've had enough of this entrepreneur thing. I want I haven't had
55:01
a handbag. I haven't been on holiday for six months. You need to go and get a
55:04
job, for example. Okay. Support. And the last
55:09
one is B. business. The people in your network can either buy from you or
55:15
recommend you to people that can buy from you.
55:19
Every person could fall into one of those, right? So, there'll be people in
55:24
here. My guess is most of the people in here would would fall into which
55:28
category if you're looking to structure this?
55:32
Sorry. Support.
55:36
And so, you're there. Is that more valuable than someone who's just your
55:41
mom? For example, I love my mom, but my mom's not over here necessarily in terms
55:45
of business. Okay, my mom's there. Okay, you guys are probably there. But here's
55:51
the thing. If you don't know each other very well, you've got people who are not
55:55
in here yet because you don't know what they know. Correct? There's a whole
55:58
resource you haven't accessed. All right. Business. Anyone in the room in
56:02
business potential do business together like buy, sell?
56:06
By the way, you might do, right? Yeah. with each other. You might, but you
56:10
might also start to recommend each other. Correct. Okay. Every single
56:14
person. All right. You guys doing business already?
56:19
Ah, nice. Okay. But if you're partners, if you're business partners, you might
56:24
be there. This is more the financial side of
56:28
business. Referrals, leads, buying, selling is more there. That might be the
56:34
support. Okay. So, you can double high five there. All right. All right, here
56:38
we go. All right, so what's the best relationship? If you could go out there,
56:43
remember I said you you can only have about 150 relationships, right?
56:48
What you need to do is build an inner circle of about 50,
56:51
right? Those 50 you carry with you on speed dial. Those are the ones we focus
56:56
our time and energy on. Would that make sense? Because honestly, you don't have
57:00
time to do these, right? So, where would be the best for the 150 to be on there?
57:07
Bang. So now whenever we meet somebody, what
57:12
could be going through your brain? Yeah. Which category they fall in? So
57:18
every single person we meet while we're having a conversation about business
57:21
cards and football and what they do for a living in your brain, you're starting
57:25
to do this. They don't know it. It's because they don't they've never done
57:29
this. But you, me, I'm doing this. How do these people slot into my future?
57:35
So what we're doing is we're building a mental machine based on what you want to
57:40
achieve in your life and business and the people that you need to be around
57:45
that help you going to achieve it. Does that make sense?
57:50
Okay. Now I'm going to give you one thing that's really really important as
57:54
we go on to the next bit. What I want you to do is we're going to have a bit
57:57
of an exercise. If you want to close your eyes, close
58:01
your eyes. If you don't, just try and imagine your eyes aren't open. But what
58:04
I'd like you to do is just imagine you in 10 years. There's a big empty
58:11
room. So imagine there's a big empty room.
58:14
Big empty room. And we're 10 years in the future.
58:20
And in that room is everything that you're trying to achieve through Teta,
58:26
through everything. Where do you want to be in 10 years time? What's happening in
58:29
your life? What is happening in your life? What's
58:35
your health? What are your travels? What is your business? How many businesses?
58:40
Okay, is it looking good? And you're there. Now, that room has a oneway door,
58:47
which means anybody who comes into that room with you is going to be with you
58:52
for the next 10 years. anyone any all people every single
59:00
person is either supporting us and helping us or pulling us back. There is
59:05
no in between everybody. They help us they pull us back. So my question is who
59:12
would you have in your room? Who's in your room for the next 10
59:17
years? That make sense? That's what we're
59:22
starting to do here today. You can open your eyes if you want, but this is what
59:25
we're starting to do. That door, this course is the filter that you're saying,
59:30
right? You can come in my room and you you're lovely. Maybe we'll have
59:36
a drink, maybe we'll have a coffee, but in terms of business, no. Do you know
59:40
what I mean? Because we don't have time. There's millions of people out there.
59:45
Right. One more thing. Remember I said there's only two ways of getting things
59:49
done. Money or goodwill through people. So my question is, I want you to think
59:55
about this. If you're trying to build this room with all these people in there
59:58
helping you, whose room are you in?
1:00:07
Whose room are you in? Because if you're not positive, if you're not helping, if
1:00:11
you're you haven't got these resources, if you're not willing to get them, why
1:00:14
would they have you in your room in their room
1:00:18
at the moment? Potentially, you are all in each other's room. Potentially, it's
1:00:23
for you to decide whether you're a valuable member of that community
1:00:27
because if you're not, you're gone. Just a different way of
1:00:32
looking at it. Nice. But I promise you, as an entrepreneur,
1:00:36
there is absolutely nothing like having a group of people that lift you up.
1:00:41
Amazing. I remember when COVID came. Everyone remember COVID? Probably
1:00:45
weren't in business at the time. Some of you might have been, eh? Yeah, you were.
1:00:54
Brilliant. Good for you. Maybe I got my orange
1:00:57
juice from you. Maybe.
1:00:59
Maybe. Yeah. Okay. Although I was a bit Okay.
1:01:05
But my point is Yeah. Um that was a long time back. Yeah. So um for lost my train
1:01:11
of thought there. We've lost her. Okay. Right. Let's move
1:01:16
on. So here's the secret to getting this done. The number one secret for
1:01:20
networking is the mechanism to make it work is
1:01:25
helping each other. People think it's being good at what
1:01:30
they sell. Let me tell you the dynamic around this. So just for one second,
1:01:34
imagine I've invited you for a cup of coffee. We
1:01:38
go for a cup of coffee. We have a lovely chat and we leave. Next time, what are
1:01:45
you thinking? It sorry, it's your turn to invite me
1:01:51
for a coffee. How many people would think it's my turn?
1:01:55
Not many of you. Okay. Interesting. Okay. What if I bought you two cups of
1:02:00
coffee and you still hadn't bought me a cup of coffee?
1:02:03
Right now, you're starting to feel there's an imbalance. If you're not
1:02:06
feeling there's an imbalance, networking might be a problem. Okay?
1:02:12
Because as a human being we need to find balance. Okay. So the concept is if I'm
1:02:17
helping you, if I'm buying this as a human being, you need to find balance.
1:02:21
That's why giving is so important. Networking is not about taking
1:02:27
and you can do that strategically. You can do it strategically. Yeah. Okay. But
1:02:32
giving as a network, if you're here as a community wanting to help each other,
1:02:36
more is going to happen, right? So if you give out good energy, it just comes
1:02:40
back. Anyone here believe in energy? 100%. All right. Okay. We need to move
1:02:46
on a little bit. By the way, most people think this is networking. I'm not going
1:02:49
to spend too much time on it today. Where's my little thing? Okay. There you
1:02:53
go. If you think this is networking, you're mistaken.
1:02:59
So, networking is not just handing out business cards. That's handing out
1:03:03
business cards. Networking stop. Networking is what happens next. That's
1:03:08
what we're looking at. The business card is just your details. It's everything we
1:03:12
can do. Right. Quickly, sales, networking, marketing, all hit this.
1:03:18
Okay, we're going to be doing more of this as we go forward. Okay, I'm going
1:03:21
to be showing the dynamics. What's the most powerful things there for you as
1:03:24
entrepreneurs looking to close deals? This one.
1:03:36
Every brings you closer to S. Now, there's a little there's a difference
1:03:39
between sales and networking because sales is about closing them, right?
1:03:44
Yeah. Networking is on the other side, which is the introduction. But here's
1:03:47
the thing. When people go networking, what do they do normally?
1:03:55
Yeah. Hi, here's my business card. Buy from me. And if they don't want to buy,
1:03:58
go a waste of time. Next, right? Only 2% on the first go. And at networking
1:04:03
events, most people won't buy. If you're going to keep going,
1:04:10
there's more chance. So, when we talk about networking groups later on, one of
1:04:13
the things is to keep going back. The magic in networking, number one, they
1:04:18
may never buy from you. But if they get to know and like you, they might start
1:04:24
to think, how can I help you? Because they like you. They cycle with you or
1:04:28
you're in Teta together. This is why networking is so different to sales. But
1:04:32
these stats are the same. marketing, networking, sales. All right, biggest
1:04:36
mistake people make that's transactional networking. This is relational
1:04:41
networking. You understand the difference? We'll do more on that. The
1:04:45
other secret to networking is the boomerang, which is that keep coming
1:04:48
back. So, wherever you go, keep coming back. Our best friends, we keep coming
1:04:52
back, right? We don't meet our best friend on one occasion, we keep coming
1:04:56
back. That's how we do it. There's loads of people you met once and said, "Nah."
1:05:00
Same with networking. All right. number one skill of a networker after giving.
1:05:05
So giving is the most is the fundamental one. Does anyone know what the most
1:05:09
number one important skill is? Excuse me.
1:05:13
Communicating is an important one. Ask is a good one.
1:05:19
Storytelling. Nice. Confidence.
1:05:23
Asking more. You're all good, huh? Excuse me.
1:05:33
being charismatic. Last one. Converting.
1:05:40
Okay, nice. Okay, we're going to move on. Everything you said is valid. Every
1:05:43
single one of them is valid. But here's the thing.
1:05:47
All that is lovely, but what if you don't follow up?
1:05:54
So, I met you. We had a great conversation. I go home.
1:05:59
Move on. We had a great conversation about working together. We had a great
1:06:02
conversation about cycling. And all I do is throw your card in the bin or forget
1:06:06
it and move on. Was that a good use of my time?
1:06:10
All right. So, the number one skill for a networker is making sure after the
1:06:14
event, when you've got the details, when you shook their hand, you follow up in
1:06:17
an appropriate manner to take that relationship forward. Right now, not
1:06:22
everyone is going to be useful. Remember that. We've spoken about that already.
1:06:26
But we still follow up. Why? to we may not want to build a
1:06:33
relationship because we've decided maybe they're not. But it's part of our
1:06:57
Yeah, it's it's very true. I mean, I always say to a lot of people I network
1:07:01
with, and it's funny, they'll come once and they'll come a third time and they
1:07:04
go, "Oh, you all know what I do." And what they'll do is not bother coming
1:07:07
back because they think everybody will know them. And I'll guarantee you if you
1:07:12
don't turn up, somebody equally lovely, equally as good as what they do will
1:07:16
turn up and they'll meet them. So you're right, it's doing that. But anyway,
1:07:20
that's beside the point. So the number one is followup. That means doing
1:07:23
something. Okay? So a simple follow-up, by the way, might just be nice to meet
1:07:27
you. Hope to see you soon. If you've decided there's no connection, okay, but
1:07:32
for someone that's more important, you do more. Imagine you met Richard Branson
1:07:36
and he said reach out. what you can do. Throw the business card
1:07:40
in the in the bin. Forget because I can't be bothered. You make it happen.
1:07:44
Right? So, here's here's a very basic one for you. We'll do more of this in
1:07:48
more detail. I'm trying to give you the tools just now so we can get going.
1:07:51
Okay? Give you some tools. So, number one, within 48 hours, whoever business
1:07:55
card you've got, whatever details you've got, you send them a message, nice to
1:07:59
meet you. Send them something that makes you credible.
1:08:05
Okay? If they said to you, "Please send me your sales information." Send it. If
1:08:10
they didn't ask for anything, you just say, "Nice to meet you. See you soon."
1:08:15
Imagine receiving that. It's nice, right? You just spent 10 minutes of my
1:08:18
life with me. It's nice that you appreciated it. So, we follow up. Could
1:08:22
be a WhatsApp, could be an email, whatever. Within seven days,
1:08:28
this is another way of not being forgotten.
1:08:31
connect on social media on the appropriate channel. Okay, so you
1:08:36
connect with them on social media in the appropriate way. What happens then?
1:08:40
Because we don't all have the time to see each other, but in six months time
1:08:44
you might pop up on their profile and they go, "Oh yeah, that person I met."
1:08:48
Okay, brilliant way of visibility. Okay, so not about selling, just stay
1:08:52
invisible. And the last one is if it's important for your business, make sure
1:08:56
you book in a meeting and go and meet them physically to what you said, my
1:09:00
friend, which is take that on. Okay? You would not believe 99.9% of people that
1:09:06
go networking never follow up. Never. And they'll tell me they're
1:09:12
brilliant networkers. Okay?
1:09:16
Uh, one of the ways you can do this, by the way, is to automate your follow-up.
1:09:23
48 hours before.
1:09:25
Oh golly. Yeah, good question. Before 48 hours. I personally do it within the
1:09:29
day. No, not really.
1:09:35
Again, it just depends on the message. Yeah. And your energy and all that sort
1:09:39
of stuff. But I what I do after I've been to an event, I schedule half an
1:09:43
hour afterwards to do all my follow-ups and then it's done.
1:10:01
Say it again. Sorry. Yes.
1:10:06
Yes. Yeah. But the chances are they won't
1:10:13
connect with you because they're the 99.9% that do
1:10:17
nothing. So this is the secret with the networking. You need to take control of
1:10:21
this. They've never been in this room. They don't know how important it is. You
1:10:26
do. So this dynamic, this introduction, this exchange of business cards and
1:10:30
information, you take control. Make sure you follow up. Make sure you connect
1:10:33
with them and make sure you control this. Don't leave it to them. They'll
1:10:37
never do it. Does that help? Excuse me.
1:10:42
Yeah. Because they won't. And if they do, all they'll do is sell at you.
1:10:47
How do you know it's the right person? Do you feel that or you have to ask?
1:10:52
We'll do this questioning later. Okay. I'll teach you a framework for
1:10:56
questioning. I'll give you all that afterwards as
1:11:03
well. Yeah.
1:11:09
Which one? The followup. You decide.
1:11:11
So, here's the thing. also decide the forum because I'm very conscious if I
1:11:16
meet a lady I won't follow up on Facebook and connect with her because
1:11:20
it's a bit creepy right okay it's a bit creepy but on LinkedIn
1:11:24
it's fine because that's a professional forum nice to meet you blah blah blah
1:11:28
blah but that's different to connecting on so you got to just think about these
1:11:31
things okay um anyway we'll spend more on that this is the scorecard this is
1:11:36
what I want to leave you with right so you're going to get this will be on your
1:11:39
LMS it's it's on an excel sheet so for all the tech wizards in the room, I
1:11:43
apologize for that. We're going old school. You can print this off. You can
1:11:46
do it on Excel. You can design an app and give it to me. It's up to you. Just
1:11:50
saying. Okay. But all it is is a scorecard. It's quite simple. Okay.
1:11:55
These are just activities. Uh you're going to have it all. I promise you. But
1:11:59
if you want to take a picture, I'll get out of the way. Okay. There's two of
1:12:03
these sheets. I'll give you the other one in a second. Let me explain it. I
1:12:06
have a video that I can also send to you as well.
1:12:10
that's on YouTube with me explaining this a lot slower.
1:12:13
Okay? And if you want to do that, you can watch that video as well. Okay? All
1:12:18
I would say there's a couple of activities on the video that are not on
1:12:23
here because we don't have the time to go into that on your course and I didn't
1:12:27
feel it was fair to put that on there. So, if you're going through the video
1:12:31
and there's something not on there, don't worry about it. Just move on. Is
1:12:35
that okay? All right. So the idea of this is two
1:12:40
things. The scorecard number one, it keeps you visible with the people you
1:12:45
need to be meeting. Okay? It gives you an activity sheet. You remember the
1:12:48
giving and helping. This is a giving and helping scorecard.
1:12:53
But what you do is you focus it on the people you meet. Each other,
1:12:58
these guys, the professors, anyone that's influential, plus anyone you you
1:13:03
meet that goes into your machine. You start to focus this. So this is a
1:13:07
relationship goodwill building tool. It's also a you marketing tool. How do
1:13:13
you market yourself through networking and referrals? Okay. What I want you to
1:13:18
think about um let's just say this is Richard Branson for an example. He
1:13:23
doesn't know you, doesn't care, right? True. But if you have a
1:13:28
conversation with him and now you imagine buying Richard Branson a cup of
1:13:31
coffee, he's going to be like, "That's nice. Someone else is trying to get
1:13:35
stuff from me. Right. So imagine now you start to do a
1:13:39
couple of things for Richard without expecting anything back. What's
1:13:42
happening in Richard's mind? He's starting to find balance, right?
1:13:46
Maybe I could bung him a couple of million dollars. Okay,
1:13:50
whatever. But all these things are ways of building and they're quite different.
1:13:54
Okay, so for example, you send somebody a WhatsApp and you just say, "Nice to
1:13:58
meet you the other day. See you soon." Right? Every time you send that
1:14:03
WhatsApp, we got every time you send that WhatsApp, for example, let's say
1:14:07
you're on Sunday, you send two, right? You put two there, it'll times two by
1:14:14
two, it'll give you four points. Let's say uh
1:14:20
you send a message to one of your friends and just say, um, fancy going
1:14:23
out for a drink or happy birthday. Okay, same thing. You sent a message, you get
1:14:30
points. gentleman said to me, "How do I reactivate my network?" All right, think
1:14:34
about someone you haven't seen and send them a WhatsApp. How are you? This is
1:14:39
this one. Make a how are you? Right. Haven't seen
1:14:44
you for a while. Just wanted things going. How would you feel if someone
1:14:47
sent you that message? Good. Right. Oh, that's nice. Now,
1:14:53
suddenly you're thinking about them. This is such a cool tool. You wouldn't
1:14:58
believe how many times business has come from this. I saw my friend do this. I'm
1:15:03
not joking. He sent this out to someone. He says, "Um, how are you?" The person
1:15:08
responded and went, "Thank you so much for reaching out. I lost your number and
1:15:12
I have business to give you." I'm not joking.
1:15:17
Another guy did this and the guy reached out and said, "Oh, good, good. Oh, by
1:15:21
the way, nice to hear from. Can I do I remember you did exhibitions?" The guy
1:15:25
said, "Yeah." He says, "I've got a job for you in Oman."
1:15:31
Never would it happen without that. You honestly do this. It will blow your
1:15:34
mind. Okay. Maybe in business maybe a bit early for that, but it's great.
1:15:38
Okay. So, another one. Send an email or a what? It says email. Anything that's
1:15:43
email, WhatsApp, private message, whatever.
1:15:49
Yes. Great question. The how are you call is
1:16:04
all about energy going to them. You never try and get something back. So
1:16:08
it's not hey how are you? Can you buy my product?
1:16:11
That's a sales call. So what this is is energy or going in their direction not
1:16:16
taking. So what you've got is um imagine you my friend. All right. We
1:16:22
just met, right? Imagine now he's got an emotional bank account and I've got an
1:16:28
emotional bank account. And imagine I buy him a cup of coffee. I give him a
1:16:31
lift to the airport. Uh maybe give him a sandwich. Uh give him some advice. Give
1:16:36
him a give him some business. What's happening now is his emotional bank
1:16:39
account is filling up with goodwill towards me. Are you with me? So number
1:16:45
one, he's thinking, right, what can I do for Phil? But even if he can't, if I
1:16:48
turn round to him one day and said, "Look, mate, I got a problem. Would you
1:16:52
mind helping me out?" He'll be there go as a decent human being. He'll be going,
1:16:56
"Yes, I've been trying to find a way to help you.
1:17:01
Have you got me?" This is building that bank account. So, with that call, the
1:17:05
minute you go, "Hey, how are you? Can I take?" You've taken away from the bank
1:17:09
account you've taken out. It's all I given.
1:17:13
Okay. Yes,
1:17:25
you can call or message. Okay, there are some people who think
1:17:29
it's a bit weird. Why are you just calling me out of the
1:17:31
blue? So, what you what works for me? Um, hey John, just giving you a call. I
1:17:37
was going through my phone, your name popped up and I just wondered how life
1:17:40
was. Nothing more than that. Just wonder how things were going. You've got an
1:17:44
excuse so it's not creepy. Okay. Um, send a gift. Birthdays,
1:17:51
holidays, Eid, Christmas. Yeah. Um, most of these you can do for each other. So,
1:17:56
just practice doing this. All right. How are you? Phone calls. Simple. Um,
1:18:01
connecting somebody around a personal interest. If you meet somebody who has a
1:18:04
hobby, connecting two people together gets you
1:18:09
goodwill from both of them people. Are you with me? So imagine I know
1:18:14
someone who cycles and you might want to cycle. I can connect the two of you and
1:18:17
say hey while you're here do you want to cycle? You're like yes and by the way
1:18:20
he's got a bike. You're like great right? Both of you now think nice guy.
1:18:25
It's goodwill with two people not just one. The other one is connecting people
1:18:29
around business. You see you got points. Am I doing um last thing is this one the
1:18:34
asing relationship builders. There's a tag on the bottom. These are things you
1:18:39
can do to build relationships. So when you open it up there'll be a separate
1:18:42
tag. There'll be some tips on there. Okay. Uh, last one, as you can see,
1:18:46
getting somebody a speaking engagement, podcast, something like that. Can you
1:18:51
get somebody in your network an interview? How much are they going to
1:18:54
love you if they if you get them a podcast? Your bank account has just shot
1:18:58
up. All right. Over here, um, giving somebody a business referral,
1:19:04
attending a networking event. A referral source is somebody who might pass you
1:19:09
business, might help you. So, one trick for networking is to go with somebody.
1:19:13
By the way, especially if you're nervous, go with somebody else. So,
1:19:16
attending the event, you get more points with somebody. Attending on your own,
1:19:22
inviting somebody to go with you. That's good.
1:19:26
Okay. If they turn up, you get more points. Following up, you get points.
1:19:31
Um, two of you maybe organize an event together. You collaborate. This may be a
1:19:36
little bit early, but some guys in the last group actually organized an event.
1:19:40
Um, so did one of the girls. Um, inviting people, you get points. Turning
1:19:45
up, you get points. Social media shares, likes, comments. Okay? But remember, all
1:19:50
of this is doing stuff for other people. It's giving you visibility, but it makes
1:19:55
them feel good about you. Does that make sense? Right. This is all on the video
1:20:01
as well, so I'll resend it. And of course, if you have questions, you can
1:20:05
reach out through the the connect uh the guides and I'll help. Okay, this is the
1:20:10
relationship builders. It's all on the scorecode. Any questions, let me know.
1:20:14
All right, we need to quickly get on the quiz, right?
1:20:19
We were having such a great conversation earlier on. I threw a load of stuff. I
1:20:22
hope you don't mind. Yes.
1:20:29
Right. Good idea.
1:20:52
Now, as soon as you get it, so tomorrow, go and get this and start
1:24:06
I have leeway if if people can over Oh, we're off.
1:24:43
Send in the gift was nice. Send in Well done everybody. So time up but um
1:26:17
thanks for making this fun. Thanks for being interactive. Looking forward to
1:26:20
next. Okay.
1:26:35
Yeah, they didn't ask me for that. I will send whatever we have.
1:26:40
Yes.

Be unforgettable- "benefits versus Features" and the new world networking online
21/10/2025 | 12:00 PM - 01:30 PM
Mr. Phil Bedford
0:00
a little bit about what we talked about last week. So, uh, just quick quick bit
0:05
of a recap. If you remember, we were talking about behavioral styles last
0:08
week. The disc, the last session,
0:12
the last session. Okay. I just love to know if anyone's actually had
0:16
experiences of doing this live. Anybody actually thought about it? Let's
0:22
go with you. Yeah. I mean, now that you like Taylor,
0:25
it's like a joke like, "Oh, you're such an investor. D
0:30
this. So, it's cool. We've seen each other now. We started naming ourselves
0:34
like that. It's fun to see the personalities from people.
0:37
Yeah. Good stuff, mate. Yeah. Excellent. Uh, anyone else
0:42
considered it? Have you thought about your friends, your family? It's
0:46
interesting running through who you know and thinking who they are. Has anyone
0:49
tried it at a networking event yet? Considering the disc.
0:54
Yeah, tell me. I usually speak
1:02
So when I see people like just standing there and slowly I try to slow down and
1:08
perfect. Well done. Anyone else experiencing maybe the way you show up
1:13
with other people? How about you my friend with a hat?
1:24
Yeah. the thing I usually talk to
1:33
my breaking and yeah because you're quite confident
1:38
right you come across quite confident yeah so have you noticed that you have
1:42
to adapt slightly with the sort of more nervous people or not
1:47
I try good stuff
1:51
yes m I usually approach two people but I try
1:57
the one man I was exposing but was a bit like shy and didn't want to approach. So
2:02
I just stayed there seeing he approaches and then he approached to me and then we
2:06
start speaking. So like it was from him that started the conversation. Oh wow.
2:13
He was a bit more confident with that. Nice. Just cuz you changed. I love it.
2:16
Great stuff. Um how about you? Yes.
2:34
I take my time, you know what I mean? Yeah.
2:47
Okay. Okay. Yeah. A lot of it is just
2:51
realizing how we're acting with regards to them. You can't change the way they
2:55
behave, but just recognizing maybe you're too fast or you're too slow or
2:59
you're too scary or you're too silly, whatever it is, just it helps you to
3:03
adapt a little bit. Honestly, most most people, I promise you, most people have
3:07
never done this. Even people that have got businesses like 20, 30 years,
3:13
they've never done this. So, you're you're really entering with a big
3:16
advantage. Okay? So, just keep considering it, keep thinking about it.
3:21
Okay, Jitex, how did it go? Anyone thought it was brilliant? Anyone
3:26
thought it was a waste of time? I'd love to hear.
3:29
I thought the glo Okay. And what reason?
3:38
big spoke to more people
3:46
seemed interested to our business.
3:51
Ah so what the expand was great but
3:56
there was different
4:09
Interesting. Okay. So, the expand didn't serve your goal, but the other one did.
4:13
Great stuff. Great realization. Yeah. Because again, part of networking is
4:16
what works and what doesn't. Where should you be? Yes, mate.
4:20
Yeah. Okay.
4:27
Ies. Okay.
4:35
I'm I just met people
4:50
correct. Yes, ma'am.
5:00
Okay. CEOs or
5:04
Okay. to sales people. So you get more
5:16
business. Okay.
5:22
Oh, brilliant. The other way around.
5:23
Okay. But the commonality was you realized there's no point speaking to
5:27
the employees. You had to speak to the the bosses. That's the commonality,
5:30
right? Yeah. Because the the problem is with a lot of people when they think
5:34
about going networking, they think of exhibitions
5:39
because that's where all the people are. But what's your re but when we've talked
5:43
about networking, one of the key elements is going to a place that's the
5:46
right place but continually going, right? And of course, you can't do that
5:50
in an exhibition. Okay? So, you need a different strategy
5:54
there, right? The strategy has to be find the person in charge at the right
6:00
place. But did you notice they're not really open to big conversations on the
6:05
day? Do you know why?
6:10
What were they there for? Selling. They weren't there to meet you.
6:14
They weren't there to, you know, sell, you know, for you to buy from you to
6:19
them to buy from you. So, they were all selling. So they weren't really
6:22
interested in you unless you could make them interested in you. So yeah, well
6:27
spotted. Yeah, well done. Any about you guys over here? What about two lads at
6:31
the back? Hey guys, you two.
6:38
I got an opportunity to I like to
6:48
conver Some were very awkward.
6:52
Some were awkward. Why would Why were they awkward?
6:57
Nothing to talk about. Were they maybe the wrong people or not?
7:00
Yeah, maybe. Okay. So, what we were talking about
7:02
here that they might have been the employees?
7:06
Yeah. Okay. By the way, what um I I don't see many people. Was there anyone
7:12
here I spoke to at the event? Yeah. So, so what did we talk about
7:18
changing the way you presented these people? Would you remember
7:20
I asked you like for me it was very difficult to talk about the internships
7:24
that was at the north expand and you told me like because we had this batch
7:29
that says the student you told me to not say I'm a student I'm an entrepreneur
7:34
and then I started to do that people were were interested
7:36
changed right yes
7:38
okay so the minute so the problem was for a lot of people is they were going
7:41
there saying you know I'm a student with tattoo as good as that is they hear the
7:46
word student they think no money Right? And they also think you're not
7:51
going to buy anything. So immediately they switch off because they've been
7:54
told to sell to people with money. Right? So what you've did very well was
7:59
you turn around and said, "I'm a business owner.
8:02
I've got one business I'm working on now. I've got another I'm launching. I
8:06
just happen to be doing further studies at TA if they ask." Right. Suddenly now
8:11
they're interested. Okay. And it changed the dynamic. Right.
8:15
Yeah. Mate, don't you feel like
8:20
you let them know that you're not student that they want to sell you
8:23
something instead of for me to
8:35
well it can be but what you're right I think whichever way you go about this
8:40
you've got value um the challenge was they were trying to get through to the
8:44
decision maker right and so It was like, look, this
8:48
isn't the environment for me to talk to you because I know you're trying to sell
8:52
to people, but I would be interested in a collaborative conversation with the
8:55
owner. Can I get their details to talk about him on another day?
9:00
And because they saw you as a potential, then they were willing to give those
9:05
details. And then because nobody really wants to have an in-depth conversation
9:08
at Jitex, they just want next, next, next. So what you do is you say, "Look,
9:14
I'm someone that's worth talking to. I'll speak to you when this is over. And
9:18
that's what the conversation was. So, it was just a small tweak and for a lot of
9:23
the guys it seemed to work. Okay. So, I hope that helps a little bit. All right.
9:27
But yeah, all the conversations are valid. It just depends how you how you
9:31
do it. Okay. So, what we're going to come to in a minute is very similar.
9:35
It's is ultimately people are motivated by what? What's in it for them?
9:41
Okay. The people you're speaking to, what's in it for them to talk to you.
9:45
So, all you're doing is saying, "Look, I'm worth talking to." Okay. Once
9:49
they're listening, then you can take your agenda. Got it. Okay.
9:55
Scorecards. How we getting on? Yeah. Anyone fallen in love with the
10:01
scorecard yet? No. It wouldn't surprise me. Okay. Any experiences on the
10:05
scorecard? Yeah, mate. Oops.
10:11
Okay. WhatsApp.
10:15
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
10:31
Okay. Yeah. Well done. And by the way, guys in the corner, are you making notes
10:35
or are you listening? Okay. It's just just to bring you back in the room. You
10:39
shouldn't need your mobile phones unless you're making notes just for this hour
10:42
in a bit. Okay. Um All right. Yes, mate. Yeah.
11:04
Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah. Well done. Awesome. Okay. So, just
11:08
so just quickly in the first couple of weeks when you had this, it's really
11:12
just starting to learn to ride the bicycle. Okay. You're just getting the
11:17
scorecards, recognizing what you're doing, trying to
11:20
do more. Okay. from now onwards. You know the second sheet which says give me
11:27
details. You need to do that. Okay, the second
11:31
sheet because to be honest with you, it's too easy to cheat.
11:36
You could just put in 1111 444 and then there's a score and it's woohoo. Okay,
11:42
but that's cheating because you cheat yourself and you and it doesn't do
11:45
anything. With the second sheet, I now want details on what you were doing.
11:51
Okay. So, the first couple of weeks it was just about you doing it. Now, we
11:56
need to see what you're doing. Is that fair enough?
12:00
So, please make sure make sure you do that. Okay. So, the scores for this and
12:05
then more importantly, as you just shared, a big part of this is going to
12:09
be what's changed for you since when you started to now. That's what I want to
12:15
really see. Okay. Do you remember in the first
12:19
session when we talked about um Paul Rivere and William Doors? Do you
12:26
remember that? Yeah. You remember that? Do you remember
12:29
my friend? We talked in the first session about Paul Rivere and William
12:32
Doors. What did Paul River do? people.
12:46
Well done. And ultimately, what did he do?
12:50
Did he change the world, right? What did William Doors do?
12:57
Pretty much nothing. Right. So my question is today are you
13:01
going this way or this way based on this? Are you moving this way
13:07
in which is life becomes easier because I'm learning how to build relationships
13:12
and build my network or it's just a silly thing with a scorecard. I can't be
13:17
bothered. Your choice. Okay. Both ways work. You need more money this way and
13:23
this way things just get easier. Your choice. Okay. Does make make sense?
13:27
Okay. It's worth a check in sometimes because sometimes we forget when we're
13:31
doing this what what it's all about. And it's ultimately about making your life
13:35
easier. Not necessarily today, but in six months or two years when you need
13:40
it, you'll have it. If you haven't done the work, then you won't have it. Simple
13:46
as that. Hope that helps a little bit, right? Okay. Okay. So, what we're going
13:50
to look at now is the following. Um many of you have experienced going
13:56
networking correct right and you meet somebody and it's like hi and you have a
14:01
chat. At some point they will say to you what do you do?
14:07
Okay. And we have to be able to answer that in a way that does what? What do we
14:14
want them to do when we've done our 20 seconds?
14:18
Take interest. Take an interest in me. Yeah.
14:36
So they they take an interest number one.
14:38
Okay. What else would I want him to do, my friend?
14:44
Excuse me. Be intrigued.
14:46
Be intrigued. Want to know more? I like it. Anything else?
14:52
What's an outcome from this conversation?
14:57
A meeting maybe. Yeah. Is it possible I'm he'll never buy from
15:03
me? Right. So, is it fair to say when we
15:08
talk the first thing I want him to do is understand what I do?
15:14
If he doesn't understand what I do, what can't he do?
15:18
He can't buy from me. What else? Can't refer me.
15:22
He can't refer me to somebody else. Okay, well done. So, the thing is with
15:27
this with what we're doing here, if we remember, do you remember this?
15:37
Do you remember that? Do you remember what VCP was?
15:49
profitability. Profitability, right? Okay. So, remember
15:53
this describes your relationship with every single person you meet on the
15:57
planet. Every single person you meet, right? So,
16:03
when somebody's visible, what does that mean in terms of business?
16:09
Sorry. Okay. They can see you and hear you.
16:15
Okay. What else? You're known to people.
16:20
You what? Sorry. You're known to people.
16:22
You're describe known to. What do you mean? What do they know about you?
16:26
They know about your brand. You're on the right track. Yeah. So,
16:31
they they probably know your name and they understand what you do. Is that
16:35
fair to say? They know your name.
16:39
They understand what you do and they probably want to know more. Correct.
16:44
Right. in terms of business. If they know that, then you're now visible.
16:51
If I don't know you, if I don't understand what you do in terms of
16:55
buying and business, are you invisible or visible?
17:01
You're invisible. If someone is standing in front of you, you can see them, but
17:05
if you don't understand what they do, you can't buy from them or refer them or
17:09
help them, you're invisible. Does that make sense?
17:13
Credible means trustworthy.
17:17
Yeah, they're trustworthy. You'll be willing to refer or net. And profitable
17:20
means they'll buy, they'll refer, they'll help on a consistent basis.
17:25
Okay. So, when we go networking, what we're doing is this is a funnel is
17:30
basically we're doing that with every person we meet.
17:36
There's a person, right? What we're doing with every single person is trying
17:41
to become visible with them. Does that make sense?
17:49
So if you can be visible with thousands of people and they all remember you,
17:55
what do you think the chances of getting business going forward?
17:59
Referrals, help. Yeah, this makes sense, right? You need to become visible with
18:04
as many people as possible who remember you so you can get help. get referrals,
18:09
get connections. It's a similar thing to marketing, right? What's marketing
18:13
spending money so people understand what you do. This is ex but networking. The
18:18
difference is we need to explain. This is the marketing. Does that make sense?
18:22
Right? So, what we're going to do today is make sure that you're able to explain
18:26
what you do in a way that people understand. Right? The biggest problem
18:31
you're going to have is the more you understand your business, the more
18:37
difficult it is to explain it to other people.
18:41
Do you know why? Because you know the technicality and
18:46
the other people don't understand but you forget how they think
18:51
you before knowing that. Yeah, I got what you're saying. The more
18:55
you know, the more you assume other people know,
18:58
which means you've already left them behind. Okay? So, we need to dumb it
19:02
down. Okay? Well done. Okay. So, let's look at this next bit then. So, there's
19:08
two times that we introduce ourselves networking. One one is oneonone and the
19:13
other one is when what shows up? Oh, that's the follow-up. Yeah. So the
19:22
other time you might share what you do. Has anyone here ever been to a
19:27
networking event where they say stand up and share what you do?
19:31
What happened? Who was that? Sorry.
19:35
Yeah. What was the dynamics? What happened?
19:39
The microphone, right? So they gave the microphone to
19:43
each person and you stand up and you go, "Hi, my name's Phil and I do this and
19:48
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah." And there's
19:51
60 people. What happens to the 60 people?
19:55
They're gone. Right. Okay. So, you've got 60 people there. If all of those 60
20:03
leave the room understanding what you do and believing you're good at it, is that
20:07
good for your business? Right? If you're just standing up going,
20:11
"Hi, my name's and one person leaves, how much business
20:18
have you lost? a lot, right? So, today is about how do
20:25
you get everyone in that room to at least understand what you do and then
20:30
the people that are interested will say, "Let's talk." The others doesn't matter.
20:37
Make sense? All right. So, this is what we're going to do. Okay. Part of this
20:42
conversation is this. when we're trying to get people interested. Now, going
20:47
back to Jitex, do you remember at Jitex when we changed your your introduction,
20:52
we moved into benefits for them. What's in it for
20:56
them? Because suddenly they thought they could sell to you. Does that make sense?
21:01
Right. People only buy People are only motivated with two things. What are they
21:04
motivated by? Excuse me.
21:07
What's in it for them? What's in it for them? Yep.
21:11
So take what's in it for them and split it by two things.
21:15
Beautiful. Pain and pleasure. People are motivated by moving away from pain and
21:21
towards pleasure. Okay. So this is that
21:27
right? What's the pain here? I get wet.
21:32
All right. Rain is the feature. The benefit or pain is I get wet. Okay. Here
21:37
in Dubai is the sun. Okay. So when people buy, they don't buy because the
21:41
cloth looks nice. They buy because it keeps them right. So when we're
21:45
introducing ourselves today, somehow we have to work it. So we're talking about
21:49
this how you're stopping them from getting wet. Does that make sense? All
21:55
right. So as we do this then um while we're
22:00
talking about this, you can imagine you're talking to an individual. It's
22:04
similar to if we're talking to a group. Okay? For the sake of today, for the
22:10
moment, we're going to focus on this, but it is still very very similar to
22:15
this. Okay. Now, how many of you sell more than one thing?
22:21
You've only got one thing to sell or you have many.
22:24
How many have you got? How many sell?
22:27
Yeah. How many products or services do you have?
22:29
Unlimited. Unlimited.
22:32
Okay. So, give me what? One product. Welcome gifts. welcome gift.
22:43
So what I'm saying is the people who buy from you might be completely different
22:46
in their demographics. Would that be fair to say?
23:02
Absolutely. So those people would be in completely different networking groups.
23:07
Right? So if you if you if you're trying to sell the young and hip and you turn
23:11
up at the grandfather's networking event, you're wasting your time. Right?
23:15
What we would do is pitch the other business. You got me? So basically what
23:19
you want to do with any group is say number one, what's the lowest common
23:23
denominator? So the lowest common denominator means what do the most of
23:28
the people have in common? What do most of the people have in
23:33
common? What what's something you all have in
23:36
common? Tell you you're a tella, right? Um,
23:44
so if I went to a women's networking group, what do they have all in common?
23:49
Women, right? Women entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs.
23:54
Okay. What else would they have in common?
23:57
Business owners. Business owners. What else would they
24:00
have in common? A large majority. They want to grow.
24:04
They want to grow. What's a pain they have in common? Do you know?
24:08
You may be a bit young for this. Female business owners who run a business,
24:14
what do you think some of their biggest pains might be?
24:17
Balancing being a mum with running a business. Okay. Because historically the
24:22
women would look after the home while the guy's out. Historically may not be
24:26
the case now, but it often is. Right? So, when we're doing this, again, what
24:31
we're going to look at in a minute is the service. But if you can find out
24:34
what the lowest common denominator is, what this does is it allows you to
24:38
change your presentation so that more people in the room understand what
24:43
you're talking about. So, if how many people played underwater hockey with me
24:48
the other day? Okay, well done you guys. Okay. Now, so if I'm going to tell you a
24:53
story about what I'm selling, and what I would like you to do is
25:00
imagine you're playing underwater hockey. You've got the puck. You know
25:03
how much it weighs. Do you remember? You remember how heavy it is?
25:07
All right. So, how many of you know what I'm
25:09
talking about? The weight of it, right? The rest of you, I've lost you.
25:15
Okay? Which means there's only a small group in the room that can understand
25:18
what I'm talking about. So, the lowest common denominator is not underwater
25:22
hockey. A Yeah, I could use something else. How
25:26
many of you have ever been on an airplane?
25:30
You've ever been on an airplane? Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Lowest common
25:35
denominator. We got another one. Okay. So, if I can if I want to engage you, I
25:40
try and engage something that you all understand, not something you don't.
25:44
Does that make sense? So with any room, what's the what's the
25:48
connection points they have? Okay. All right. Number two, which product or
25:52
service would I sell to a group of young entrepreneurs who are at Teta.
25:58
Does that make sense? Okay.
26:05
What's the benefit to you guys? So what is the benefit to the target market of
26:09
what I'm selling? Okay. You're young entrepreneurs. You're
26:14
all here with tattoo. You're all open to learning, which is great. You're open to
26:18
learning, right? Oh, thank goodness. Okay. So many people
26:22
aren't, right? Okay. So, we've got a a load of entrepreneurs who are open and
26:28
willing to invest in learning. Okay. What's what products or service I could
26:33
sell my Incentive Pro? For example, I have a course that teaches entrepreneurs
26:37
how to network. Imagine you hadn't signed up for this
26:41
course. Okay? Imagine you didn't know me.
26:46
Okay. Pain or story.
26:50
Okay. So, this is how I'm going to introduce myself to you.
26:54
And then there's a call to action and they'll ask into the contact details.
26:58
So, I'm going to go back down to here. So, I'm going to introduce myself to you
27:04
because I've I've done some research. Entrepreneurs. Teta. You're willing to
27:08
learn entrepreneurs. Okay. So the way I can introduce you is to try
27:13
and wake you up. If everybody remember when we had the you're in a room with 30
27:19
other business owners, each person stood up and gone, "Hello, my name is John and
27:24
I I'm a lawyer and I I'm really good at what I do and I've been a lawyer for 30
27:29
years and and Hi, my name's David and I'm an
27:34
accountant. Hello, I'm a hairdresser. Hello, I'm this." And you guys are doing
27:38
what? losing interest, right? Instead, we
27:44
stand to say, did you know 97% of business owners say they rely heavily
27:53
on word of mouth and networking to get the best clients.
27:58
Only 3% actually have a plan to do anything
28:02
about that. That means 97% of their business is
28:06
coming by chance. Can I ask you a question? As
28:11
entrepreneurs, would you rather grow your business on chance or on a system
28:16
that is proven to work? Hands up if you prefer a system that's proven to work.
28:21
My name is Phil Bedford and I've spent my life developing a proven system that
28:26
can double or triple your clients today. If anyone would like to have a
28:30
conversation about that, just raise your business card and when you leave here,
28:34
just pop your business card on the table and I'll make sure I reach out to you.
28:38
finish. So, the people that want this will do
28:43
that. The people that don't won't. I've now got the clients that I can work with
28:48
and the other guys are a waste of time. Don't want them anyway. You got me?
28:53
Simple. 20 seconds. Was that approximately? So, we're going to get
28:57
you to do something similar. Or I could have stood up and said, "Hi,
29:02
my name's Phil. Um, I've got a business and I do training and I like to teach
29:08
people how to network and um, yeah, I've been in Dubai for a long time and I
29:13
really recommend you work with me. Rubbish. Right. Which way do you want to
29:21
go? So, we're going to work on this one for you. Sweet.
29:25
Okay. So, what I'm going to ask you to do, I'm going to give you um, what's the
29:29
time? We start at 2:30, do we? Okay. I'm going to give you five minutes.
29:34
Okay, you're going to get five minutes each just to sit down and focus on which
29:39
product you're going to sell from your business.
29:43
Okay, I'm going to give you a couple of tips.
29:47
Start with ah this
29:52
start there. So what you want to do is we do not
29:58
start with our name. You need to start with an attention
30:04
grabber. Remember, if 20 or 30 people have been
30:09
standing up going, "Hello, my name is, hello, my name is." Everybody's falling
30:13
asleep. Nobody can buy for you, they can't buy
30:18
from you if they don't understand what you do. But they can't even do this if
30:22
they're not listening. Make sense?
30:26
So the first what you can do to wake people up is do something like um
30:33
did you know you can ask a question?
30:40
Okay statistics did you know 97%. Or you could say something like imagine.
30:49
Imagine you are.
30:55
Okay. When you use the word imagine, do you know what happens?
31:00
No, you're on it. Say it again. They imagine.
31:03
They imagine. Yeah. When you say imagine that and you
31:06
tell them what to imagine, they start to do a picture in their head. Okay. And
31:10
remember when they build their own picture they start to understand.
31:15
Okay. So the word imagine is super super powerful. All right. So this is how we
31:20
start. But then you can build in what your what your service is and what
31:27
problem it solves to your target market. Does that make sense?
31:32
Let me give you another one. I did one for a lawyer.
31:36
Okay. Did you know lawyers when they get to a certain point in their life many
31:40
lawyers if they want to make partner they have to start bringing in clients.
31:44
Do you know that? Okay. But the problem is lawyers don't
31:48
like to do business development. Would you agree?
31:52
And they're not very good at it. Okay. So I had a
31:59
lawyer. Okay. I'm at a networking event. There's lawyers.
32:04
The product I want to sell is Incentive Pro.
32:07
Okay, that's similar to what you guys have been doing, but about another 30
32:11
hours. Okay, incentive pro is the product.
32:17
The problem is the lawyer needs to make partner and get clients, but sales is
32:22
not their strength. Does that make sense?
32:26
Okay, here's a story I had. True story. Diana, who's um one of my lawyer
32:33
friends, she was one of my clients. She was a lawyer, needed to get results. As
32:38
a result of working with me, within
32:42
three months, she hit her yearly targets, and she was also able to bring
32:47
in leads for five of her lawyers from working with me. Okay. Okay. And there's
32:52
my ask. Okay. All right.
32:58
Okay. So, um, okay. You guys know we're having a break
33:03
in a minute. Yeah. What? You okay?
33:06
Yeah. I come back. Oh, please go on. Go, go, go. Okay. All
33:10
right. Okay. So, this is an example. Lowest common denominator. Rumor
33:16
lawyers. Okay. What do I want to sell to them? Incentive pro.
33:21
Hands up. How many of you lawyers in the room today want to make partners soon?
33:25
Hands go up. Do you know how you're going to do it? No idea.
33:32
I'd like to tell you about a story about Diana who owns a business, who owns a a
33:36
legal firm. She signed up for my program, Ascentive Pro. Within 10 weeks,
33:41
uh, sorry, within one month, she'd already closed a whole year's worth of
33:46
her business, and she was able to feed the rest of her clients, um, the rest of
33:51
her lawyers with a load of clients. and she developed a system that she could
33:57
use forever. Okay, if any of you lawyers here today would like to learn how to do
34:02
that, then just leave your name on here. Okay, that's a networking call. Or I'm
34:08
looking for introductions to lawyers who would rather make partner rather than
34:12
wish they didn't. If you know any lawyers that are
34:15
complaining about needing to make partner, that's a great introduction for
34:18
me. Okay, so you can build it that way, right? Going back,
34:24
call to action. What could be a good call to action
34:29
from a group like this? What's a good call to action?
34:38
Exactly what you're doing, by the way. Okay. So, what I could do is I could put
34:43
a QR code up here, and the call to action could be, if you're interested in
34:47
knowing more about that, scan the QR code. And they put it up and they scan
34:51
it. Okay. It could be uh just raise your hands. I got one, two, three. Okay. I'll
34:57
speak to you afterwards. Okay. Another one could be leave your business cards
35:02
on here. You with me? A call to action is do something. Yeah. And then of
35:07
course follow up at the top. All right. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm
35:11
going to give you two or three minutes to stand up because I know we're on the
35:14
after lunch and I can see some of you already having trouble with that. So
35:17
what I'm going to do, give you five minutes to get up and have a run and
35:20
wake up. Is that okay? But 5 minutes is 5 minutes, please. Okay. So, it's now 10
35:25
past. So, quarter past. Is that okay? Quarter past and we're back in the room.
35:30
Jump up, move around, wake up, do something. Yeah.
35:34
I have a question with the assignments because it says here referral source
35:39
notes. Uh time like what do you refer with time here? Not time or just
35:45
explaining what we do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, more importantly,
35:49
it's just tell notes about what happened.
35:51
Okay. Right. And what was the result?
35:53
Okay. It's more I'm more interested in that.
35:55
What happened? What was the result? I don't necessarily need cost and stuff.
35:58
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't really matter.
36:01
What? Give me deep. So, if you tell me I got 20 points from this. Okay. What was
36:05
it? Yeah.
36:11
Call to action. Contact is not that busy.
36:13
Yeah. That's so And your call to actions. Give me a call afterwards.
36:16
Here's my contact details. Okay. Like
36:19
follow up. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you're doing a onetoone one, you
36:24
still do this and you can say, "Well, look, that's the kind of people I'm
36:28
looking forward to meet. And by the way, here's my business card."
36:31
Or give me your business card. Um, I had a question. I had like nine
36:36
internship opportunities at Jex. What? Say
36:39
I got nine internship. Oh, wow. Congrats.
36:42
Um, but sometimes when you follow up, they don't respond. Is that normal or?
36:47
Yes, it's very normal. Yeah.
36:49
Do you know why? Because it's not really the place to get
36:53
internships. Maybe you followed up straight away.
36:55
Yeah. Within a day. Within the 24 hours. Okay. So, I would tell you it's probably
37:00
because what happens when they finish geeks, they're going to have 300 leads.
37:03
Yeah. And they'll be going through them and
37:06
check and you're probably on the back burner.
37:08
Okay. So, I wouldn't take it personally. You've done your bit, which is very
37:12
efficient. Give them a chance to go through it and
37:15
then maybe give them a call or just drop him a note. Say, "Hey, just wonder if
37:18
you had a chance to see my email." Makes sense.
37:21
Yeah. I got left on.
37:24
Was that? No, I got left on scene. Same.
37:26
Same way. Same way. No, naturally. It's not.
37:28
Yeah. It makes sense, but it's just I don't know. It feels weird because if
37:33
you think about it, I would like respond. It feels like I would respond,
37:36
but in what you said, it's a lot of people,
37:39
but also that Yeah. And not everybody is you. you know, you understand the
37:43
benefit. There's a lot of people that have got jobs and it's just a pain in
37:46
the neck and they don't really want to do it. It's it's and of course there's
37:50
the people you have got those people as well that on the spot they thought great
37:53
idea and then they're highly inefficient and highly effect and they forget
37:58
this. Honestly, I promise you one of the busiest reasons people fail in business
38:01
is the inability to follow up on what they know they should do.
38:06
Simple as that. Just do the simple stuff.
38:10
Yes. And I had another question. Um, do you think internships are useful?
38:14
Because I think in a one way they would be, but on the other hand, I'm learning
38:19
to be an entrepreneur then I'm doing the dirty simple work for businesses online
38:24
most of the times. Oh, is it online?
38:26
A lot of them. And then I feel like it's not really if if you can walk with them
38:30
and actually learn how they do it. But it's probably a lot
38:33
if you can get that that's nice. Then it's useful. But do you think other
38:36
internships like that? Yeah, I think I think with any
38:38
internship you're going to there's slave labor one where you just become a data
38:43
and they're saving money and then there's the one where you actually get
38:46
value. So I think you for me I I I would make sure it's the internship that
38:50
serves you. So I agree with you because the bad one's probably my
38:54
question was really similar because of course we all businesses but we don't
38:59
have any experience like my game plan was mainly just I was trying to get into
39:05
consulting but like
39:09
right now it's impossible because like maybe I can go into sales or
39:15
like that was my just like you know go to sales or go as a
39:18
I mean are you're right I think if you can if you can do something that you
39:22
obviously got to got to earn your time see if you're getting paid right but at
39:25
the end of the day if you can try and plug into the real life experiences go
39:29
in sales going networking sitting in the office listening to the problems
39:32
and I think it's also really hard to mark yourself like there are people who
39:35
have a lot of businesses and stuff but I've just came from high school
39:39
okay so I don't have like that experience I
39:41
can mark myself like a little bit like okay
39:43
you know there's there's another thing that happens by the way and I've seen a
39:46
lot of entrepreneurs never have a job Right. And what what ends up happening
39:52
is they're really bad at things like customer service. They're really bad at
39:55
things like working with people. They're great at ideas, but they have a massive
39:59
gap on how a business runs. And they're the ones that have never had a job. So
40:04
there is an advantage to having a job because you also understand what it's
40:07
like to be employed. Yeah. I've been it's all learning
40:11
manager at a restaurant for two years. Oh, there you go.
40:13
Yeah. So I mostly use that like organ
40:16
organizational uh stuff. Absolutely.
40:19
What I've learned from there 100%. Well, there's a great show in the
40:22
UK, isn't there, called um The Secret Millionaire,
40:25
and he goes back to, you know, pretend to be a guy.
40:30
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And and some of these guys,
40:33
they'll even they they'll say to their kids, you're not going to inherit the
40:36
business until you've worked every single job in the business. You know,
40:40
they start at the bottom and they make them do every job so they understand it.
40:43
That's another level, right? Yeah. No, I mean I think anything's got value if you
40:49
do it. Yeah, but if I was stuck in a room just doing this.
40:53
I feel like 90% of the internships are that and I understand but it's not
40:58
especially when you would want to become entrepreneur then it's not that useful.
41:02
Well, maybe there's an element of that but you can always make sure you're
41:04
you're in an office or you know there's elements of getting out. I think it's a
41:08
very valid question to answer because you don't just want to be a
41:12
you know a cog, right? Yeah.
41:14
Very valid. Very valid. Yeah. In g I went for Dutch companies picked
41:18
in Dutch myself. I can like Okay.
41:21
When I'm back in the Netherlands, I may Oh, okay. Ah, makes a lot of sense.
41:24
Yeah. Yeah.
41:25
Yeah. Good, good, good, mate. Well done. Yeah. Awesome.
41:28
Only unfortunate that I can't put it on the score part because I forgot this
41:31
week. Ah, it's a bummer, mate.
41:33
I I miss the same actually. I got some really like actually because um as I was
41:37
talking to actually I I of course internships were not my main focus
41:41
actually was a company they were just starting. I talk to the CEO and they're
41:45
doing a research into glaucoma and like I take a lot of interest in health.
41:49
Okay. I was not even entering like as in
41:51
management or social media. I was actually paying to do research. Okay.
41:54
I have a bachelor in sport science. Okay.
41:57
They actually paid just waiting for them to answer.
42:01
Nice. I need that.
42:03
Hi gentlemen. Great chat guys there. Thanks a lot.
42:07
Okay everyone. Are we missing anyone?
42:18
Okay. You uh keeping a track of the ones that
42:23
walked out and didn't come back. Yeah. Okay.
42:27
Okay, guys. Hello. Okay. Okay. So, I'm just I'm just going to
42:35
give you five minutes to just try and build your pitch. Okay. So you can think
42:40
of the drop shipping business you're doing now. You could even do a business
42:45
from back home with some people in the last group. They
42:48
did their parents' business. They actually did this for their parents'
42:52
business. Whatever you're going to do, think of the pitch because you're going
42:56
to work on this for five minutes. When you've done this, I'm going to put you
42:59
in groups and you're going to pitch to each other. Okay? Sorry. But the idea of
43:06
doing that pitch, okay, what we're going to do is have the other people in the
43:10
group just say, "I understood completely what you did. It made sense to me and
43:17
it's memorable." That's all it is. Okay? The goal is that when you explain what
43:22
you do, they can clearly understand what you do. And if it's not clear, you'll
43:28
let them know. Okay? We're going to help each other in this. Yes, mate.
43:34
No, no,
43:35
no. Not to build our speech, just
43:40
give us for what's the reason?
43:44
Just to give us No, for this one, for this one, I would
43:49
like you to try and think of it yourselves.
43:51
Okay. No, no, I'd rather think about it
43:55
yourselves. Okay. The the reason the reason No, I I
43:59
understand what you're asking, right? And after you've done this, feel free.
44:02
Okay? I just want you to go through that learning process of working it out for
44:06
yourself and then you can polish it later on.
44:09
Is that okay? Just just for this. Okay. Because you'll see and once you once you
44:13
get this, you understand it'll make more sense.
44:16
Is that okay? Thanks for asking though. Yeah.
44:18
And it will be better to know how to improvise as well.
44:21
Exactly. The trouble is with AI is you know what you want and you get what you
44:24
got. But here is the learning. And if we jump over that, we're not really
44:28
learning anything. Okay. So, give it a go yourself and but
44:32
ask I'm I'm AI here today. Okay.
44:38
I'm going to give you F. Ah, good question. 20 seconds.
44:48
I 20 seconds I'm giving you. You can do it.
44:55
By the way, do you know why I'm asking for 20 seconds?
45:01
Hey guys, do you know why I'm asking for 20 seconds?
45:07
Okay, I I'd listen to this if I was you guys. If you don't want to listen, 20
45:12
seconds, people lose attention. They're already going. Okay, so by the
45:18
way, do it for aim for 20. Okay, if today you run over a little bit, it's
45:24
okay. Okay, but here's the thing. When you're at a networking event and they
45:28
say you've got 30 seconds, they mean 30 seconds because if you're still talking,
45:34
they'll have a buzzer and I go, "Stop. Move on."
45:38
And if you can't do it, half your message is missed. Okay? But for today,
45:43
just do the best you can around 20 seconds. Okay? I'm not going to shoot
45:47
anyone. Your classmates in a group, in a small
45:52
group. Okay. So for Yeah. So for today, you can
46:01
you can still do this, right? You can still do this if you want.
46:07
Yeah. Or if you want to just pitch it to your ideal consumers, you can do that.
46:11
That's your choice as well. Okay. Develop a pitch. So now what I
46:16
would do is I keep my pitches on my phone. So I have three or four for
46:22
different services. And then if someone says you need to present, Phil, I can go
46:26
that one and go. I'm lucky I can also think it up
46:31
on the spot. But at least you could have a couple
46:34
that you're ready with. Okay, so you got five minutes to look at that. Any
46:37
questions, let me know. But here's some good ways to start.
46:43
Statistics about your business. What I will let you do is if you need
46:48
statistics about your business, I'll let you go online for statistics.
46:52
Okay? Does that help? If you need statistics, feel free to do that. Okay,
46:56
so you just got five minutes to look at that.
47:01
Okay, understand
47:05
staring at me. I'm like, have I done something wrong? You okay?
47:08
All right, you can use your if you want to make
47:12
notes, feel free, right? You guys okay? Oh, you're done.
47:20
Oh, well done. You're already there, man.
47:29
Yeah. If you make it up for today, 110% of statistics are made up.
47:36
You okay, guys? I just one small question is about the
47:42
the drop shipping company or the product or about us. This you're trying to
47:48
explain the drop shipping business to someone who might buy from you.
47:53
This is just one product. We explain the product.
47:55
Yeah. One product. So you got lots of products. Explain one.
48:00
Yeah. It's just being able to formulate this. So what's one product?
48:04
Recorders. Record players.
48:07
Okay. So imagine you're presenting what you do to a group of people,
48:12
right? And that's the product you're going to sell to that group of people.
48:15
What group of people do you want to use as an example?
48:20
Students, you can use the students as an example
48:22
or you could say to them, okay, for this example, you're a group of 50 year old
48:27
men. It's like Bluetooth.
48:31
Oh, Bluetooth. Yeah.
48:33
Okay, cool. Just choose. But don't do the same one, eh? Do a different one
48:37
each because you're going to bounce off each
48:39
other and say, "Was it clear? Do I understand?" That's what you're looking
48:43
for. Okay. Thanks for asking.
48:50
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me.
48:59
Yeah. Good question. Okay.
49:13
Who you talking to? Students
49:15
to this class, right? Okay. You're going to have to split us up and
49:19
put us in two different groups. We're both going to have the same picture.
49:22
Okay. Yeah, I'll let you split yourselves. Yeah,
49:24
we both run Well, you both got two pictures, but you
49:26
can go in here talk to people. All right. Okay.
49:38
because I thought you maybe you were selling a a system of getting people
49:41
together. That is our goal. That's our mission to
49:44
bring all the university students together and because a lot of kids from
49:48
18 to 21, they can't go to clubs. No, absolutely not.
49:51
Plus, this is 18 plus. So, you're talking to a group. Yeah. So,
49:57
I mean, yeah, it depends who you're talking to again, but if you're talking
50:00
to the students, Yeah. Have you ever found that you want to go out at night,
50:03
but you can't because you're too young or whatever? Um
50:08
yeah, if you go to the other parties in there being shut down because it's
50:12
illegal not allowed to have parties or this is legal, this is
50:18
but you can build that in. Yeah, that's nice.
50:22
But again, you see, so you might have one or two of these because remember
50:25
some networking groups you go back to a couple of times. So each time you might
50:28
just hit on a different point and what you do is slowly chip away. This is
50:31
basically a great warm up for us at 8 p.m. At 800 p.m. we have a video
50:38
coming different.
50:41
Oh, brilliant. Well, there you go. So, this is a warm up.
50:43
So, you're doing one, he's doing a different one. So,
50:46
we both run the business. This can be when we start.
50:50
That's what I'm saying. We have to we have to film.
50:52
Yeah. So, I'm going to change my question.
50:53
Yeah. So, imagine So, all I know I have, right? Yeah. Now, imagine that you know
50:58
exactly where to be, exactly who you're going to be with. It's safe. It's
51:01
secure. It's not gonna get closed down. Um, and you can do it at the press of a
51:05
button. That's what we do. Bang. Yeah. Nice one, mate. Nice. Well
51:09
done. We got accommod
51:13
from the student accommodation there and back party.
51:16
No. Oh, beautiful. So, what you want to do is paint the scenario and you say all
51:20
you have to do basically is sign up and turn up.
51:24
I'm wishing this was a whole entire cohort thing so I could get up on the
51:28
stage and auditori. Yeah, we should do that. You can pitch
51:30
to all 200. You could do a video and send it out on
51:34
video through your WhatsApp chat. All right. So, what I would do is let's
51:47
say is a scenario. You say, "Have you ever?" So, the questions, hands up if
51:52
you've ever had your plumbing in your house go wrong.
51:56
Right. Um, and you need the plumber right now.
51:59
But when you search on Google, you can't find one. They're always delayed. Right.
52:02
So, paint that jazz. Everybody's had that and then carry on.
52:11
Ah, yes. Yeah. So, paint the scenario of have you ever have you ever had a
52:16
plumbing issue in your house and it's a real mess and when you've tried to get
52:20
hold of the plumber, you can't and so it continues to get wet.
52:24
Continue. My name's Nesh. What I've done is I've developed an AI that will
52:26
respond immediately and we'll have someone around your house in
52:31
you with me? Yeah. Well done, mate. You're nearly
52:33
there. Yeah. You're just taking it from have
52:39
you ever you're asking them to share an experience. Most people have always had
52:42
that. You okay?
52:46
Cool. Sorry guys. I'm just going to step over your feet. Thanks.
52:52
How you doing? I actually already have a page.
52:57
Okay. And I just like modified it a little.
53:03
Yes. Okay. I'm If you're a content creator,
53:07
is anyone helping you scale your short content? I run a clipping agency that
53:11
transform content into viral clips and shares them across all social media
53:16
platforms. It's helping creators generate millions
53:19
of organic views and sales. So, what you've done is good. What
53:23
you've done is go into the the one I said which is don't do which is hay I'm
53:26
da I'm a country right you gone straight back into old
53:31
style yeah well I usually start is with
53:34
straight up is anyone helping you with okay so instead of that what's the pain
53:39
they're having probably having to pay a lot for ads
53:45
okay so do you ever feel that you're paying more for ads than you get so you
53:50
don't feel you're paying lots of money for your ads but you're not getting the
53:54
Okay. Most people I promise you in business
53:56
they will complain about how much they're spending and the results they're
53:59
not getting. Okay.
54:01
So, so what you if you're speaking to a group, hands up. If you're currently
54:05
investing on social media ads and you're not getting the results you want right
54:10
now, you've got me. My name's D. All right. Because you've woken me up.
54:17
If you start with, "Hi, I'm Dan." That's what everybody else did. And they're
54:21
like, "Oh, here we go again. You with me?"
54:24
It's almost like you need to go wake up. Okay.
54:27
You with me? Yeah.
54:28
All right. Any questions? Are we all good?
54:38
All nailed. Sweet.
54:41
Yes, mate. investors or people,
54:49
you tell me who you're speaking to. So, if you're standing there in front of
54:53
investors, then it's an investor pitch. If you're
54:57
going to a networking event with small business owners, then it's not an
55:01
It depends what you're trying to get from this.
55:05
You could have a couple of different ones.
55:07
I just want you to give me one today. Yeah.
55:10
Yes, mate. Would you say it's better to ask a question in the pitch?
55:15
Ask what a question because I want to start like with the
55:18
imagin but would you say also better to put
55:22
that question? Okay. What's the question?
55:25
I mean for example am I right to assume that you all want to make more
55:31
kind of like that type of question. So for people to be active or I can just
55:37
put imagine to make them. Yeah, I mean you can do that. You can also put your
55:41
hands up if you'd like to earn more money.
55:44
So what you do by doing that is again you're doing something different to what
55:47
everybody else do. How could I put it on the pitch?
55:52
Well, okay. So, so a lot of people won't put their hand up because they won't
55:56
admit they're not making as much as they want.
55:58
Yeah. So, what you could put your hand up if
56:01
you're earning good revenue, but you'd like to earn even more.
56:05
Okay. So, no one's embarrassed then. Yeah.
56:07
You with me? All right. But the physical act of putting their hand up gets them
56:11
to listen to you. Okay. See, what you're fighting against
56:14
is all the other boring people before you.
56:20
Good. You done, man? Yeah.
56:25
I did it for my own business. Okay. Cool.
56:29
AIT and AI automation.
56:33
Okay. I also do this when I'm on. Do you know
56:38
that? Do you know that even in the age of AI
56:43
business owners are not really free? They're stuck with their own businesses
56:47
and doing the heavy work that they are not supposed to do.
56:50
So I hey use this AI perceptionist that we have built from scratch to make you
56:56
free from your visits and doing all the monkey work that's supposed to be done
57:00
not by you but giving you the freedom that you wanted.
57:06
Okay. I love it. Yeah. Even in the age of AI most people are still doing the
57:10
donkey work. Yeah. Because they don't know how to use
57:13
it. Yeah. Lovely. Nice. Well done. That's why I used I still use my
57:20
you you said an important word in there by the way which was interesting which
57:23
was freedom. So did can you believe that even in the
57:26
age of AI 97% of businesses business owners are still slaves to their
57:32
business doing stuff they shouldn't be doing my business and I give I'm g
57:36
freedom by giving them nice well done
57:45
it could be freedom and more revenue yes mid
57:51
I only have one slide like the Sorry, I'm not with you.
57:57
Apart from the slides, before you leave the regular,
58:02
you don't have this one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
58:11
Okay. Are we all good? Everybody nearly there. I've seen some
58:15
good ones, eh? Okay. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to let you have a quick
58:19
stretch. Okay. I'm going to give you a quick five minutes. Stretch. Move.
58:23
Bathroom. TV, radio, run up and down the street, go to Aman, go to Okay, you got
58:30
five minutes. Okay, we haven't had a break, have we? Yes, we had a break,
58:33
don't we? We had a break.
58:35
So, we're not having a break. No,
58:38
did we have a break? We did have a break, don't we? Yeah, I've gone mental.
58:41
Sorry, I've gone mad. Okay, here we go. Ready? So, I'm going
58:44
to break you into groups. Sorry. I have gone. It's an old thing. You'll get it
58:47
one day. Okay. So, I'm going to put you into little groups. You two need to
58:50
break up. So, we put it to the whole clock. No,
58:52
no. You're just going to pitch to a little group. So, what I want is put
58:55
yourselves in groups of four. Ideally, somebody in a different selling a
59:00
different product. Teams of four. Now, this is what's going to happen in in
59:04
turn. You're going to pitch at the other three people.
59:09
Okay? Your goal is that they understand what you do.
59:15
Okay? So, the other three are going to give you feedback,
59:20
right? The feedback loop. Does anyone know how to give a good feedback? A
59:25
feedback loop. Ah, another secret. Okay. So, um, so what you do is say what I
59:35
liked was bum bum bum bum.
59:40
And what would make
59:45
it even better
59:51
for me is b okay this is what's called feedback
59:58
right feedback loop the the interesting thing a lot of people don't like giving
1:00:03
feedback because they feel like they're not being nice and they might upset them
1:00:07
okay if you look at the way this is done this is positive positive. So what it
1:00:12
says is what I liked was the structure.
1:00:17
What would make it even better for me is if you did this.
1:00:22
Okay, the most important word there is even better. So there's nothing
1:00:27
negative. It was good and it could be even better. Do you understand? It's a
1:00:32
really nice way to give feedback. Okay. So in your fours, take any four. We're
1:00:37
going to give you five minutes each. Okay? five minutes each person and
1:00:40
you're going to give feedback. So, let's move.
1:00:46
You guys in the same business? Different business.
1:00:48
Okay. Okay. Time's going. Time's going.
1:01:09
Can Excuse me.
1:01:10
Can we do five? Yeah, you just got to be quick, right?
1:01:15

1:01:33

1:07:54
Oh my days. Last one, right?
1:07:58
Huh? Like we all similar like
1:08:02
I want different approach. It's much more like
1:08:08
cuz I want to like people. Hello. I am an entrepreneur and I have
1:08:14
multiple successes and I will tell you right now if you if you feel
1:08:18
uncomfortable or you think I'm a professional because the way I yell,
1:08:20
you're not ready to work with me in a market that will eat you alive. I have a
1:08:25
startup right now, I will guarantee you within one year, you will become a
1:08:28
millionaire. If you don't think I'm professional by yelling, I don't want
1:08:31
you to contact me. However, if you're ready for the market that I drive, have
1:08:35
a talk with me later. Let's chat like those vibes,
1:08:38
okay? It might work with some people. Yeah.
1:08:45
Yeah. I tell I think you you're on to
1:08:47
something. Definitely cuz it's different.
1:08:51
But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I I combine that and maybe soften it a little bit.
1:08:55
But I like where you're coming from. Yeah. I have to like drain like as in
1:08:59
like strain the people that are like I like I met a lot of like professional
1:09:03
people that will like really quick cuz I'm young like oh you have a business
1:09:08
like let me like be your dad. So I want to like straighten those people out and
1:09:11
just work with like people that are like ready and I work day and night as like
1:09:16
very hard. I want people that are as smart as you need to work.
1:09:20
Yeah. I like it. And particularly then you go networking in places where you
1:09:22
get more of them. Right. Exactly. And I feel like I just wonder
1:09:26
you didn't mention what you did, but you you got somebody interested, right?
1:09:29
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. They're going to be like, "Why are you
1:09:31
doing what's up?" You know what I'm saying? That's my
1:09:34
point. Yeah. Okay.
1:09:35
Well, you're certainly memorable. You're certainly memorable, right?
1:09:39
I remember this one tomorrow. You're going to be like the guy that
1:09:41
if I if I see you, I'm going to be going that way, man.
1:09:55
You're done though. Yeah. Everyone done?
1:09:59
Finish. Okay, we're going to come back in.
1:10:04
Okay. Okay, everybody.
1:10:07
You guys done? Done.
1:10:10
Yeah. Okay.
1:10:13
Okay. Well done. Okay. So just quickly,
1:10:20
hey guys, just quickly, is there anyone in your
1:10:23
group you'd like to acknowledge because you thought they did a really fantastic
1:10:26
job? Who is that?
1:10:29
Genuinely very interested in like away from the whole pitch itself.
1:10:38
So that's awesome. Great job. Anyone else?
1:10:44
in our team. This guy made it was incredible. Like started yelling at it
1:10:51
was different. He's going to find the 1% he can work
1:10:53
with, I'm sure. Okay. All right, guys. Well done.
1:10:58
Anyway, I hope that helps you a little bit with pitching to a group.
1:11:01
Okay. When you're talking to somebody one-on-one, you can still kind of use
1:11:06
the same philosophy, right? Yeah. Maybe not that one.
1:11:12
Okay, just stay with me, guys. So, when when we're go, gentlemen,
1:11:17
sorry, guys, just for time. Um, when you're working oneon-one, you might have
1:11:22
to refine it a little bit, but you can still use these. Yeah, you can still
1:11:27
bear this in mind. Okay. And this one, you can still bear this in mind and go.
1:11:32
And of course, you'll know which way to take your pitch
1:11:37
as soon as you understand what they do. So, if you're at an event and I've met
1:11:43
you, I don't know what to pitch until I know something about you. So, when
1:11:48
you're oneon-one, you can be super targeted, but I need him to talk f
1:11:53
excuse me, I need him to talk first so I know what to say. Does that make sense?
1:11:59
So, what I can do is say, "Look, can you just tell me a little bit more about
1:12:03
yourself so I know how to explain what I do?" Once I know about you, then you can
1:12:08
change your pitch. So he goes, I understand. I understand. I understand.
1:12:12
Make sense? Okay. So, a couple of other things you
1:12:17
can use um is this one. You can also when people say, "What do
1:12:22
you do?" You can Yeah, you can switch over in a second. Um I help people.
1:12:28
Okay. So, what what might you help people do? What's the pain?
1:12:33
Okay. What's the pain you help people with?
1:12:38
Someone says, "What do you do?" You say, "Well, I help people this." You can just
1:12:41
do it in one phrase. What What pain do you help people with?
1:12:44
What pain do you help them with? Huh?
1:12:49
They want money. So, how would you make this? I help
1:12:54
people build money, build their businesses.
1:12:57
Okay. Can you be a little bit more hook than that?
1:13:00
Like, what do you mean? So, hook is how do you help people based
1:13:03
on the pain? I help you with your business. We both
1:13:06
become successful couple. I help people grow their business and be
1:13:11
successful with me. Yes.
1:13:13
Something like Okay. What you want? What you want them to do here is go, "Sorry,
1:13:17
you do what? I don't know what it is you do, but I'm interested." Okay. So, this
1:13:21
can be a little bit confusing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I used to have a guy
1:13:29
who said, "I help people think outside of the bottle.
1:13:36
What you you help people think. Sorry. Say it
1:13:39
again. Got him interested. Oh, I do water filtration.
1:13:43
Do you mean but he's got your interest, right? You know, all the a lot of the
1:13:47
water in Dubai comes from these plastic containers that's left out in the sun.
1:13:50
So, it might have plastic in it. So, he did water filtration to make sure it's
1:13:54
clean. Okay. It's a thought. But he starts the
1:13:57
conversation by saying, "I help people think outside the bottle." And you say,
1:14:01
"Sorry, you do what?" Now you got a conversation. Make sense?
1:14:07
Okay. The other way you can describe what you do one-on-one is to is to
1:14:11
explain a scenario. Okay. So, um, who's got a business here
