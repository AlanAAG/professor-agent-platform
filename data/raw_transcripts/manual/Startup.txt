Dr. Raihan Taqui Syed
0:00
Confident speech class that reminds me tomorrow you have an event.
0:05
Am I right? Yes.
0:06
Pitch to real founders one opportunity. You have it what they had it. So make
0:14
your pitch make your presentation as convincing as possible in the first go.
0:20
Life hardly gives you a second chance. That is why you're preparing. The whole
0:23
idea of this course is to see to that you all know this nonsense but we are
0:28
recapping it to make you all confident and competent that one opportunity you
0:34
never know it may come in Dubai in India in Singapore I know your list of
0:38
countries you all travel somewhere sometime some person might believe in
0:42
your idea and that is what we should be prepared as it is said opposite
0:47
opportunities dance only with people who are on the dance floor first of all
0:51
become competent to be on the dance Mhm. Opportunities definitely will dance with
0:56
you. One last one last learning that 80% of that you
1:00
have one learning. Very good. The CEO he had a vision and
1:06
that even the engineers didn't believe in but he just pushed through it and
1:12
then the engineers in the end were able to do it.
1:15
The business part of it. Yeah. Business.
1:17
Okay. But then it became just too much. It became unethical after a certain
1:22
point. That is when the whole company started collapsing. Okay class those who
1:27
did not I know you're busy super busy spare how many minutes is a full movie?
1:34
140 class
1:37
please spare that time from your busy schedule before we meet next week. I
1:41
want all of you to watch because most of it is covered in the units what we
1:45
discuss. We talk about opportunity today. uh cooking dinner
1:51
class you watch it sleeping cooking dinner eating I don't care wherever you
1:55
are however you are do this small interesting homework watch the movie
2:01
what we cover theoretically is practically reflected okay can I have

2:40
the pronunciation. Okay. Which language? Okay. Nishika. That's that's easy. Okay.
2:48
Aren fine class. Yes.
2:51
So we know the design thinking process. We know the why. We know why we are
2:56
starting. What is the process? Let's get back to the process itself. The first
3:01
part of the process is opportunity. Here not every idea is a business
3:08
opportunity. Do you all get ideas?
3:13
Where and when? Mostly. When there's a lot of
3:20
one by one shower when there's a lot of input
3:23
sorry when there's a lot of input
3:24
lot of input so I need to keep bombarding you with inputs you get
3:27
lovely ideas even when talking to someone I get the idea I
3:31
don't know why when talking to someone
3:33
while watching watching
3:36
reals okay social media cooking
3:39
cooking while sleeping
3:41
while sleeping or before sleeping no dreaming and thinking is different
3:46
before sleeping Sometimes your dreams can become ideas.
3:49
Yes. So that's dreams. Talking about ideas. You think that is not you
3:54
thinking. While facing a particular problem.
3:56
While facing a problem. While walking.
3:58
While walking. Class. Can you give an example please?
4:02
Any example? You got an idea and that was a brilliant idea in your personal or
4:06
professional lives. Not business idea. Not implement.
4:12
Sorry. Implement.
4:13
No no no. Just idea. I'll teach you implementation today.
4:21
uh let us respect the boundaries. I don't want those wild ideas which are
4:25
beyond the ethics of this institution and country. Okay, let us have some
4:30
boundaries. Okay, so it was about social media. You
4:33
got an idea for Tik Tok and it got viral for 1 million views.
4:37
Okay, that's what I put Nutella on pizza also.
4:41
Okay, you you did that. You implemented that.
4:44
Did you have it? Yeah, it was. And how was it?
4:47
Very good. That okay. Yes, Lucia.
4:49
Well, doing my nails, I was using these little glitter things and then I thought
4:53
of a video that I could do with those little glitter things, but then I did it
4:56
and it was my only viral video. I was like, "Oh, that's great."
4:59
Okay. Anybody else class others don't get ideas?
5:05
I I work in fashion, so there's a lot of people who dress really nice and you can
5:09
see a lot from them. And I implemented a few in few.
5:13
Okay. class. Did you realize your either reflection or experiences or observation
5:19
are coming in handy like why do we talk about walking shower and before sleeping
5:25
you are alone that is a reflection time when you're talking to somebody
5:29
discussion time when you're observing somebody you are learning or just your
5:33
own action you're reflectioning upon opportunity is a favorable set of
5:38
circumstances every idea class ideas are diamond dozen
5:43
Every morning we get ideas. Every night we get ideas. Not every idea is a
5:49
business opportunity. Business opportunity requires
5:53
that idea to be transferable to a product, a service or a full-fledged
5:59
business. Let's have a look at one video which
6:04
summarizes this discussion. Imagine
6:30
being able to build an app with your name on it just by thinking about it.
6:34
Meet base 44, a complete. In the previous video, we introduced you to the
6:39
seven ways to find great startup ideas. And in this one we will focus
6:46
really interesting because this company that I
6:52
the guy build the guy that build this company they build like solo founder for
6:56
six months owned by and sell the ins $18 million
7:04
that's recording in progress
7:10
like the seventh month that he hired One more guy. So you do like $18 million in
7:16
six months alone like just for the wave in the market.
7:21
Fine. That's like that's exactly what our discussion for
7:25
today is how are different opportunities categorized and what should you
7:30
capitalize upon. Let's have a look one example then you go back to the theory
7:35
connect the categorization and wind up for today on how to find smaller scale
7:41
less risky business ideas which take advantage of the new trends generated by
7:45
those innovative startups but just to be clear this video is not about how to
7:50
evaluate those ideas. They might be good or bad but that's another topic. This
7:56
video is really about how to come up with those ideas to start with. So you
8:00
can do that by asking a few brainstorming questions about a new
8:04
market, a new trend that is currently growing. When this happens, it opens up
8:09
a lot of opportunities to start businesses. Let's take a few examples to
8:14
illustrate that and give you some inspirational material. So let's say
8:18
that drones happen. Drones are great and they opened up a whole new market of
8:24
these new devices which can do many interesting things. Now ask yourself,
8:29
can you create drones, meaning manufacture them? Well, this is more
8:34
like a high-risk capitalintensive startup idea. You could do it
8:38
technically, but it's very complicated to become a drone manufacturer from
8:42
scratch. So then ask yourself, what else can you do with drones? Do drones
8:48
produce something that you can sell? Well, for a big part, drones produce
8:52
videos and images from angles and heights that were previously accessible
8:56
only by helicopters. So, obviously, many people bought their own drones and
9:01
started to sell photo and video footage like a photography service. There are
9:06
companies specialized in doing real estate drone photography, golf course
9:11
drone photography, etc., etc. Others purchase drones and are helping
9:15
businesses do visual inspections of things that are difficult to access like
9:20
high alitude power lines, factories, and so on. So, think about what can you do
9:25
with this new product that recently appeared on the market. Now, what about
9:30
all the people who casually create drone images and videos from the sky? Some of
9:35
them do it for fun, others do it for specific projects. But what if you could
9:40
create a marketplace where people could sell these images and videos just like
9:44
all the marketplaces for traditional photography? Because aerial footage is
9:48
very valuable. So obviously some entrepreneurs already invested in that
9:52
area as well like this website. It just makes sense. A marketplace for something
9:58
that drones produce. The next question you can ask yourself is, is it something
10:03
you can rent? Can you make a business renting drones? For example,
10:09
one example of drone. First of all, can you manufacture? Maybe put up a factory
10:14
here in Dubai or in Asal Khima. Do you have the capital? Do you have the
10:18
expertise, resources? No. Can you do something with the drones or do you have
10:24
the capacity to buy and rent out the drones? So, step by step, we are
10:29
creating business ideas which are business opportunities.
10:35
Well, you probably can because drones are expensive and there might be a
10:38
market of people who very rarely need to use a drone but don't need to buy one.
10:43
There's a German company called Grower which rents all kinds of innovative
10:47
technological devices. And these kinds of businesses are very local. Think
10:52
about it. It's really tough to rent something that you need to ship far
10:55
away. So, if there's no such company in your local market, that might be
10:59
something you could consider doing. Next question you can explore is can you
11:04
create services around that new product. When it comes to drones, there are drone
11:09
repairing companies for example and there are also drone pilot schools which
11:13
you pay to learn how to fly them. And finally another question you can ask is
11:18
can you create a community or content around that trend?
11:25
Look how the categorization this will help in your drop shipping
11:29
business project you have and all the discussions you know the cahoot quiz it
11:34
is graded so please pay attention let us study in the class I don't want you all
11:37
to go back home and study the material my course we do it in the class whatever
11:42
you do homework is mostly movies I'll tell you that for the next class now
11:46
okay first as a product can you manufacture it
11:52
if yes Maybe you have a million dollar you know
11:56
uh investment with you. So then can you use the product? Maybe yes.
12:05
Third, can you buy few and rent them out? Look what we can do with a product
12:12
one idea drone. Either manufacture one or rent out them or use them for your
12:20
business as a raw material. Fourth, can you create services? So
12:29
maybe you buy one, you use it for a service. It could be
12:35
maybe plus I don't know how many of you are aware the wedding photography today.
12:41
So maybe you tie up with the event management company. Wedding photography
12:45
gone are those days. I don't know how many of you remember weddings. Wherever
12:48
you come from, I have attended weddings in different countries. class one one
12:53
honest you know uh suggestion you go to different countries from this semester
12:57
onwards try your best to attend weddings locally
13:01
that's the best experience to understand culture like you are here I don't know
13:05
how you can network how you can get to know people in India in Singapore
13:10
experience the weddings weddings are a reflection of the culture and it's
13:15
interesting to learn about cultures so back here gola sorry
13:19
of I have been a student for a long long
13:23
time. Trust me, nothing better than free food. Free good food. Okay, free food is
13:28
different. Free good food. As a student, it is a blessing. So, back here class,
13:33
no longer we have all these wires, one person carrying that huge camera, three
13:38
people carrying the wire. As a child growing up, I never had one wedding in
13:43
my family and friend circle where one aunt or uncle did not trip and fall. And
13:48
how severe they fall, the bigger the drama.
13:51
Family itself is a drama. Wedding is a bigger drama. A mishap in a wedding,
13:56
even bigger drama. All that is replaced by one drone.
14:00
That's it. One person, one drone and laptop, the whole wedding is shot. So
14:04
here, look how one particular business idea. Finally, forget about everything.
14:10
Just content creation, nothing. You are using the drone to create
14:18
content. Plus in the process of content creation,
14:21
where is the product or who is the product?
14:31
So, correct. So, when you create content,
14:38
okay, the content itself is a product, right? You're creating it
14:43
and you are the content creator. You're the product creator. Look, one drone,
14:48
multiple business opportunities where you can use it as a product, where
14:55
you can use it for a service, rental service, content creation service, email
15:01
management service. Look, one particular product can help you in so many ways as
15:07
a business, not only as a user. Let us have a look at the next particular
15:11
example. There are websites and YouTube channels dedicated to drones. They cover
15:16
drone news, talk about drones, and they make money out of it. Now, I guess you
15:21
better understand what I'm talking about. Any new trend creates a new
15:25
market. And there are many smaller scale businesses that can be created within
15:29
that market. If you redo this question tree for virtual reality headsets or
15:34
hoverboards, for example, you'll see that there are decent business ideas
15:38
answering most of these questions just the same way. Now, you probably noticed
15:42
that I talked mainly about physical products. But what about startups that
15:47
create or expand new markets like Airbnb, Uber, and others, but which
15:52
don't create new physical products? Well, they are also trends and there are
15:56
businesses to be created around them as well. Let's take a look at Airbnb. So,
16:01
Airbnb is growing users.
16:06
Almost all of you, those who have not, don't worry. It's it's a service. You
16:11
can use that platform to book a room, to book a house, to book a villa.
16:17
The choice is more. That's it. Like booking.com that offers you and then the
16:24
difference is it can be as small as a room within a house
16:28
and that is what is required whether are students or travelers. We use the space
16:33
only to sleep. We are out the whole day. if you are working or we are visiting
16:37
the uh tourist sites. So this is an example of how opportunities can be
16:44
found around the world. And here's a list of businesses that tap into the
16:48
market around it by creating additional services which increase the experience
16:52
for the homeowners. There are concier services, cleaning services, and host
16:57
services. So there are definitely many services that you can create around it.
17:02
But now let's get on a smaller scale. Is there something you could sell or rent
17:06
when it comes to Airbnb? Well, obviously that's where there are more and more
17:10
people making investments in real estate properties and taking advantage of the
17:14
growing demand for these units. So, if you live in a touristic area where
17:18
Airbnb is popular, you can buy an investment property and make good money
17:22
out of it if your city doesn't forbid that. Of course,
17:28
now I don't know whether you're observing that season is starting
17:31
October 1st to March 30th. six months where Dubai makes the most money because
17:37
weather becomes better and I have my own friends who don't rent out to families
17:41
or to other people on a monthly basis. They use a agent agent charges 10%. only
17:49
to manage Airbnb calendar. Are you getting the
17:53
plus real estate one product agency complementing the business one
17:59
more business because for example I don't have time to manage my property I
18:03
will tell him he has a agency in Dubai which does this for multiple people
18:09
managing the calendars he takes 10% commission out of it like Talabad for
18:15
managing the bookings he's responsible I have no headache I make money. He makes
18:21
money. Real estate developers make money. Everybody's making money out of
18:25
one business. This is one particular example. Or you could create a real
18:30
estate renting agency and work fully with Airbnb. That's because usually
18:35
existing businesses are reluctant to change and most will wait a long time
18:39
before jumping on the bandwagon of some new trend. So that gives time to
18:43
newcomers to do a better job and take their places. And finally, you can also
18:48
create content around Airbnb. Once again, talk about Airbnb, train people
18:53
how to be good at renting stuff like this. Content like websites and YouTube
18:58
videos is really at the end of the value chain of a new market. It's relatively
19:02
easy to do, although it doesn't necessarily generate a lot of money. But
19:06
there are always several businesses which start early and become the leaders
19:10
of that specific content niche. They become the reference. They are the best
19:15
ranked. People turn to them when they want to learn about that new trend. So
19:20
if you're one of the first at that or if you do it better than the others, you
19:24
could become the leading content source about that new market, that new product,
19:28
and make a business out of it. And if you follow Airbnb closely, you will
19:32
notice that they launched a thing called experiences. People create and sell
19:37
experiences to travelers like tour guides or travel agencies. It can be any
19:42
kind of experience as long as it's interesting. So do you see where I'm
19:46
getting with this? experience of experience.
19:53
Anybody here in the class have you used Airbnb?
19:58
Have you not used the experience part of it?
20:01
There's more and more there's even like people can come to your house to give
20:05
you a massage and cut your hair all those things. So here apart from
20:11
that you are creating an experience for stay apart from just stay experience and
20:17
then you upload that and maybe you become viral become popular you start
20:21
charging just for capturing the experience.
20:26
So others know about it, others pay for the Airbnb but they are actually paying
20:32
because experience is quite catchy and maybe impressive compared to other hotel
20:38
booking or a hostel booking. Is the point clear here?
20:47
Yes. Apart from that just staying. So just to give an example I have two
20:58
students in Alen part of Abu Dhabi emirate. I have invested in their
21:02
startup. Their startup is converting their farm. They have date farm family
21:07
business date farms into experiential stay.
21:11
They have now built studio so people can come and stay. One, experience the date
21:19
farming process. Experience date syrup making process. Have a local Emirati
21:26
lunch followed by dinner and a wrap-up. One full day stay plus experiences.
21:36
Plus, this is this is inspired by I don't know how many of you have been to
21:40
Europe or many of you are from Europe. I've been to strawberry farms in Spain.
21:44
cheese cheese uh you know making factories
21:49
2030 I remember that time so this exactly is experience
21:58
of course of course all that is part of it
22:01
so here back in this particular topic is you are not only providing stay but also
22:07
experiential stay that could be as simple as a haircut
22:14
which is quite common and global or it could be focused on that particular area
22:20
dates, olives, strawberries, cheese, all that would be fine. Are we clear?
22:27
Very soon some of the best experiences for travelers will be found and sold on
22:32
Airbnb and you could do that. You could create multiple ones and make a business
22:37
out of it. for example, this experiences will for sure take some market share
22:42
from the traditional tour guides and local travel agencies. So, you could be
22:46
the one taking some of it. So, when you notice that Airbnb launches experiences
22:51
and if you ask yourself the list of questions in this video, you'll stop at
22:55
the very basic one. Is it something you can sell? Well, yes, definitely.
23:00
Whenever there is a new trend, a new market, or a new something, just think
23:04
about all the opportunities that open up along with it. Is there something you
23:08
can sell? Is there something you can rent? Does it produce something you
23:12
could sell or rent? Is it something you can extensively and regularly talk about
23:17
or create a community around? Can you create a physical space around it like
23:21
an entertainment area, etc., etc. I hope that this video gives you some
23:26
inspiration about how to find new business ideas which are less risky than
23:30
high growth capital inensive startups. If you're interested to learn more,
23:37
back to the slides here. So what are the essential qualities? How
23:44
do you define a opportunity is good or not? First and foremost class in today's
23:49
world of you know content it should be attractive. Let us be honest. It should
23:54
be appealing. It should look nice. So I visited their farm. The first thing
24:00
was make it more attractive. Farm to grow trees and farm to attract tourists.
24:06
Require two different mindsets. I would like to go and stay in a farm which is
24:10
beautiful. Let us be honest. As a visitor, as a farmer, I don't care about
24:16
looks. I care about yield. But now you are converting that into an experiential
24:21
stay for people who are not even from this country or region or not even the
24:25
continent. First attractive. Uh I know enough of cliched quotes.
24:32
Looks don't matter. Personality matters. All nonsense.
24:37
Ask our fashion guru here. Okay. Fashion industry is a billiond dollar industry.
24:42
Looks matter. Class looks not surfacial. Looks appealing
24:48
whether as a person, as a property, as a business or as a product or service.
24:52
Looks looks nice. Imagine this to be a shabby rectangle boring thing. No, it is
25:00
based on economics. How you hold? So the fingers here looks matter.
25:08
You agree or not? Accept it. Looks ultimately design is part of the
25:13
looks. Right. Correct. So please spend some time. Is it attractive? Next
25:20
class. Be the person at the right time. Timing matters.
25:28
Enough of companies closed down in COVID. enough of companies made millions
25:33
of dollars during co the timing was apt you have to have the right product at
25:39
the right time one example because we believe in
25:45
learning from examples I'll give an example then I want you people to talk
25:49
my my school friend sorry mask mask
25:54
mask okay mask is common mask and sanitizer was the common product for 3
25:59
years but then there was my friend back in India. My school friend, she
26:04
graduated one year junior to me. She was working then she joined her family
26:08
business which was producing moisturizers and aromatic oils. Those
26:12
who use those use for your skin and aromatic oils specific you know
26:18
fragrances sandalwood is common. So
26:23
this was this factory was based in Mysurer. So sandalwood fragrance
26:27
moisturizers and aromatic oils exported to different countries. Grandfather
26:31
started, father continued, daughter joined. Good business running very well.
26:35
COVID happened and we all know we all were affected
26:39
and co none of us went out of our beds, forget our houses.
26:44
People finished their degrees on the bed,
26:47
zoom call on and you're just sleeping. Okay.
26:51
So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good old days early. So back here now the problem was
26:58
business is cut down, supply chain is cut down, consumers don't care about
27:02
aromatic oils because they are worried about life and death. Now
27:07
what would you do? Make it
27:12
to your okay medicinal value because people were
27:16
suffering people were suff so many variants of COVID plus we all got CO.
27:23
Yeah. with variance all of us. It could be a
27:28
common cold, it could be cough, it could be you know throat pain but we were
27:31
affected directly or indirectly that virus to great extent has taken lives. I
27:37
have been a you know witness of those uh not so good moments sad moments but back
27:42
here the timing the two options for the timing what do you think she would have
27:48
done or she should have done closing the factory was one option but
27:54
then it affects livelihood of thousands of people like hundreds employees
27:59
thousands of people so how do you continue
28:06
3 months are already in.
28:10
Okay, they're already in the moisturizer and this one. Plus, do you remember a
28:14
sanitizer? Anybody has a bottle now? My bottle here.
28:18
Bottle of sanitizer. The that tall one.
28:25
Okay. Class. Ah, yeah. This the green bottle. Okay.
28:28
The fragrance. So what they did was they had the
28:32
capacity, they had the factory, they just had to change, make slight
28:37
modifications instead of aromatic oils, make aromatic sanitizers and they
28:43
already had an existing customer base. Big hit
28:47
timing matters at that particular point of time. Your idea does not matter what
28:52
is required for the market at that time. Today nobody takes
28:57
changes and adapting class note down these points that is for
29:02
your learning and for your class cahoot is just part of the exercise I I give
29:07
importance we have to give as part of the policy but also to learn note down
29:12
please make it a habit of active learning I'm not doubting your abilities
29:16
you all are smart brilliant but write once whether it is soft copy hard copy
29:22
right sorry to keep you waiting what
29:25
you have a company that does let's say furniture.
29:29
Mhm. And then something like happens. What
29:32
are some other possibilities? Okay, class a good question there. I
29:37
would like your creative minds. What if the company was a furniture
29:41
manufacturing company and COVID happens? What would you tweak, modify or change?
29:49
Sorry, let me change my question. Not furniture. I meant like classroom tables
29:53
and chairs specifically. Okay.
29:56
People a lot of people went into home office. So you can focus and brand with
30:00
that. Okay. Plus it was all work from home.
30:04
Yeah. And trust me sleeping is not an option
30:07
lying down. Okay. For your body or for your mind or for your soul. You can't
30:10
you can't work while sleeping make you sleepy.
30:14
Okay. So here switch from classroom to office home office which requires slight
30:19
modification but that's a big market. I'm sure you all have experience of
30:23
setting up your you know in your own homes because you have to work now you
30:27
have to study now everything online. I did that
30:29
adding more features and making it more accessible.
30:32
I would I would add one feature one one no one electric and then one uh webcam
30:39
or camera because our cameras are not so good. We had to add additional camera,
30:44
additional light setting, slight modifications. There is a market class.
30:49
Timing comes with opportunities and challenges. Every problem will have an
30:53
opportunity. Clear? Are you understanding?
31:02
Third class quality matters. I think one of
31:06
you discussed already quality. Please see to that quality is not
31:12
compromised and that this I brought mine wherever last class we had an issue the
31:17
range was not enough. So this time I brought my own good friend. I use this
31:21
for the last I bought this in 2014. The first thing I bought from my company's
31:26
money. I remember I told my partner look I'm spending on this. We didn't spend on
31:32
anything. Our company was based on training and consulting. I was the
31:36
product. I was the service. I used to go to colleges, universities or to
31:39
companies. I needed this for presentations. I bought this 11 years
31:45
ago Logitech
31:48
which means they have spent time on quality.
31:52
It has traveled empty number of countries with me, conferences, events,
31:57
workshops, invited talks. So durability matters. But all of this class
32:03
make it anchored to one particular product, service or industry
32:09
so that you have an anchor. Creating a whole new industry at times
32:15
can be risky. Anchor it to an industry, existing
32:20
industry. For example, Airbnb anchored in real
32:25
estate. Uber anchored in commute transport.
32:32
Now if you backtrack and closely observe the products and services you are using
32:37
throughout your life, every day of your life, the products or services are
32:41
anchored in a particular wellestablished industry.
32:48
You are not creating a new industry. You are just adding value to an existing
32:52
industry because taxes were there for a long
32:56
time. But the idea of having a business
33:02
without owning taxis, connecting commuters or consumers to taxi people
33:07
more efficiently, a billion dollar business. So you can
33:12
now book a four-wheeler, a three-wheer, a two-wheer also in different countries
33:17
for you to commute. Any doubts class here?
33:24
Any examples you'd like to share? You'd like to add value or agree,
33:30
disagree? I have a question. Um, so I was in
33:34
medical technology company. Yes. So um sorry medical devices like um camera
33:43
system equipment. So during right they didn't sold a lot of that because demand
33:49
was not there. Mhm. Everyone was focused on on
33:57
related prices. Yes.
33:59
Outside of masks and PE is there any other
34:08
what did they do or what? So did was it not enough market? No,
34:14
because it was very competitive because everyone started to shift into mask and
34:20
uh and mask and TV. Then after that over, we had like such a big stock of
34:26
mask and okay
34:28
because everyone the demand decrease but didn't plan for
34:32
it. Um they did shift to that but um my
34:37
concern is that any other thing they could have done? class open to the class
34:41
for your creative minds also. So here the company shifted to mass NP the J the
34:48
whole where we have we have worn all possible things we have washed clothes
34:51
every day of our lives we have done all nonsense things also scientifically
34:54
proven not we have done it because human tendency to do what others are doing
34:59
what else could a company do apart from just mask or manufacturing the pe kits
35:08
today nobody uses mask I don't see any mask in the classroom masks are still
35:12
used if people are sick or in hospitals now. So what could you have done? One
35:18
was you know plan the manufacturing and inventory which is not easy class. I'm
35:24
sure none none of us knew COVID last for 3 years.
35:28
Initially when the first report came we thought it is just one virus it'll go
35:34
down in few weeks that's it few weeks to few months 1 year 2 year 3 years. So
35:39
back here apply these things what would be attractive
35:44
maybe P kids for something create a new market out of it
35:48
like meal plans something or amusement so you wear similar kits
35:55
when you are in amusement park in Abu Dhabi you have snow world you
36:01
have to wear a kit just to you know curtail yourself from the water or from
36:05
the snow so these are if If you already have a
36:09
product, be creative to catch hold of markets or create new markets.
36:13
Even the masks were redesigned like they became beautiful like this tough mask
36:19
like no one. So fair enough.
36:22
Now many people use it. So it all depends back on these things
36:27
timeliness, attractiveness and durability.
36:30
Are we all clear? Yes, please. Any doubts? Any doubt?
36:35
Me? Yeah.
36:37
Okay. Fine. Plus, if this is clear, how do you identify opportunity?
36:43
This is the core of your unit, unit two. For today, we will discuss one by one.
36:49
We finish, we end the discussion for today. So, first one
36:54
observing trends class. What is trending today?
37:00

37:50

37:57

38:01
Sorry. Stanley. Stanley Cups. Okay, that's
38:05
trending. iPhone 17.
38:08
iPhone's iPhone is every year. It's the latest
38:12
Chinese EV. Chinese EV has step by step. It is not a
38:17
trend. It is a It is a well-crafted, you know, plan.
38:20
Pickle ball in India. Pickle ball in India. Okay.
38:25
Class, note it down or remember. Dig cams and Polaroids.
38:29
Sorry. Dig cams and Polaroids.
38:30
DJ cam and Polaroids. Okay, technological forces here class trends
38:35
here give you an platform to think about business opportunities.
38:42
How many companies started this Dubai chocolate?
38:46
Ice creams, Baskin Robbins, all companies have one
38:50
now. Sorry.
38:53
Yeah. So back here class the four different
38:58
types of trends are economic, social, technological and political.
39:06
Let me just break it down. I don't want to you to get scared. This is not a
39:10
chemical reaction. It is part it is a summary of your unit. If you understand
39:15
this now in the next few minutes you have understood the whole chapter.
39:24
first and foremost economic forces wherein the country's economy is pushing
39:38
for new businesses. Anybody from Norway by any chance?
39:46
Norway. Okay. Uh the story of Norway class. I was in Norway for a year as
39:50
part of my master's degree program and the dasma scholarship.
39:54
Norway was not a rich country. Sweden was, Denmark was. I don't know how many
39:59
of you have heard about Vikings and the history behind the wars. Norway was
40:04
mostly the battlefield for Swedish and Danish empires.
40:10
Out of the blue in 1970s, they found oil.
40:14
no people to dig oil. From them they started opening the
40:20
market, opening the country. That money was used to create businesses. Those
40:25
businesses create opportunities for more businesses
40:29
economic force because country got money very similar to GCC. When GCC found oil,
40:36
they transformed these deserts into world-class cities.
40:41
I don't know how many of you have seen Dubai, Abu Dhabi 30 years, 40 years ago.
40:45
My uncle first came in 1981 to Abu Dhabi. I show him Abu Dhabi photos
40:50
today. He is just shocked. As an engineer, he was the first batch of
40:55
engineers from India to come to Abu Dhabi. A degree was a sure shot.
41:02
Not today. Sorry to break it. That is why we have to be more entrepreneurial
41:06
today. Degree will not get you a job. You will get a job for yourself with
41:10
your skills and of course entrepreneur mindset. But is the is the first part
41:15
clear? Because of the state of economy of the
41:18
country, the spending patterns change. Disposable income. People have salaries.
41:24
People have money to spend. All of you one by one. Let us study
41:31
this. We are studying the first trend which is economic force. It could be
41:38
Norway. It could be GCC. Oil was one of the major thing found gas
41:45
initially they had even now they have.
41:50
Yeah. I mean to get in business. Exactly.
41:53
And then they started with real estate growing their market and then
41:58
that resulted in multiple businesses. a desert land converted into the most
42:04
visited or traveled or you know seen city economic situation. Are we all
42:10
clear with this class? Yeah.
42:14
Second demography
42:19
social trends any social trends you have observed in
42:24
your friend circle family circle what's changing the society today
42:31
challenges no now you're talking about dem what is
42:35
demography people business.
42:44
Technology. Yes. Anything which is
42:52
a fee. Study demography. Study of people. Geography.
43:03
Study of places, locations, plus study of population.
43:08
Anything with to do with population. Now,
43:13
what has changed in our societies? Fitness.
43:17
Fitness. Okay. Plus, fitness. Do you all agree?
43:22
Fitness was supposed to be part of life. Somewhere we started eating everything.
43:26
Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese, Arabic, Indian, American, Italian. Eat
43:30
everything. Our bodies have taken a toll. Okay class, our bodies are not
43:36
meant to eat everything. Our genes are determined by the place we lived and for
43:42
generations it is carried forward. Suddenly we started eating everything.
43:48
So fitness very good class. Note this down because of fitness.
43:54
The number of businesses have opened. Gyms 24-hour gyms Zumba classes. Look at
44:01
how many businesses have opened up. Martial arts.
44:05
Any examples class? your favorite examples.
44:07
Lazy economy. Lazy economy. Business opportunity.
44:13
Um convenience. Um back.
44:19
Okay. So class one thing what has changed drastically in the last two
44:25
generations is women and men studying and working
44:29
all over the world. Though though it the waves were different I this was part of
44:35
my sociology that was my minor in Europe. So I had studied people and how
44:40
things have changed. One thing was after the world war was after most of the
44:44
countries got independence the first change society was both women and men
44:50
working. So who is cooking?
44:54
That is when delivery came comes into your life.
44:58
Today you have no in 15 minutes you can order anything from mobile phone to
45:03
biryani it is delivered to your doorstep.
45:07
That culture has changed. My brother is in Saudi in Jedha. Recently they allowed
45:12
women to drive. Last country of the six GCC countries.
45:17
I've been to all of them. Saudi was the last. Recently they allowed women to
45:21
drive. Women could not drive by law of the country.
45:25
Now they are allowed to drive. But who will teach them to drive? Officially
45:32
businesses are opening every day. My brother tells
45:37
female instructors to teach females. But who is teaching those instructors?
45:43
Train the trainer. Look at how one social change
45:50
has resulted in class. This also can be it is connected. this to regulatory.
45:57
It's a political decision taken by the government that has resulted in social
46:01
change. People have accepted. Yes, please. Sorry, I kept you waiting.
46:07
Uh things that changed the economic force as well is that a lot of jobs
46:11
moved from like actual hand jobs like working jobs to desk jobs because of
46:15
robotics and AI. So now they're opened up a big market for chairs,
46:19
aerodynamics, pillows, still posture correctors, all of that stuff.
46:24
This third point okay it's related that's are we clear
46:30
it has resulted in change of people how they think now back to fitness
46:35
low calorie zero sugar all that yes high protein low calorie
46:41
low sugar no sugar all that is business opportunity
46:45
drinks energy drinks okay
46:47
okay because you have to stay awake class the previous generation never
46:52
worked after 5:00 p.m. whichever part of the world you come
46:56
from. Two generations before work was very clear sunrise to sunset.
47:03
Thanks to technology sitting in India you can work for a job in US time which
47:08
means you have to be awake the whole night
47:12
which means you need coffee energy drinks.
47:15
Yeah. All that is exam. Are you following
47:20
class? Because of social forces. Okay. Now batch the trends here. Any latest
47:25
trends in society you're watching which was not usual according to you?
47:30
No society people. Okay. So all those dating apps
47:47
WhatsApp WhatsApp class a classic. Yeah. Yeah.
47:51
Ladies, one discussion you want to share, you're sharing the class.
47:54
Sorry. Sorry. Okay. One person,
47:58
have you come across the dink? # dink. D I N K.
48:07
Double income. Yes.
48:12
Double income, no kids. Yeah.
48:18
job and they go there. So here it is husband full-time job,
48:21
wife full-time job and they decide before marriage. It is clear. I have
48:26
many of my own friends here in Dubai and in other cities.
48:31
It is it is viral. It is catching up. Wave started from west to east. It's now
48:38
global. Double income. No kids. You agree? You
48:41
disagree. That is your life. So back here plus one discussion.
48:49
So one societal change which means the couple has more money
48:57
and more time. If you have more money more time you need avenues to spend.
49:03
That is for you to create avenues for them to spend money. They have money
49:08
they have time. What a lovely customer base. Catch of them.
49:14
class usually as a business person you are worried people don't have money or
49:19
they don't have time here both money and time I'm a father of two kids trust me
49:23
from when Monday starts when Monday comes back I don't realize I teach I go
49:27
back evenings kids weekends kids over that's it
49:33
but without kids it means evenings are free weekends are free come up with
49:39
business ideas to keep them busy how one social force, one trending
49:46
concept. You agree, disagree, class, I'm not here to be judge. We should not be
49:51
judgmental. We are entrepreneurship students.
49:54
Everything comes with a business opportunity.
49:57
You agree personally or not is your decision. You want to have kids, it's
50:00
your decision. No, somebody's told no, that's your decision. But there is an
50:04
opportunity. Clear all of you. One last example.
50:10
Because of society what's happening because change in society we discuss
50:16
about gender women studying and working across the world now more than ever the
50:22
dating apps no longer arranged marriage parents selecting is the norm. Third
50:28
double income no kids that trend becoming viral.
50:36
Can you think of anything else from your own experiences in your own home
50:39
countries or countries you have visited? Something that's coming to Germany from
50:47
unless it's a self-driving car. Driving cars almost almost established
50:53
now. I'm not in Europe.
50:54
Not it. It's very new in Germany.
50:57
Now Germany is because well connected public transport is good. Walking is
51:00
still class. Now Europe I've lived in Europe.
51:05
The culture is more of you know commute through walking through public transport
51:09
buses because US does not have good public transport
51:15
and that is controlled by capitalist car makers. Okay. Now let me let me tell the
51:21
movie why to keep you in so much of suspension. Movie homework for the day.
51:26
If you have seen see it again. If you have not seen apply this how opportunity
51:32
comes when you are prepared to certain extent.
51:36
The movie name is Ford versus Ferrari. Now watch it again as a student not as a
51:45
viewer. Okay? As a student of business. Thus I want all of you those who have
51:51
not watched Blackberry add 1 hour 40 minutes to your calendar this week.
51:55
watch two movies for sure else Israel will cut
51:59
your marks I'll tell him those who don't watch
52:02
movies okay class back here
52:17
what I want class please enjoy the movie at the same time connect the theory to
52:23
the movie I want the connect next class when we meet.
52:28
Are we clear? We'll connect these trends. What all could be connected what
52:33
we discussed to the movie? Study the movie now.
52:42
Eyes come to technology class. Okay. Now gentlemen, one discussion. Let me finish
52:51
this. We have we just have how much time do we have still?
52:56
30 minutes. 30 minutes class. I need to finish these
52:58
four trends and wipe up gentle here. Third because of technology new
53:04
businesses opportunities come up. Now
53:11
can I have some examples? AI
53:14
very common now all over the world. Now AI definitely note it down.
53:22
Apart from AI class, what technology led to more business opportunities?
53:28
Chips. Chips where
53:31
where do you use like um for semiconductors for
53:37
processors? Trackers. Very good.
53:52
Because we have tracker in our phone, in our watch, tracker everywhere. We are
53:56
being tracked by everybody possible. Okay. There was a time we had nothing.
54:01
As kids, we used to just go away. We come back alive. Parents are happy.
54:08
Now we have watch tracker, mobile phone tracker, kids tracker, band tracker.
54:13
Okay. But yes, technology gives you more
54:16
opportunities. Yes. Sorry to keep you waiting.
54:20
You had something to share. Uh yes, sorry. So it might be like face
54:25
beauty industry. I guess all the beauty industries because now people make
54:29
surgeries for eyes, for face like females mostly do it when they're aged
54:34
old. Okay. So, so here class now even regular
54:40
I don't know how many of you know about the L'Oreal famous case study wherein
54:45
they use technology to map your phone using your phone to map your face and
54:51
buy plus when you buy online the only concern is we don't know how it looks on
54:55
us so we go to the shop and see but then AI allows
55:02
that particular company to tell you which shade looks Good. Not about the
55:07
surgeries and operations just you know maybe a blush or maybe maybe your you
55:11
know powder what you use. So this is where technology will give
55:16
you more business opportunities. How many of you have audio cassettes
55:21
now? Have you seen audio cassette in a
55:25
corner? Audio cassette
55:29
to hear music. I never had that.
55:31
You never had that. Am I so old class or are you so young?
55:36
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to make me feel better on a Thursday afternoon.
55:40
Okay, class. I had my mother threw it away over there. Too much too much space
55:45
in the house. We are shifting houses. She just discarded. Next came flash.
55:51
Yes, gentlemen. One discussion. We had audio cassettes then audio CDs.
55:58
Plus to write those CDs. We had CDs.
56:01
Recorders. We had recorders, companies, small shops, every locality had those
56:07
recording shops. How one technology gave business ideas.
56:11
Then then
56:13
USB USB to manufacture USB
56:17
128 MB. When my university gifted me 128 MB flash in Spain, I was so happy.
56:24
That was a big thing. Now, no need of anything. Cloud iTunes was a disruptor.
56:32
iTunes taught the world music does not require physical product
56:39
technology all that are example
56:45
best Bluetooth whether it is Samsung or these okay so back here class new
56:52
technology giving rise to new business opportunities
56:56
with one technology you have so many businesses
56:59
last Plus uh as a teacher I try my best not
57:06
to discuss two things in the classroom. Politics and religion sensitive
57:11
different people different perspectives but both are part of business.
57:17
Politics and religion affects business whether you like it or not.
57:23
We are students of business. Right or wrong again no judges. Did you
57:29
come across the boycott movement recently
57:33
in in all over the world? Starbucks. Starbucks recorded losses for
57:40
the first time ever in the history of their company
57:45
just because of the boycott. Now boycott was mostly social. There were countries
57:50
which also boycotted like it was a country stand. Countries take some
57:55
stand. Sometimes companies take some stand, sometimes individuals take a
57:59
stand and that might vary. Officially UAE did not boycott Starbucks. UAE
58:06
government made it clear we are not affecting businesses.
58:12
Companies took their individual stance. Individuals took their individual
58:16
stance. Right or wrong? Again, we are not here
58:20
to judge people. people on both the sides who were for who were against they
58:26
took the stance of a political issue but because of that we saw boycott movement
58:34
in different countries in Oman in Saudi in UAE also McDonald's KFC boycott now
58:41
when you boycott one particular company or a few companies which means
58:47
there is a demand people are not going but people want
58:52
That is where new companies came up. So that is where Albbe
58:57
I don't know how many of you have come across this. It is in Dubai Mall and
59:01
Alway is similar to your KFC.
59:07
Yeah. It's a Egyptian uh you know franchisee.
59:11
All over they recorded highest profits last two years.
59:17
Look, one region people are dying. Other parts of the world people are
59:22
boycotting. You do this as a business opportunity.
59:29
Two more companies came up in Saudi Kudu in Oman Cuckoo just because you're the
59:36
boycott is strong people are boycotting other companies. There is a market a
59:42
need. So let us start a new very similar I don't know how many of you have seen
59:47
Kins. Kins is a brand of soft drinks. You
59:52
close the cover. You just drink no almost no difference compared to Pepsi.
59:59
Pepsi 7up. Kins Kins equivalent. Pepsi Kinsey equivalent 7up. No difference.
1:00:06
Plus I'm not promoting fast food or sugary drinks. you know I know they're
1:00:10
not good for the body business of it how one political or regulatory or social
1:00:18
combined with both there are some countries which officially class thanks
1:00:21
to this I'm know I'm sure you're following the international news and Mr.
1:00:25
Trump and his taxes and tariffs every day. Countries now are taking stance.
1:00:31
So that becomes political. When countries take a stance, it's a
1:00:39
political decision. When countries tell we ban the imports from this country,
1:00:45
which means people want that's a business opportunity. Going
1:00:50
back here class, are we clear? All of us at every step there is a business
1:00:57
opportunity right or wrong. Whether you agree with
1:01:01
Dink or not, whether you agree with boycott or not, whether you agree with
1:01:05
tariffs or not, whether you agree with visa regulations or not, there is a
1:01:10
business opportunity and that business opportunity is what
1:01:14
you should be ready for. Clear?
1:01:21
four different categories. Each category has some there are overlap social and
1:01:28
political overlap or it could be re regulatory and economic both where
1:01:35
because of regulatory policy it helped the economy or did not help the economy
1:01:41
and that gave rise to business opportunity.
1:01:45
Organic food that's a big business opportunity.
1:01:51
wherein you have a trail of you show evidence based that your that your raw
1:01:56
material till your final product is organic.
1:02:00
Uh some of you mentioned about low high protein, low calorie all these are
1:02:06
regulatory, social, demographic and economic certain extent.
1:02:13
Clear? So that is example class here. economic.
1:02:17
Of course, we have some examples from different countries where you car
1:02:21
pooling a classic example when the costs are
1:02:25
going high of commute. When people are wanting to save money, you have car
1:02:31
pooling. Now apps have one app being one of the student startup which got student
1:02:37
seed funding in Abu Dhabi was integrating a small feature in the apps.
1:02:41
Now delivery apps how they work. We all are maybe living in one apartment. He
1:02:46
orders from Talabad. I order from Talabad. It's individual order like car
1:02:51
pooling, delivery pooling. Are you getting my point? Plus car
1:02:56
pooling is two three people in the same apartment building or a complex they
1:03:00
pull together and they go to work. They share the cost.
1:03:05
Same concept. Apply this in delivery pooling. If the orders are from the same
1:03:10
building or same particular complex, pull that. That is their app. app
1:03:16
they're creating the app can be integrated into the delivery apps app
1:03:19
for an app like tabby have you come across tabby
1:03:24
here plus tabby is an app which allows you to
1:03:28
pay in installments when you go and shop if the shop has subscribed
1:03:34
to tabby instead of paying 1,000 dirhams you have to pay 250 dirhams four
1:03:39
installments dirhams in 4 months just one feature added to the billing
1:03:46
amount. That's economic forces, social forces about society, about people,
1:03:54
about youth, about old people. We have countries with aging population,
1:03:58
countries with young population. Two different ends.
1:04:03
Young population, youth working, getting money, earning money, they want to spend
1:04:07
money. Concerts, festivals, restaurants, all these are business opportunities.
1:04:13
Old people, health care, home health care, all these are the other side of
1:04:19
the spectrum. Technology we all talked about one of
1:04:23
you told about digital technology and photos I think comes here because of
1:04:27
that so many other business opportunities. Last one is of course
1:04:31
class politics, religion are an intersection for business. They have an
1:04:36
impact and that is a business opportunity.
1:04:49
So second approach here is to solve the
1:04:54
problem. So first is observe the trends. Second is to solve the problem. Now a
1:04:59
problem which is in the society and part of our everyday life here that becomes a
1:05:05
business opportunity. Getting the paperwork done was a big
1:05:11
hassle. That is where agents came up in different countries. Now we have startup
1:05:16
agencies where you just have to go to them with their idea and money. They'll
1:05:20
do the work, paperwork, registration, etc.
1:05:24
Solving a problem, what customers are facing in a country. So that could be as
1:05:31
big as energy problem. I don't know how many of you are
1:05:36
observing on Alen Dubai road we have one of the biggest solar panel
1:05:42
for the country the problem of energy is being solved at
1:05:47
a macro level country level third approach class is finding gaps
1:05:55
where products are there services are there but not that great
1:06:02
that is where Talabad and all The ery apps come into picture. Food was there,
1:06:09
delivery was there but better delivery, faster delivery, tracking the order that
1:06:14
was missing. So all these apps class Uber food delivery apps are not
1:06:21
inventions, nothing new. They solved a problem of gap. Taxis were there. Enough
1:06:27
of fights arguments regarding the fair. Now no hassle. Book a taxi, it'll come
1:06:32
to you. So to wrap up the session for today and
1:06:36
go to your cahoot three approaches first one what is it
1:06:42
observing very good and there are how many types
1:06:47
second third
1:06:51
thank you very much that's it okay so this was what I wanted to share with all
1:06:56
of you class uh that's an example here do we have time okay just I just want to
1:07:02
show this video 15. So, Cahoot is fine enough.
1:07:26
How many of you know Shark Tank class? How many of you know about Shark Tank?
1:07:33
How how many of you don't know never seen any video of Shark Tank? Anything?
1:07:38
Shark Tank US, Shark Tank India, Shark Tank UK. All of you right.
1:07:59
Is it right? How is this? Okay.
1:08:11
Class 10 minutes. All of you. Silence please. 10 minutes video. 5
1:08:18
minutes cahoot. We wrap up. We have exact time here. I want all your
1:08:21
attention. Phones inside. I want you all to study this. A classic example of what
1:08:28
we discussed for the last 45 minutes. First in the tank is a new innovation in
1:08:34
the fitness accessory space. Hi sharks. I'm Las
1:08:48
and I'm B. We're from the Magic 5. We all know sharks have excellent vision
1:08:53
underwater, but it's not easy for everyone else. And that is why we wear
1:08:58
swimming goggles. But most swimming goggles today either
1:09:01
leak or uncomfortable. And it makes total sense. Of course they do. All of
1:09:06
our faces are different. Swimming goggles are one size fits all.
1:09:09
And that is why we have created the world's first custom fitted swimming
1:09:14
goggles. Wow. It only takes 13 seconds to scan
1:09:17
your face and will deliver the goggles directly to your doorstep.
1:09:21
Our appbased scanning technology ensures a perfectly fitting goggle with no
1:09:27
leakage and no marks after use. Some of the world's very best swimmers and
1:09:32
triathletes, they already wear our goggles.
1:09:36
But we want all swimmers to get a pair of our goggles. And to accomplish that,
1:09:40
we seeking $500,000 for 2 and a half% of our company.
1:09:46
Wow. So, sharks, who wants to help create
1:09:49
magic? Sharks, in front of you, you have two
1:09:53
goggles. You can try them on, but they won't fit you because you haven't
1:09:57
scanned your face. So, we haven't been able to produce a pair of goggles for
1:10:00
you. Have a look at the part of the goggle that touches your face. You can
1:10:04
see that gasket is different from the two goggles that you have. And that is
1:10:08
really our secret source. And what do they sell for?
1:10:11
$55. They're very dark.
1:10:13
That is for outdoor swimming. So we have like uh ranges from super light one,
1:10:17
totally clear to very very dark. And the design of the goggle means that you have
1:10:20
a great peripheral view which is super useful so you can navigate better. How
1:10:25
big is the goggle market in the US and Europe? 2.2 billion.
1:10:29
Wait, how. 2 billion. No, there's no chance. In the US, I'm surprised. I have
1:10:33
three young sons. They wear goggles. All of their friends wear goggles. But for a
1:10:38
$20 million valuation, I'm guessing you've already sold a lot of these.
1:10:42
Yeah. So, we have uh 40,000 customers so far. Our lifetime revenue is 3 million.
1:10:47
When did you start? We started in 2018 and we've been
1:10:51
growing like three times every year. It's so logical. I mean, my glasses are
1:10:56
made for me. Why have swimming goggles never been custom made?
1:11:00
So, we are a triathlete, both of us. I went on a vacation. I forgot my goggles,
1:11:06
but I had to swim. And then I purchased all the goggles that I could find. None
1:11:11
of them fit me. Then I called the best triathlete that I knew at the time. That
1:11:15
was Rashford, my nephew. Oh, he's your nephew.
1:11:17
Yes. Where are you from?
1:11:19
We're from Denmark. Oh, I don't understand why you're only
1:11:23
charging $55. Why aren't these $99? So, we wanted to charge in the middle of
1:11:29
the other high-end goggles, right? We didn't want price to be an issue for our
1:11:34
customers. What does it cost to make it?
1:11:36
It costs $14. Okay. And what is the customer
1:11:39
acquisition cost? That is $24.
1:11:42
Okay. So guys, nobody comes in here asking for $500,000 for 2.5%. That's
1:11:49
always to protect your previous investors. So tell us how much money
1:11:52
have you raised? We've raised $1.5 million. At what
1:11:55
valuation? The last valuation that we had was $9
1:11:59
million. Can you walk us through how the ramp has gone over let's say the last 3
1:12:03
years? In 2018 when we delivered the first
1:12:06
goggles our revenue was 180. The year after it was 370. Last year it was 1.2
1:12:13
million. Wow. And so far this year we're at 1.5.
1:12:16
Impressive. So where are you based and where do you
1:12:20
manufacture? So I moved to Charlotte and Rasmus moved
1:12:23
to New York. So we basically convinced our wives to
1:12:26
make the bet and move to the US. Why did you choose to move to the US?
1:12:30
The market here is better and the relative number of swimmers is slightly
1:12:34
higher than Europe. So then you're manufacturing. Where is
1:12:38
that done? So we get some of our parts from China
1:12:40
and then all the customization happens in Charlotte, North Carolina.
1:12:44
Do you have any type of IP coverage? We have a utility patent on the fitting
1:12:48
algorithm. So you manufacture the goggles and you have to customize them
1:12:52
to fit. What is that process like? Yeah. So we used advanced robotics
1:12:57
technology to do it. Are you using third party robotics or
1:13:00
are you developing it all yourself? All the software to control the robot is
1:13:03
of course made by us. Not all companies can make robotics,
1:13:05
right? Mark's a goggle company, not a robotics.
1:13:08
No, it's a robotics company that makes goggles right now.
1:13:10
Exactly. Right. Exactly. The whole concept was changed. We assume
1:13:17
it's a it's a gole manufacturing company. Am I
1:13:22
right? No, it's a robotics company which
1:13:27
manufactures goggles also because their strength is not goggles.
1:13:34
Their need was goggles as swimmers. Their strength was inbuilt inhouse AI.
1:13:41
It's a robotics company. One of their product is goggles. Tomorrow they might
1:13:45
sell something else. They might send vacuum cleaners.
1:13:51
AI automated vacuum cleaners look at how things will go. So what we discussed all
1:13:56
the trends the forces the gap in the market the problem they solved and
1:14:01
society I don't know how many of you are aware of school curriculum every week
1:14:04
swimming is compulsory I grew up playing only football or cricket swimming was
1:14:09
summer camp parents used to put us or weekends
1:14:13
but swimming part of a school curriculum societal and regulatory requirement by
1:14:20
regulatory Abu Dhabi education ministry makes it mandatory
1:14:24
Swimming should be part of the weekly curriculum of kids,
1:14:29
which means goggles, which means business opportunity.
1:14:32
Look, when you have a unique niche and you're developing a new category, it's
1:14:36
not where you are, it's where you'll be. I'll offer you the $500,000, but I want
1:14:40
7 12%. and I don't want you to negotiate with
1:15:03
everybody cuz you already know that there may be other value. That means he
1:15:07
doesn't want you to hear anything else. If you're more concerned about that
1:15:10
equity, the two of us have an offer you may find very interesting. Okay,
1:15:14
guys. I already have a robotics company that I'm an investor in. I have AI
1:15:18
companies, I have machine learning companies, I have AR companies, and
1:15:22
obviously being in the sports industry, I
1:15:24
may not want to give up 7 and a half%. Well, that's why if you if that's too
1:15:27
much, then I'll listen to a counter. Just so you have it, let me give you an
1:15:32
offer that two sharks want to give you and you can get both of the sales and
1:15:35
the technology. So, how about this deal? Venture debt
1:15:39
deal. $500,000. All right. Between the two of us, and we're going to charge you
1:15:43
$3 a unit until we recoup 1.5 million. Then the royalty goes away, but we're
1:15:48
only going to ask for 5% equity and you get two sharks
1:15:53
or Rasmus, let me tell you. So, my daughter was a world-class swimmer. In
1:15:58
fact, she was ranked in the top 10 in the world in the butterfly when she was
1:16:02
12 years old. I've spent 18 years at swimming pools. I get this market. I'll
1:16:08
do 500,000 for 5%. No royalty. I just want to say what you need are
1:16:13
partners. So, with Mr. Wonderful. You know what? You're going to get
1:16:18
nothing. Nothing. Exactly. Nothing except for what will help you
1:16:23
scale your business. I've been the CEO of three different companies in Silicon
1:16:26
Valley. I know how to build extremely large audiences cost effectively. You
1:16:31
have an amazing product, but now how are we going to bring it to the masses?
1:16:35
That's the kind of problem that I've solved over the last 20 years.
1:16:41
Wait a minute. You need somebody who will really help you blast these out,
1:16:46
sell them. I'm a product person. I like to blow up sales. I like to move fast
1:16:50
and I like to blitz the market. And that's what I'm good at.
1:16:53
So, Lori, do you have an offer? Not going to offer you tech, but I'm
1:16:56
going to offer you a lot of sales. I mean, I have Mark and I have Robert who
1:17:02
have both given you offers and they're on the tech end. And I would join either
1:17:06
one of them to blow up. Well, I'm asking them, do either of you
1:17:10
want me to come in? That was a very good question, but I
1:17:16
think that it comes down to what were you hoping to get here today in the next
1:17:21
short while? Do you need to boost sales? Do you need to boost strategy? Do you
1:17:27
need to boost tech? Guys, guys, we we've all been
1:17:30
entrepreneurs and we know you can't choose. You have to do both. You need to
1:17:35
generate sales and you need to answer the strategic questions about how to
1:17:39
best build the business. Well, uh, Nero has a fantastic track record doing this.
1:17:43
I mean, he can The only thing I'll tell you is I've
1:17:45
been first or second investor in Six Unicorns. So, it's not like I don't know
1:17:49
how to grow companies that I've built. Guys, look, I think I'd be happy to
1:17:54
partner with Lori. I'm happy with the 5%. How do we split that 5%. Guys, we'll
1:17:59
drop down 1% just to be more competitive because we're asking for five, we'll go
1:18:04
to four. We want that royalty structure in place, but it's not perpetual. We get
1:18:08
back our capital. Well, it's not even that great a return, but we're stay in
1:18:11
the game. You get three times the capital, right?
1:18:13
No, we're only making a million bucks off 500,000. So, we're willing to go
1:18:17
down on the equity. And guys, like I said, I'll listen to a
1:18:20
counter offer. And we have a counter.
1:18:22
And so will we. Yeah.
1:18:24
Robert and I are going to do the 500,000 6%.
1:18:28
No royalty. No royalty.
1:18:31
Wasn't the offer five? It was.
1:18:33
That was the first offer. So now it gotten worse.
1:18:36
Got worse by a percent. But you get two sharks.
1:18:38
I'm happy to do 500,000 for 5% on my own. I think Lori brings a tremendous
1:18:44
amount of it that gives you the sales, but we need a little more equity.
1:18:48
All of these offers that are five and six and 7 1/2 cause pain to your
1:18:53
existing shareholder base. We understand that. Neurov and I are going to change
1:18:56
our offer yet again down to 3% equity. So now we're totally aligned with
1:19:01
existing shareholders. If you think this company's going to be worth a lot,
1:19:05
the equity is where the real value is long term.
1:19:14
Guys, guys, I got to get this deal. I'm going to change my offer.
1:19:20
I'll give you 1 million for 6 and 12.
1:19:25
Wow. It's a crazy offer for me right now.
1:19:32
We'll take it. Good job. Yeah.
1:19:39
Thank you. Thank you. I'm excited. Good job, guys. Congrats. Nice job.
1:19:43
Great job, guys. Woohoo. Okay. Perfect. That's crazy.
1:19:48
Good stuff. Robert was our favorite investor going into the show. Uh, he can
1:19:54
really help us take the goggle business to the next level.
1:19:56
You're all in now. I'm bummed that I lost that one. I think where you went
1:20:00
wrong was partnering with Kevin because when you have an athletic product
1:20:06
I'm a fine-tuned athlete, Robertity at the right time.
1:20:13
$1 million. Okay, quickly cahoot and you wrap up the session.
1:20:22
I will upload the case. I'll request the team to upload the case. Just the
1:20:27

8:07
Class, this is your assignment for next week for 20 marks. So, you should focus.
8:12
There's no choice. Please learn what to do next class. I'm not talking enough.
8:18
I've talked next class we see your videos in the class.
8:22
Mhm. We see your creativity.
8:25
So you need to upload the video and present the video in the class.
8:30
We are all investors. I am an investor. 20 marks. Big investment.
8:36
Okay. For your business model. So welcome to session five.
8:42
I'll give you time to talk. You have to talk today to discuss and finalize the
8:47
plan before next week. Before we meet, you should complete the video, upload
8:52
the video, be ready in the class on the LMS. The guidelines are there. This
8:57
session and the template will be uploaded after the class by the Tet
9:02
team. To begin with the basic difference class one thing which all of you must
9:09
understand business plan is the last step
9:13
for I don't know what reason it is considered or assumed as a first step
9:19
there's a very clear flow business idea business model business plan let us have
9:26
a quick look at the difference and then go to business model.
9:42
The volume should be fine. to the widget.
10:33
another cost and then you're going to be selling it at a price and uh that should
10:38
end up business a business model is quite
10:50
different from a business. Okay. Yes. Class silence, please. Just a
10:56
quick look. It's a short summary, hardly a minute.
11:04
A business model is simply a discussion of how you make money.
11:09
So, if you sell widgets, you're going to be buying widgets from somewhere at
11:14
some cost. you're going to be adding some value, a paint job or something
11:20
else to the widget at another cost and then you're going to be selling it at a
11:24
price and uh that should end up making you a profit on the sale of that
11:29
particular widget. That is your business model. Class can have one discussion
11:33
please gentlemen don't disturb the class. Let's have a
11:37
look. Let's start our discussions with a basic idea. What is the difference
11:42
between a business plan which is your macro project? It is end of term
11:46
submission as a group. Before that, what is due for next week and the
11:51
presentation is the business model. Multiply that by 10,000 widgets and now
11:55
you've got a business. A business model is quite different from a business plan.
12:00
A business plan is a goal with a series of steps to achieving that particular
12:06
goal. But as an early stage company, your goal might be to uncover or refine
12:13
your business model. So your business model, you have a suspicion that selling
12:18
a certain color of widgets to a certain set of customers with a certain set of
12:24
marketing plans is going to work. Your business plan says that over the next
12:29
three months, you're going to have these particular tests to determine what
12:33
color, what group of customers, and what marketing plan is.
12:37
In simple words class, the whole idea of business model is to help you all, not
12:43
the investors, not the customers, to help you all
12:48
illustrate the idea. Your business idea is in your mind. We're just discussing
12:51
it as of now. But how do you illustrate this on a canvas? How can others see?
12:56
How can your own team members understand more importantly potential investors and
13:01
potential customers? So business model canvas is one tool is one framework
13:06
which we use. There are number of frameworks for business model. One of my
13:12
favorite which I've applied as a consultant I've applied as an
13:15
entrepreneur and I like as a researcher is business model canvas which is a
13:20
simple nine block framework. Our duty today is to understand these nine blocks
13:28
have a example understand the example and then proceed to last part of today's
13:35
session. So we are discussing business model and then we are seeing also if
13:39
anything happens how can you solve a problem at the stage of business model
13:44
development. To begin with class the whole idea here is the central why.
13:51
What is the value you're adding? Why are you doing this business? The central
13:56
core of business model canvas is value. Why are you in the business?
14:07
To add what value and to whom? Who are your target customers? So, right
14:13
hand side is all about customers. Customers, how do you reach out to them?
14:19
What are the relationship management initiatives? How do you develop a
14:23
relationship with your customers who will come back to you again and again?
14:27
Class, firsttime customers is not your business. First time customers are
14:32
mostly because they were attracted by the viral campaigns. They were
14:37
influenced by influencers that is not your real business. The
14:42
returning customer and the community which is built that is
14:48
your real business. So back here class, how do you reach out to them? What
14:52
relationship you build and all this? How much money will you get? Uh sorry to
14:59
break your myths if you assume more the viral
15:04
campaign more the money. Not necessarily.
15:08
Those likes, those repost, those shares, those reshares should translate into
15:13
money. That's your revenue. The balance sheet in your statement does not
15:19
consider your likes and repost. Yes, there might be a reason but business
15:25
sees revenues. On the left hand side is the behind the
15:29
scenes which nobody sees. Customers don't care. When you go to a restaurant,
15:34
do you care who was the chef from where did they hire? What was his problem? No.
15:39
Was the dish served good or not? So what activities
15:45
to carry out the activities what resources who are the partners in
15:49
today's world don't try to do everything you have your partners outsource as much
15:55
as possible but not the core for example Teta a very good example startup they
16:02
have outsourced campus one of the biggest cost for a university is campus
16:08
they don't have campus this is not their campus you go to India
16:12
not their campus. You go to Singapore, not their campus. They have business
16:15
partners in all these countries who are helping them in the business of
16:20
education. Finally, what is the cost? This revenue should always be greater
16:27
than the cost. If not, please shut down.
16:36
class business model helps you to understand whether it is worth it to
16:41
continue. So how do we understand this model? Let
16:46
us look at one example through a video. I have chosen drop
16:51
shipping in this class. How many teams do we have quickly?
16:55
I was told there are no numbers. There are names
16:57
like eight or nine. Nine.
16:59
Nine. I think all the classes almost the same number. Eight or nine. And in each
17:03
team five of you correct? Six. Five to six. 526 4 5 6 Okay, how
17:08
many of you are choosing a business which is not your drop shipping business
17:11
for this course? For this course, a business idea is
17:17
required. Are you choosing your drop shipping business for this course also
17:21
or you choosing separate idea? Drop shipping. That is why I have used
17:28
the example majority I see in the four sections. I see maybe I think two to
17:33
three teams which are not choosing drop shipping. That is your decision. I'm
17:38
open for both since you're doing this integrate and do it better is my
17:43
suggestion. But I'm open for if you want to have drop shipping project separately
17:47
done and you want to have separate project for this. I'm open for your
17:51
decision. Let us have a look understand this before you wind up for today
17:55
because next week you should be prepared with your video uploaded on LMS and
17:59
present it in the class. Not just one, three different stains.
18:24
Removing them is impossible. My dear Tom, goodbye. I have tied liquid.
18:30
Impossible to remove such stains. With tide, nothing is impossible. New Tide
18:35
Liquid Triple Power is three times stronger than all body detergents for
18:39
better cleaning and brightness. Let's talk about building a business
18:43
model using the business model canvas. There are nine building blocks we can
18:48
use to understand your business, identify gaps, and create new
18:52
opportunities. You can start with any of the blocks. So, let's take a look at who
18:57
your customers and users are. What are their characteristics and what jobs do
19:01
they need to get done? Next look at the value proposition
19:05
class. The first step is who are your target customers? Please don't start a
19:11
business with a premise. Our business is for everybody. That's a first step
19:16
wherein you fail. Please have a target segment in mind.
19:21
Maybe in future as you evolve, as you become better, you might have a broader
19:26
customer base. Right now it is who are your target segment
19:33
and what value are you adding to them? What value do you offer that the
19:41
customers need? Is it a product or service and what differentiates you from
19:46
others in the market? Next, you have the channels. These represent how you will
19:50
reach your customers. Will you have a physical presence, for example, a retail
19:54
store? or you do it virtually via website or mobile device.
20:00
Relationships simple class channels are class note it down
20:05
remember it I want you all to understand this part of your cahoots questions end
20:09
of the session so channels are how will you reach out to them how should
20:15
customers know that you are in the market is it through websites through
20:20
apps through physical stores or tie-ups with others partnership with others
20:26
channels are ultimately how are you reaching out to the customers.
20:31
My favorite example is Pepsi or Coca-Cola. I'm not promoting
20:38
carbonated drinks, sugar drinks. You know, I know they are not good for your
20:42
health. Okay. Ronaldo has told explicitly water is the best drink you
20:47
should have. I truly agree with him being his fan. But business point of
20:53
view, I am fan of these two companies. I have not yet gone to any city around
20:59
143. Facebook had this feature. Whichever city you go can pin. I think
21:04
there are other other social media platforms. We used to I used to continue
21:07
that approximate 143 cities in 29 countries. I have not come across one
21:15
city till now which does not have Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Remote island in
21:20
Indonesia or high up ice mountains in Finland. I have found these two which
21:26
means their channels system is extremely good.
21:31
Plus they're selling sugar water all over the world. It's not the product, it
21:36
is the channel which has helped these companies to
21:40
become such large corporations. So channels are underrated
21:45
and the most important part of your business. How are you reaching out to
21:49
customers? And that's what differentiates. You see
21:53
those delivery apps here in Dubai. Dubai has one of the largest delivery apps
21:57
among all the emirates in UAE. And look at how they differentiate like noon 15
22:02
minutes. That's the promise in India. I was told 10 minutes delivery.
22:09
So this is how the channel system works recharing out to customers class. While
22:15
this is good the relationship what matters to business. How do you make a
22:21
customer buy from you? Again, I didn't know about this Tim Hortons
22:26
app. One of your classmates told me in the next section. So, I downloaded them
22:30
before coming to this class. The point system,
22:34
it helps them to see to that the customer gains the points. So, redeem
22:39
the points you buy again. So loyalty programs, point system, miles in
22:44
airlines, coupons, vouchers, all these are
22:50
examples of customer relationship initiatives.
22:55
Now from your side, can I have examples for these two channels and customer? How
23:00
did you get to know a company and why will you continue buying from this
23:05
company? Apple. Apple.
23:09
Apple. What what is the thing which you one specific example
23:17
iOS iOS
23:20
but iOS is what value they're adding correct that's a product
23:24
but why will you buy Apple again and again only for iOS
23:27
they have they get they're good for the ecosystem other than that the what was
23:31
it called student discount for college students which I am right now
23:34
okay they help me with my giving me a
23:38
discount free airs student plus Uber has student feature
23:44
if you're a student. Yeah, Uber has student feature. Yes, you
23:48
should. You should please class uh just a reminder apart from this course as
23:53
students you will have so many items which are for discount which are
24:00
you know for value for money. Please use use your student card especially in
24:05
different countries. Please use to the maximum. Amusement parks, museums,
24:10
libraries, all of these have certain discounts or offers for students. Make
24:15
the best use of it. Okay. I miss my student card. We employee card we have
24:21
some offers too, but student card is the best. When you have less money, the
24:25
offers are more exciting. Okay. Not that I have more money now, but yes,
24:32
compared to student life, it's much better. Okay, back here class, back to
24:35
the discussions here. Customer relationship. Any further examples apart
24:40
from Apple? How did you get to know about Teta?
24:45
How did you get to know this? Okay,
24:51
I think the last time 79 students
24:58
took the program because of NAS daily out of I think 100 plus this time it is
25:03
more the number is more but imagine first time when I myself thought it's a
25:08
scam I never responded to their WhatsApp message because some unknown Indian
25:12
number I thought some scam I'm not even responding but then when the person
25:16
called Dr. Dr. I met you in Dubai. I'm like whom did I meet in Dubai? And then
25:21
I realized so I met by accident. I met in an event and that person remembers
25:27
Teta team member who had come for a different event and I was there through
25:32
my friend's invite but Naz Dhi was the one which actually
25:37
helped them. So NAS Daily was the channel of course through the social
25:42
media platforms like Instagram, Tik Tok. This is a real example. You are part of
25:49
this example how one unknown startup class Tetra was not known one year
25:54
before. At least now you all know and I'm happy to be really frank. You are
25:58
more stable. You are more comfortable and thanks to the cohort we had the
26:04
session zero. I remember seeing some faces on the online session we had. It
26:08
helped you all to know each other before you came here. I'm sure you all knew
26:12
some people before coming here. Previous batch knew nothing. They escaped with
26:16
Dubai. Dubai looks good on Instagram. But trust me, when you come here, when
26:21
you start living, homesickness, first time outside your home country, your
26:25
people, it is challenging. That is why customers need to be comfortable through
26:31
channels and customer relationships. Are we clear all of you? These leading to
26:38
money that is what is the requirement here.
26:41
Important to acquire, engage and grow your customer base. Do you have great
26:46
customer service people who can respond rapidly to any questions or problems? Is
26:50
it through loyalty programs or a strong social media strategy?
26:54
Revenue streams are the various ways that we can generate money. These might
26:58
include licensing fees, sales of physical goods and services, advertising
27:03
and sponsorship. All of the items on the right of the canvas represent what the
27:07
customers see and interact with. The left side of the
27:11
class. This is all seen by customers. So you need to be the face and a good face
27:17
because they see you, they judge you and they decide whether they need to go with
27:21
you or not. behind the scenes are even more important but less in the
27:27
limelight. This is where the strength of companies lies.
27:33
Canvas represents the infrastructure and operations needed to support and run
27:37
your business. The key resources are what your company
27:42
needs to make your business model work. Do you need technical skills, physical
27:46
labor, or perhaps a physical store? What activities do you need to excel in? Is
27:51
it strong marketing, innovative design, or high-quality services? And what
27:56
partners will help you achieve this? Do you have to do everything yourself or
28:02
how can you leverage their expertise? The cost structure will help you map out
28:06
and understand what it will take to make your business a reality or for an
28:11
existing business where you might improve further. Business model can
28:15
class the difference between this is one step where students commit a mistake. I
28:19
want you want to be clear key activities and key resources. Key activities are
28:26
the work you do at a daily level. Daily, monthly, yearly or or even some
28:32
businesses which are very aggressive and fast-paced, they do on an hourly basis.
28:38
Activities for to do those activities. What kind of people you require?
28:43
Resources you require. Resources could be human, could be financial, could be
28:48
technological. And this what partners can be actually
28:53
be part of the business. Again back to tetra example the key partner of tetra
28:58
is universities because they don't spend efforts and
29:02
money on campus. You don't need a campus for 4 months. You need if you are
29:06
planning for to stay for 10 years 20 years. So here partnering with
29:10
universities is the biggest strength of tetar as a startup. If you see
29:16
established universities, they don't have in-house employees for cleaning.
29:21
Cleaning is outsourced to an agency. That's a partner. Technology is
29:26
outsourced to either Apple or Dell in schools or colleges here in UAE. They
29:32
don't want to spend money and efforts in having a in-house team for all those
29:37
things. You have a better option outside and a cheaper option. And finally, what
29:42
is the cost structure? How can you evaluate the cost of it and this should
29:48
be lesser than the money you will make. Overall class nine blocks which will
29:54
help you all to understand your business idea and to convey this idea to others
30:00
who are investors or who are your potential customers.
30:04
And this provides a central space to collaborate, discuss and grow and evolve
30:09
your business model over time. I will now walk you through a case study
30:14
so you can see the canvas in action using may.com an innovative furniture
30:18
store based in the United Kingdom. Class uh for next 4 minutes can I have
30:23
can I have attention please a real example next class what is expected from
30:28
you is a video like this wherein it showcases exactly what is your business
30:34
about. This is an example it will be uploaded
30:38
on LMS. I want you all to understand any doubts, any discussion so that before
30:42
you leave today, you are clear about your 20 mark assignment. It's a group
30:46
assignment. Everybody must contribute. How you contribute, how you divide the
30:51
work, it's up to you. I don't like micromanaging.
30:54
One of you want to design, one of you want to act, one of you want to direct,
30:57
one of you want to edit the video, shoot the video, finalize the script. I leave
31:02
it to you. The example is for your reference.
31:07
You want to have it like this or any other way. There is no rule. It's a
31:10
creative course. The only rule is maximum 3 minutes. 2 to 3 minutes is
31:16
what I envisage. Not more than that, please. Because we need all the teams to
31:21
be present and present within the timeline given to us next time when we
31:25
meet. So this is an example. The business idea was inspired by
31:31
Ningley, the CEO of May.com. He wanted to buy a new sofa, but the one he wanted
31:36
cost a hefty £3,000. Ming's friend said that was far too
31:41
expensive and he could buy the same sofa in China for £300.
31:45
Ming realized that there were probably more people like him in the market who
31:49
wanted great design and if he cut out the agents, importers, and showrooms, he
31:53
could sell these designs at affordable prices, creating a viable business. The
31:58
main channel to reach customers is through the website along with live chat
32:02
to answer customer questions immediately.
32:06
The original maid.com website was launched with only a handful of products
32:09
and partners allowing the team to test out ideas to see which ones would stick.
32:14
So class the value they are adding to customers is price. Almost the same
32:20
quality almost the same design on one the price. For example, a sofa which
32:27
usually costs around £3,000 in a showroom in London. We will give it to
32:31
you for £300. As a drop shipping business, they're cutting out everything
32:36
in between. They pick the product, deliver it to the customer, cutting out
32:40
the middleman and the extra cost, cutting the cost by 90%. So that's where
32:46
they're adding value. They now have showroom, which wasn't
32:49
part of the original model. This was added to allow people to see the designs
32:53
firsthand, test them out, and choose fabrics. It is not only enough to create
32:58
a market, you then need to maintain it. Maid.com builds presence and brand
33:03
through the social media channels, loyalty, and affiliate programs.
33:08
Rather than hiring expensive buyers and assuming what people want, May
33:13
democratizes the design process to further strengthen customer.
33:17
Class, this is their strength. Back to you class. How many of you have brought
33:22
have bought furniture in your And can I have your experience of buying
33:31
like how do you buy furniture? Leather different colors and they
33:46
schedule taking it to your house and you have to having the guy who builds it.
33:51
Sometimes it doesn't fit, okay,
33:52
the door and you have to return it and they bring it
33:55
because you didn't measure the door. You measured the hall but you didn't measure
33:58
the door. Okay. Yes.
33:59
And the options are there. Yeah.
34:01
You you have the measurements, the options are there. Leather, you have
34:04
different colors and you choose. Anybody else? Your experience of buying
34:10
furniture. Anything. I saw some hands.
34:16
Same. Okay. Because because Okay.
34:20
Oh, they also have inside scratch leather when you have kids. That's
34:24
perfect. Okay.
34:33
So many options to choose from. So perfect. Ultimately class you have gone
34:39
and chosen what was available. Correct. for I'm matching your requirement with
34:44
color combination, measurement, shade, etc. They flipped it
34:50
because if you have to bring five sofas from China to London, display to
34:55
customers and customer wants a seventh shade.
35:00
They cut out all that. They democratized the process which means they left it to
35:05
customer. You tell what you want. Measurement, size, color, shade, you
35:10
tell us. we will get it for you. In this process, customer was empowered
35:17
and if any company asks me what do I want, I feel good and they're giving it
35:22
to me. I would love to go back to the same company. So this one flip by
35:28
empowering customers not only help them to build relationship but also cut costs
35:34
instead of assuming what customers want spending money on designers and
35:39
consultants. Customers are doing it and customers are engaged on social media
35:44
platforms through polls. Let's have a look at this interesting example and
35:48
we'll wind up this particular topic. Engagement. Furniture designs are posted
35:53
online and customers vote on the ones they want. Crowdsource designs go into
35:58
production and the people who voted receive a discount if they purchase one.
36:02
This helps gauge interest before they decide to build anything and it means
36:06
that they build what customers really need. Class crowd sourcing is one still
36:11
under utilized technique
36:18
very popular in the apps for maps where customers help
36:25
the app companies to actually correct whether the roads are clear road is
36:30
blocked but even for a furniture company crowdsourcing is good is what maid.com
36:36
showed in real business. It's a real business
36:40
based in London. For example, by letting the audience
36:44
choose the color for an existing sofa, they manage to triple sales. The revenue
36:49
model for maid.com is very simple. Yep, they make money by selling units of
36:54
furniture. To support this model, mate.com needs a great website platform
36:59
and people to coordinate the supply chain.
37:03
They focus on the key activities of linking beautiful designs, acquiring
37:07
customers through marketing and sales, posting them on the website for
37:11
customers to vote and choose on, then utilizing their partner network to
37:15
fulfill the orders. People pay up front, reducing inventory, waste, and risk.
37:21
Like it's controlling the supply chain, made.com can be extremely agile. Where
37:25
retailers typically release two collections per year, mate.com releases
37:30
two per week. Maid has strong partnerships working
37:34
with 45 designers and collaborators. They establish long-term relationships
37:38
and unlike many competitors offer great commissions and allow the designers to
37:43
retain the copyright. It's this virtuous cycle which means they get the best from
37:47
their design and manufacturing partners. The company minimizes overhead by
37:52
selling online, grouping orders, and cutting out the middlemen. The cost
37:57
savings are then passed on to the customer with furniture priced 70 to 85%
38:01
lower than its competitors. So the money is on the website platform, the people
38:06
to run the business. And one of the biggest costs is on marketing needed to
38:10
raise awareness. For example, the big billboard ads and the train stations.
38:15
They.com is a great example of how a good business model can disrupt a
38:18
traditional market. They have a quarter of a million customers and sell over
38:22
25,000 products per month and continue to grow rapidly. Okay,
38:27
class. For a startup, for a drop shipping startup, having quarter million
38:31
customers and 25,000 products is a big win. If you see this model,
38:37
they own nothing. This is Uber or Talabat of furniture.
38:45
The designs are owned by designers. The colors and all the options are given by
38:50
customers crowdsourced. The factories are in China.
38:56
These people have the rights to retain which means they will also sell it to
39:01
others. They don't mind. But these people are giving them high commissions.
39:04
So they'll come back to them. So neither the design are theirs, furniture is not
39:09
theirs, the ideas are not theirs, customers are giving ideas, designers
39:14
are finetuning them, factories are manufacturing, they are just
39:18
coordinating without owning asset except a showroom,
39:25
small showroom in London and a good website including an app. they have
39:31
managed to have quarter million customers and 25,000 products sold. This
39:36
is an impact of a drop shipping business.
39:39
You need to focus on a need and how can you add value to your customers. The
39:47
biggest value here is price. Price, affordability, reach, all these can be
39:52
value. You have to tell, you have to convince. But overall class a classic
39:57
example of how without owning any expertise or skill or asset this company
40:05
managed to have quarter million customers globally not only in London or
40:10
UK. So this is what I expect in your next
40:14
class. Next class as teams I want you to showcase your video. Take few seconds to
40:22
introduce because we don't know what your idea is. Anybody can do that and
40:26
the video should be played. Nine videos 20 marks for each team common marks. I
40:33
would I would not want to see any free riders. You all know this term.
40:42
Any guesses? People who take marks without doing
40:47
anything. No.
40:50
How should you contribute? That's your decision.
40:55
I am not micromanaging that. You are all adults here in the class. But you'll get
40:59
one mark. One person from the team must upload on LMS and the marks is for the
41:04
entire team. Yes, please. Sorry to keep you waiting.
41:07
Sorry. I just wanted to ask if we do something uh similar to this, is that
41:13
okay? Or you want us to be a little bit more creative with the
41:16
class? This is just an example. No, I'll tell you gentlemen. one discussion here
41:21
yeah here 2 minutes to 3 minutes is what I suggest because you have nine teams 2
41:28
to 3 minutes while time is not the major issue but don't give a 5 minute boring
41:34
video make it interesting make it exciting this is an example you want to
41:39
have like this fine you want to have a voice over like this fine you want to
41:43
act fine I have seen some wonderful videos last year I and I see some of the
41:49
acting skills, they can really target some movie industry as a as option B of
41:54
the career. Okay? You want to be the actors, you want to be the directors,
41:58
you want to be the editors, I leave it to you. Animated movies, cartoon movies,
42:04
I leave it to you. Just be careful about the rules and the practices and culture
42:10
of this region and country. That's it. Any other question class
42:16
regarding your assignment for next week? You
42:20
just have to do a business plan. Business model. Business plan is the
42:24
next assignment. I'll teach you business plan
42:26
question of how you make money. Ultimately class, what value? How much
42:32
money? What's your cost? Triangle. These are all adding
42:39
class this particular presentation and the next slide. Let me just show here
42:45
for your ease of understanding this particular presentation with the
42:55
video link will be uploaded after the class by the Tetar team. Also what I
43:00
have done this is part of the slide separately I've told Israel to upload a
43:05
word document this is giving you more details about each component.
43:13
Please don't turn your assignment into a boring question answer session. I'm not
43:18
expecting you all to answer those questions in the question answer format.
43:22
Use those questions for your guidance. It's a guide for you. What is expected
43:27
out of each block? I know some of you are not from business background yet for
43:32
them more details. So the video and this template will be on your LMS.
43:41
Any other question before I proceed to the next and the last part of today's
43:45
session and then I give you time. I want to see your ideas before we disperse
43:49
this evening. 20 marks one person upload the video.
43:57
how you want to structure the video, what should you do, who should be part
44:01
of that's your decision. But everybody should contribute, the contribution
44:05
could be in different ways that you decide as a team. I am not part of your
44:09
team. That's your team decision. Okay class. So these are further details for
44:16
you to have a look because many students requested more details. I've just made
44:20
it into a PPT form. The nine components of the business model canvas starts with
44:26
value proposition ends with money. The value you're adding ultimately should
44:32
result in you making money. So each of this question just taken out because the
44:37
font size of the template was very small. I've taken out this. We'll come
44:41
back to this after completing the last part of today. Then I'll give
44:48
you time to discuss your uh business uh model.
44:52
While we have talked about business idea generation, design thinking process,
44:58
business model, canvas development. Let us have a look last look. What if things
45:03
go wrong? How do you address the issue? Fivey analysis.
45:09
Before I go into this class, apply this fivey analysis in your life. All these
45:15
tools, right? apply them in your individual life to make yourself better
45:21
to develop yourself. 5Y is a problem-solving technique which means to
45:27
diagnose the past what has happened why it happened
45:33
also on the contrary I strongly suggest class apart from your curriculum five Y
45:40
for your future planning class five is not because it's my
45:45
favorite number it is just research proven and on five questions you will
45:49
come to the root cause 5 Y helps you to come to the root cause. Can I have a
45:54
volunteer now to just to talk to me about a problem?
46:00
Nothing. I'm not asking you a problem. Just just a volunteer
46:04
about so scary that you need to interrogate me
46:08
to you know just volunteer. He he raised first. Okay.
46:14
Okay. Why did you choose Teta? It aligned with my goals. Why do you
46:20
need align alignment? Because I uh what I wanted to do was
46:26
pretty similar to like exploring and doing business practically.
46:30
Why? Because I wanted to go into the business
46:33
field. Why?
46:36
I don't class. Are you understanding? This is
46:40
not for anybody else. Ask us. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much for
46:44
volunteering. Don't ask this to anybody. Don't tell this to anybody. Analyze
46:48
yourself. If you are confused about your future,
46:53
this 5Y is an excellent technique. I have applied this what all I'm I discuss
46:58
in class or share I do that first so that I am clear what I'm you know
47:03
preaching about in classrooms. So 5Y is an excellent researchp proven tool to
47:09
understand the problem past but my suggestion as a researcher apply this
47:14
for your future also by five wise if you don't find clarity there needs to be
47:21
some work done or change made are we clear let's have a look at a
47:26
simple summary of 5Y a simple example so that we understand it better before
47:32
moving to the second and the last tool for problem solving in organizations
47:38
especially in startups more than anything in the world
47:46
CRM. Yep. Well, Monday CRM it's the Hello and welcome to today's lesson
47:52
where we're looking at the five W's which is a technique that can help you
47:56
find the root cause of a problem. Now, it's a fact of life and business
48:01
that sometimes things go wrong. Software fails, equipment breaks, communication
48:06
is misunderstood, and the master plan you spent the last month putting
48:10
together falls apart after just 5 minutes. Now, to prevent these types of
48:16
problems from recurring, you usually need more than just a quick fix. So, the
48:22
five W's can be a useful tool in helping you to get to the root cause of what
48:26
went wrong. And by understanding the root cause of the problem, you can solve
48:30
it in such a way that it doesn't reoccur.
48:34
Now, the technique works by asking why five times to find the root cause of
48:38
your problem. And it was originally developed by Toyota in the 1930s.
48:44
So, let's take a look at an example. Suppose that your company's website is
48:50
down. Now, you obviously need to get the site back up and running ASAP. So,
48:55
that's just what you have to do. You can't just leave it there while you go
48:58
away to conduct your five Ws. You have to address that as a priority. But
49:04
immediately after the site is back up and running, you might then find it
49:08
useful to use the five Wise technique to ensure that all the causes of the
49:13
problem are addressed so that it doesn't happen again. So let's take a look at
49:18
what might have caused your website to go down. So why did the website go down?
49:23
Well, it ran out of memory. Why did it run out of memory? Well, because it was
49:28
incorrectly configured. And why was that? Well, because the site
49:33
administrator made a mistake. And why did they make that mistake? Well,
49:37
because development hadn't provided adequate instructions. And why was that?
49:42
Well, it was because they assumed it was obvious how to do the work. Now, in our
49:48
example, what appears at first to be a technical problem ends up being a human
49:53
problem. Someone made a mistake in this case the development team they made an
49:58
assumption that the work was obvious. Now okay class overall class what was
50:05
assumed in the beginning 5y will help you to go to the root cause of the
50:10
problem this was showcased by Toyota built by Toyota and
50:17
it is used in the automobile industry however used across industries. One more
50:23
real example is from the aviation world. I don't know how many of you have come
50:27
across in videos or in real life when people talk they respond by copy that or
50:35
Roger that. Have you heard this pilots etc. This was not there before.
50:42
This came after a crash of two airplanes when one flight was landing other was
50:47
taking off. The worst time for a crash is this time because landing or takeoff
50:53
you're high speeds especially takeoff. The problem was the pilot asked the
50:59
question if they can land and the response was silence.
51:04
Now since we come from different countries and cultures what does silence
51:08
mean to you? There's no
51:12
is it yes or no? Not depends on the question.
51:18
If there's no answer then what does silence mean to you is the
51:21
question. Is it yes or no?
51:28
Neither. Neither.
51:31
Neither. How many of you Yes.
51:36
Okay. Depends on question. I heard some nos like is silence yes or no?
51:42
No. Yes. Depends.
51:46
Thank you. That is what the problem at ATC was. ATC is air traffic controller
51:52
silence. Now aviation industry is one of the most diverse industry employees from
51:58
all over the world. So what means silence for one culture
52:03
might be the exact opposite for other culture. So when a question is asked by
52:08
a person from one culture one one discussion ladies here one minute one
52:11
minute here let let me let one person talk. So when a pilot asked can I land
52:17
silence was assumed to be no but pilot didn't get a no if I don't get
52:24
a no it is yes pilot was right in his assumption so after the crash which
52:32
unfortunately led to many deaths it is a mandatory aviation rule and across
52:38
military and air forces you need to respond can I and copy that,
52:44
Roger that. No, copy that or Roger that. And he takes you for a sightseeing for
52:50
10 minutes of the city or the country. Now this is where fivey why did the
52:56
crash happened? They applied fivey most of my course is already reality. We are
53:03
just going back stepping one step backwards to understand the connect
53:07
between theory and reality. Is 5i clear class? 5Y is a diagnostic tool which
53:14
allows you to go to the root cause of a problem and indepth analyze what was
53:20
exactly the issue. Moving ahead
53:26
fishbone analysis is the second and the last part for today again from Japanese.
53:32
So these two class Japanese have been in the automobile industry and have been
53:38
market leaders. They have they have built many frameworks and this helps
53:43
most of the sectors not only automobile or manufacturing but all across
53:47
different sectors. Ishiawa or fishbone analysis is used as a cause effect
53:55
framework. What is the cause? What is the effect of
54:00
a particular issue? It helps to categorize an issue into different
54:06
compartments like a fishbone class. Literally a fishbone this
54:10
irrespective of your dietary preferences. I'm sure some of you prefer
54:16
seafood and you would have come across a fishbone in your palette. This is taken
54:22
from a fishbone literally. So the problem is the head and the bones are
54:28
the categories. What could be the categories of the cause which resulted
54:34
in this problem the effect? Let us have a look a small video on fishbone
54:40
analysis before I leave you all to discuss in teams.
54:50
Imagine being able to build anything just by thinking about it. Leap base 44,
54:56
a complete AI creation platform. A fishbone diagram, also known as a
55:03
cause and effect diagram, is a way to visualize cause named for its
55:07
resemblance to a fish skeleton. It's useful for product development in
55:11
troubleshooting processes as it identifies causes of a problem instead
55:15
of merely treating the symptoms. To create fishbone diagrams, list the
55:20
problem in a box, aka the fish head. The backbone is a horizontal arrow pointing
55:26
to the head. At least four overarching causes of the problem branch off from
55:31
the spine with arrows, making the first fish bones. Causes can include methods,
55:36
equipment, people, or even environmental factors. For each overarching cause,
55:41
note contributing factors that branch off from their corresponding cause and
55:46
continue the branching off process until a root cause for the problem is found. A
55:50
fishbone diagram is helpful for finding potential causes to a problem as well as
55:55
revealing areas of weakness in a business process and ensuring corrective
55:59
actions are put in place to resolve any future issues.
56:08
Class in brief fishburn analysis is a horizontal
56:14
framework as you see here. It helps you to compartmentalize or categorize the
56:19
causes or types of causes for one particular problem. On the other hand,
56:25
5y helps you to go in depth to find out the root cause of the problem. Now, our
56:32
duty is to understand both the frameworks. While both have their own
56:36
pros and cons, one individual activity class, this is not for me or for
56:41
curriculum, for yourself. when you as an individual
56:46
when you did not meet a goal apply 5y so that you don't repeat the
56:52
mistake again this will be uploaded I repeat this is for you just to self
56:58
assess yourself or your particular timeline till now think of something
57:03
which you had planned to do but you could not you could not is not important
57:09
why you could not is important so that in future you don't repeat the same
57:14
pattern. 5y is more applicable for us as
57:19
individuals and not only for companies or organizations. To sum up, every
57:25
framework has its own pros and cons class. This is the final summary of the
57:30
frameworks. We have two frameworks. In fact, there are many more. Two key 5Y
57:36
and fishbone. My suggestion is as business people, as entrepreneurs, apply
57:40
both. While 5y gives you the root cause, fishbone will allow you to have a
57:47
divergent approach. So you are going in breadth and in depth
57:53
cause and effect here potential causes but there are too many so you might get
57:58
confused. So better is to integrate in depth surfacial
58:04
might not help us in identifying complex issues. More importantly, it is based on
58:10
opinion of others because others will give. Here it is your own analysis.
58:16
To sum up my suggestion as a consultant and as a researcher, integrate these
58:22
two. You will face many problems in your project, in your future assignments and
58:27
your initiatives to start a business. And when you face a roadblock, don't
58:33
just give up or change. Understand why it happened. People quickly shift,
58:39
change the gears or change the course. Fine, that is required. But why it
58:44
happened? Why did you face an issue? That particular issue you should be
58:48
clear. Not what? Forget what happened. Forgive the
58:53
person. Be more generous. But remember the lesson. And the lesson is by
58:58
applying these two. The lesson is why it happened should not be forgotten. So
59:03
this is for today class. The whole idea was to share you about the business
59:07
model canvas and two frameworks to understand any problems you face. Next
59:13
15 minutes I would like to see what exactly is your business from the lens
59:19
of business model canvas. I want to see the first block filled and
59:25
shared with me. What exactly are you doing with your drop shipping business?
59:29
What value are you adding? quickly as teams discuss I want you all to write
59:40
question yes please
59:42
so I'm beginning a project in Colombia and it's like about a an AI agency but I
59:49
remember at the beginning of the club you said to segment the the market
59:52
because it was too difficult as a project which is beginning to get the
59:56
whole market but then for example I want to approach to I wanted approach to the
1:00:02
whole Colombia as a country but I think it's too big the market so you recommend
1:00:07
me to start start from a city
1:00:09
from a city your own city
1:00:11
and also not only the city but also the the kind of businesses there are
1:00:16
industries like dentist healthcare uh consulting focus focus one by one by one
1:00:22
one by one you become an expert for example talabat started with food
1:00:27
now grocery so you have scope of diversification But first who are your
1:00:33
mains customers and what value? Okay.
1:00:36
If they see this next dentist, next carpenters, next maids.
1:00:41
So you would recommend me to be as a specific not only the country but the
1:00:45
city and the industry. Who are you? If you're everybody, you're
1:00:49
not you're nobody. Okay.
1:00:51
One master it one by one. If dentist don't work, I go
1:00:55
to spas or barers. Make them work. See Apple.
1:00:59
Yeah. made the computers work then music players then nanopods then
1:01:06
iPhone now an ecosystem you had to you be the
1:01:10
apple of the services okay
1:01:12
for that you need to be master one
1:01:15
one thing then people should tell no he provided
1:01:18
us with best dentist then next carpenters
1:01:21
okay don't apply for all nobody will come
1:01:25
be an expert in one by one and be an expert
1:01:28
thank you teacher Huh?
1:01:30
Class, a good question here. One minute.
1:01:34
Gentlemen, class. Can I have attention please?
1:01:39
Yes. A question from one person will help us
1:01:41
to understand your own business better guys.
1:01:44
One. Okay. Captain,
1:01:47
one by one. Don't try to be master of all industries and do service to all
1:01:56
customers. Doesn't work. My favorite example again is Apple. Not because you
1:02:02
know I don't use it but from business example. They made innovative computers.
1:02:08
They got into the market with computers. Then came laptops. Then came music
1:02:15
players. Then they disrupted music industry. Then they entered phones. Step
1:02:20
by step. One of you mentioned ecosystem. I think that was the answer.
1:02:24
Ecosystem should be the end. not the start. If you start, you'll be
1:02:30
nobody. You'll be master of none, jack of none.
1:02:34
You will be out of business. Jack of
1:02:37
master of one, master of second, master of third. Step by step. Look at the
1:02:43
delivery companies. We deliver food. Now we'll deliver groceries. Now we'll
1:02:48
deliver medicines. Now we will deliver other things. Step by step.
1:02:52
Deliver me also. Yes. Yes. That's a big Yeah. In
1:02:55
Bangalore 10 minutes away in class in Dubai. In Dubai,
1:03:00
in Dubai they deliver drivers. Late night you're partying. You don't want to
1:03:05
drive back. 10 minutes driver.
1:03:08
People just get over 10 minutes. No, no, no. Not taxi. A driver to drive
1:03:12
your car. Not taxi to your car. You want to take a
1:03:16
car? No. Okay. Clear.
1:03:38
Do we ever submit this today or like everything?
1:03:40
I want to know your business idea today. Done.
1:03:47
So we just have to tell you value proposition, right? And who are your
1:03:51
customers too? Yeah. Yeah, we have both.
1:03:53
Yeah. We're doing first value proposition. So basically to explain, we
1:03:58
are doing the doing it as of an agency based service to provide
1:04:03
service for customized gifting for companies. So we figure out that for
1:04:08
companies they want to make a free work on kids. It's really hard to contact
1:04:14
suppliers because they don't answer. They delay a lot. Then it's bad quality.
1:04:19
and you have to contact with 10 20 suppliers to get one. So what we do is
1:04:23
just doing the work for them. For example, you're a company, you want to
1:04:27
deliver let's say Yeah. with your customization
1:04:33
and you come to us and you say I want this kind of bag with this.
1:04:37
Fair enough. Who are your target customers?
1:04:40
who companies are here which like specific clients first of all not
1:04:44
the Taiwan Tai companies like startups people who are just starting out people
1:04:48
who are at events like like Jite companies who are like out there at
1:04:52
events doing events who need like merchandise products so we
1:04:57
so basically startups startups and small and medium because established
1:05:01
businesses have their own inhouse
1:05:06
but what my suggestion is be more specific Okay.
1:05:09
Yeah. Yeah. We can go into specific specific and be a master of that. Then
1:05:14
you have your plan for a grand you know maybe a very more comprehensive approach
1:05:19
but start with a specific one. Okay. More specificity and in 2 minutes
1:05:23
the entire canvas should be covered. Okay. Good. This is which team
1:05:30
this is. Hello. This is our product.
1:05:32
That's your product already. Okay. So like video spheres which you can have
1:05:36
and put in your videos. This is the wedding
1:05:40
gifting gifting seasonal. Who are your customers? B2C or B2B?
1:05:47
CC. Why should I buy? And
1:05:51
it's one it's home accessories like for you to like you know like keep it in
1:05:56
your home and also gifting and cuz it's Christmas new year you can have memories
1:06:03
or like maybe not directly you but you can buy this for your children
1:06:08
or or companies can buy for corporate gifting.
1:06:10
So what I suggest is start with B2B first
1:06:14
corporate gifting. Yeah. And then come to B2C.
1:06:17
We had an idea to do like This was one of our contacts for wedding like gifts.
1:06:24
Correct. B2B event management companies, schools because memories of kids,
1:06:30
schools have lot of photo. Exactly. Graduation ceremony. That's a big
1:06:33
business if you have how can we
1:06:36
I not buy catch of universities. Graduation ceremony four years memories
1:06:42
in one. So my suggestion work it out. I'm not in
1:06:46
your team. B2B is better to start with. How do you think we can um as a drop
1:06:51
shipping business person like a B2B offer to those
1:06:56
like how can we reach them and like what kind of proposal that we
1:07:01
answer that's the next question channels that's your task are you clear are you
1:07:05
all one team okay so B2B is what I suggest
1:07:09
channels yes class
1:07:14
same same idea
1:07:16
question yeah the same oh that question Okay.
1:07:18
But the the question is the third I don't know what bundles of products and
1:07:22
services are we offering to each customer segment. I don't know what that
1:07:25
question means. So you your bundle know you you dentist
1:07:30
carpentry and all that that's a bundle. So maybe if I'm already a customer if I
1:07:34
am taking you know service of maids or
1:07:38
dentist also I'll go offer 20% off bundle offer.
1:07:42
Okay. If you take one and take second one 20%
1:07:45
off. Okay. If you buy one
1:07:48
bundles of, you know, in Tim Hortons, buy a hot chocolate, buy a sandwich,
1:07:52
combo offer, 20% off. Okay, I understand.
1:07:57
Go ahead. Yes, please.
1:08:00
Still. Yes.
1:08:01
Ready. Who is your customer base and what's
1:08:05
your value? That's all. Then you can build.
1:08:09
We're doing the full. Okay. Okay. Full for next week. But right now,
1:08:20
Okay. The who our customer is um the it's people who want to display uh live
1:08:27
videos or more photos than they actually have space for and then they can use our
1:08:32
product to display multiple photos um and videos at the same time and those
1:08:38
videos can actually play. So you have a much better memory of um much better
1:08:44
display of your photos and videos and your memories than when you add an
1:08:47
actual uh photo frame. But we already have what value are you
1:08:52
adding? We already have so many on Amazon similar products.
1:08:56
No, no, we're not adding it. Okay.
1:08:59
I feel like the audience could be like people are astonished like that they
1:09:04
they only just want it. So is this business B2B or
1:09:11
B2C? B2C too many compet
1:09:19
okay but but like just understand at the end like our customer base it's so broad
1:09:24
it's a little tough to like to I know of course you can segment
1:09:28
so so try to segment it target one by one
1:09:32
I would suggest B2B why yes why
1:09:37
because you can target thousands of customers or hundreds of customers
1:09:41
within one transaction. For example, you tie up with a event management company
1:09:45
or a wedding management company. They want to give written gifts to the guests
1:09:50
who have come. The return gift is the photos of the entire wedding. Take it
1:09:54
and watch whenever you are free. So it could be universities, companies.
1:10:01
Yeah. But do you want to do show me one to have an idea? So B2B
1:10:07
would be better because you can target the wedding.
1:10:14
So men and women 20 to 50, but they're doing the same thing.
1:10:22
Yeah, exactly. Change your idea. Same would not add
1:10:29
value. Huh? They're doing the same thing that team
1:10:36
at least have at least have a different market. Competition is fine. Have a
1:10:41
different geographical market where you're targeting.
1:10:45
So if the same product, similar offering at least change the geographical context
1:10:50
you target. Which country are you from? I'm from Brazil.
1:10:54
United States. Uh Canada.
1:10:58
That's so diverse. You got three countries.
1:11:01
Okay, fine. Fine. Target on your countries first.
1:11:05
But the thing is that it's drop shipping. So
1:11:08
you can add value of course, but you can plus value always is not about
1:11:14
you know product or service. It's about the process also.
1:11:18
It's about the experience also. It's about the offerings you have.
1:11:22
No, I mean just for like it's a problem. I understood like oh just different on
1:11:28
your customers. But like let's say we have a similar base because that's
1:11:32
probably what's going to happen is like do you actually see this as a
1:11:37
problem like if we get a better marketing team we do better campaigns at
1:11:42
the end we can like at the end we're enhancing our
1:11:47
I'll tell you I'll tell you how we can differentiate geographically okay
1:11:51
societies are different now this is most about nostalgia memories
1:11:56
Nuclear families would like this more because nuclear families live on
1:12:00
nostalgia. Joint families have less time. There are
1:12:05
too many people in the house. They don't have time for memories. They don't have
1:12:09
time for the daily activities. So your target geographical societies should be
1:12:15
nuclear families oriented which is western
1:12:18
to start with then expand. So same product world is big enough. 10 people
1:12:26
can have the same product and still make money. This is the water. Okay. You walk
1:12:30
into any supermarket, you have 10 10 to 12 companies all are making money.
1:12:35
Yeah. So you should be clear which
1:12:37
geographical context how are you approaching and what ultimately is
1:12:42
making you money. Yeah. We were we were going to do like
1:12:45
targeting like families. Perfect. Answer these questions in a
1:12:49
video form. Two to three minutes video. It's really interesting what you said
1:12:52
because she tried some different video formats on Instagram and photos with
1:12:58
babies of babies and cats in like in the mall in the square got way more
1:13:05
interaction than uh Halloween. Yeah, we've been targeting different
1:13:10
like parts and we're seeing which ones are working.
1:13:14
So now translate all these into a business model.
1:13:17
Okay, next week I would like to see a good video. Okay.
1:13:20
Thank you. Yes. Good morning.
1:13:25
Good morning. Good afternoon. Okay.
1:13:30
Good morning. What's your business and what value are you adding?
1:13:34
So, essentially our business is like recording classes
1:13:38
and our value proposition is you can record in 4K. It's all hands. We have AI
1:13:43
translation and direction on the spot. Who are your target customers?
1:13:49
customers essentially influences. Why?
1:13:53
Because right now videos are going up and people would like to record more
1:13:57
handsfree. Okay. While they are actually
1:14:00
experiencing that they want to show it to their followers.
1:14:03
Fair enough. Apply the whole thing. Idea is good but in a model form. How will
1:14:10
this idea make money for you and for me if I have to invest?
1:14:14
Treat me as an investor. 20 marks equal to 20 million dirhams. Take it. Okay.
1:14:19
Clear. Go ahead. So that's not today.
1:14:22
Yes, there is. There is. There is. There is. There is
1:14:25
class. Anybody else? You are one team.
1:14:30

Old people that are old and old. Okay. Idea is clear. You know, you know
1:14:54
your target customers. Yes sir.
1:14:56
Now build a model out of it to showcase that you're making money and you'll help
1:15:01
us to make money as investors. That should be your business model in
1:15:06
two to three minutes in a video form.

1:15:44
Because it it's a nostalgic feel which the vine be gives and we are selling it
1:15:49
with a modern twist like it's also for the people who like home decoration will
1:15:54
look good in their room. So this is
1:16:03
even for listening and even for gifting B2C directly.
1:16:06
Exactly. B2C is a B2C is a better option because
1:16:11
here it is individual based idea transit that into a model now ultimately how
1:16:17
will you make money and as an investor how will I make
1:16:23
okay that is your revenue and cost how much will it cost you how much will you
1:16:28
make money and how much will I make money if I invest in your business that
1:16:31
should be in a video form what do you think who should we target
1:16:34
B2C is fine but within B2C which particular geographic context text.
1:16:39
Yeah, that should be more clear.
1:16:40
Okay, do some research about it. Okay,
1:16:43
