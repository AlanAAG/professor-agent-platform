The Power of Averages: Making Smarter Business Decisions with CLT & LLN‚Äù
16/10/2025 | 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
Mrs. Shivangi Rajora
0:01
So what was variability? What was what measures did we discuss
0:07
for variability? The spread of the numbers,
0:17
the range. So we had a few measures of variability,
0:21
right? Which were I'll change it.
0:26
um range then standard deviation
0:32
standard deviation variance
0:38
IQR anybody has any doubt as to the purpose
0:43
they serve what are they telling us yes
0:52
okay Okay, sorry.
1:00
They allow you to understand the variability in the spread of your data.
1:07
Okay, you have to pay attention now when I'm saying again.
1:11
Using these measures, we tried to understand how the data was spread out.
1:18
Right? So in the first two classes we discussed central tendency
1:28
which was what it was a point around which your data
1:33
was spread right mean median mode
1:38
we had arrived at a singular point around which your data was spread right
1:44
they were calculated differently they had different purposes right I'm not
1:48
going to cover that again. Go back to the recordings if you need to. But we
1:54
realize the central point is not enough to understand the data.
1:59
Right? And therefore we need to understand about the central point. How
2:04
does my data vary? Right? How far away is my data from the
2:11
central point? And therefore we had the measures of variability. We talked about
2:17
range which were maximum and minima values. We talked about standard
2:22
deviation. What what how was standard deviation calculated?
2:30
Sorry. Well, Excel. Yes.
2:33
You remember this divide by
2:46
For the n for the s n minus one for sample
2:53
if it was population it would just be n
2:58
was what? Number of data points.
3:02
n was the number of data points. Clear? Right. Variance.
3:10
What was variance? Standard deviation squared. standard
3:13
deviation squared, right? Variance was simply standard deviation
3:20
squared, right? IQR interal range.
3:28
Yes. Q3 minus Q1. How did we arrive at Q3 and
3:34
Q1? Right? 25. We divided our data the
3:40
spread of our data into four quarters right and the positions at which the 25
3:47
first 25% ended and the last 25% began gave us the values Q3 and Q1
3:56
right and that helped us calculate where did the middle 50% of our data lie
4:05
right so now we have essential points defining our data and we know how data
4:13
is spread about that point. Yes.
4:21
IQR I IQR interile range. Thank you.
4:27
Okay. Right. So we have a central point and we
4:33
have some idea as to how data is spread around that central point. Right?
4:42
Now say for example I give you two numbers guys please I give you two
4:49
numbers. Say the mean is mean age for my customers
4:55
is 25 and standard deviation is 3 years.
5:02
What does this mean? What does this mean? If I say that the
5:08
mean age or average age of my customer is 25 years and the standard deviation
5:14
is 3 years to
5:18
20 to 28. Right? Your the customer the ages of your customers are spread about
5:25
25 but most of the data most of the ages
5:29
are from 25 to 28 or from 22 to so essentially majority of your data is
5:39
going to lie about in this range. Got it? Right.
5:45
Now does that mean that you will not have a customer who is 21 years of age?
5:54
Sorry. It's
5:58
for this range. Yes, it seems like an outlier but does that mean it will never
6:04
happen? It will happen. Right? Remember that
6:08
example from uh from mega mart sales right? we have discussed for
6:14
understanding median and the difference between median and mean. So there were
6:19
on one day somebody bought $500 worth of goods and on the same day somebody
6:25
bought $55 worth of goods, right? And this day,
6:32
right, we had another day which had $197 worth of goods being sold on an average
6:38
to all customers. Right? Just because the mean was 197 and
6:44
we would have calculated the median also. I think the median came about $20
6:49
or something, right? Does not mean that this extreme
6:54
events would not have happened, right?
7:00
If you have say for example a supplier with shipping time 4 days and the
7:05
standard deviation of shipping times as 1 day, does it mean that never ever will
7:12
they delay your shipment by 10 days? Never.
7:18
They can. They can.
7:21
Sometimes it can happen. There is never say never sort of a
7:26
thing, right? Are we comfortable with this?
7:31
Are we comfortable with 10 days of certain day?
7:36
What are you comfortable with? I am glad that you're comfortable in the
7:43
concept and not comfortable with the fact that your supplier is uh delaying
7:47
the shipping by 10 days. So you're not comfortable with the supplier delaying
7:52
your shipment by 10 days. You're not comfortable this with this one person
7:56
who's buying $500 worth of groceries on a day when your mean was just $200.
8:02
Right? Which means right now you are curious to know what are the chances of
8:09
these outliers happening. Yes.
8:18
It's more profit. Correct. Right. Please.
8:23
Yes. The reason you're not comfortable with
8:30
somebody buying $500 worth of groceries on a single day is because you have only
8:35
anticipated people buying on an average $200 worth of groceries.
8:41
Right? The reason you're not comfortable with somebody 21 years of uh age uh you
8:48
know falling in your as your customer coming out as your customer because you
8:52
have only prepared for this right which means these outliers are not
8:59
comfortable for us. We want to know right what was the objective of
9:03
variability? The objective of understanding
9:07
variability in data was to reduce our risk,
9:14
right? We wanted to know as much about the data as possible and variability
9:20
helped us to some extent, right? But it does not explain it does
9:26
not help us understand everything about the data. Even if you know the standard
9:31
deviation, somebody somebody in your customer pool
9:35
could be falling outside that standard deviation range.
9:40
Right? Even even if you know the standard deviation of supply lines,
9:45
sometimes your supply could fall, your supply time could increase by much
9:50
larger than what you had expected, right? And therefore
9:56
now you are really really curious to understand what are the chances of these
10:04
outliers happening. What are the chances that somebody
10:09
outside your standard deviation age come uh tries to buy your product online?
10:17
Some sorry unlikely. Unlikely but does it never happen?
10:24
Right? You still want to So remember um
10:30
we have some information, right? Mean gave us some information,
10:34
standard deviation gave us some information and they prepared us for
10:40
major chunk of what was happening either in terms of ages, either in terms of
10:45
sales per person, either in terms of shipping depths, right?
10:53
It's okay. It's okay. But it does not prepare us for all of
11:05
the times events which could happen but are not covered by mean or the standard
11:12
deviation. Right? You could still have events
11:17
happening outside of this range. range provided to you by the standard
11:23
deviation or IQR right and you still want to prepare for
11:28
that right you want to take I mean come on just think of it by the way if you
11:32
remember I told you if you have the standard deviation technically about 70%
11:37
of your data lies in this bracket right so mean plus minus
11:45
standard deviation is almost 70% of the data
11:50
30% is still a very large chunk for you to not care about.
11:57
Do you think you would run a business successfully by not caring about the
12:00
remaining 30%. Not really.
12:04
Right. So the so which means one we're curious about outliers. Agreed.
12:12
Right. Anybody who thinks that they can get away with not caring about
12:28
so we care about our Okay. Now let's go back inside this
12:42
bracket of mean plus minus standard deviation.
12:46
Our 70% of the data occurs here. Right? If it was say customer ages, 70% of your
12:55
customers are lying in this age bracket. If the shipping time 70% of the times
13:02
your supplier will ship with a certainty that okay fine my shipping time will be
13:07
from 3 to 6 days with some maybe 4.5 70% of the times
13:15
but other than this information that 70% of the times my data will lie here do I
13:22
actually know that in that 70% of the time what is the exact number number of
13:28
times that they will deliver in 4.5 days. What is the exact number of time
13:34
that they will deliver in 3.5 days or what is the exact number of times that
13:39
they will deliver in 4 days I also want to know that why
13:49
to prevent any kind of vulnerability right to contain my risk to be very sure
13:56
right how well I can deliver to my customers or how well I can target my
14:01
ads to the customers, right? So, not just that I'm curious
14:05
about what happens with outliers, I am also curious what the spread of data in
14:12
this range looks like, right? I still care about that.
14:21
So, I need to now know two things. What the outliers are doing. What my 70% of
14:29
the data what does it look like? What are the chances that if you have a
14:37
range of customers from 22 to 28, how many of them are going to be 26
14:43
years of age, right? Because definitely the way you
14:48
target 23 year olds might be a little different from targeting 26 years, 26
14:55
year olds, right? The way you promise shipping,
14:59
right? On your website, you will promise shipping that our product will ship in
15:04
like 3 to 5 days and will be delivered to you in less than 2 weeks.
15:09
Right? You need to be sure that what is happening within that 70% of the data
15:16
points. Agreed?
15:21
This brings us to the idea of probability.
15:26
What are the chances of something happening?
15:32
Okay, because we have some data. We have some data as to that some data told us
15:40
the mean that some data told us the standard deviation
15:45
right but we want to be even more specific about the information we can
15:50
get from that data which means that from that some data we are now going to try
15:56
to find out the chances of very specific events occurring.
16:03
All right, given that my mean age of customer was 25 and the standard
16:07
deviation was three, what are the chances that
16:12
um 10% of my customers are going to be over 25 years of age?
16:20
Given that my mean supply time is 4 days,
16:25
what are the chances that 50% of the times the supply would happen before 4
16:32
days? Right? Supply means the supplier will actually ship
16:40
below the below the mean. Right?
16:45
Do you now understand why we will go into probability?
16:51
Yeah. Questions.
17:01
Same goes for sampling by the way. Okay. Say for example,
17:07
you have you have taken out a pilot survey, right? You've conducted a pilot
17:11
survey for your customers and some of them have said that they like your
17:16
product. in that service some others said they did not like your product. So
17:20
let's assume the proportion was 60/40. Now given the information that in this
17:27
class 60% of the people like my product I want to know what is what are the
17:33
chances that if I sold to section two 40% of the people there will buy my
17:41
product given that I have this information what
17:46
are the chances that that materializes we have some information and we are
17:52
using that information to make educated guesses about some other events
17:58
happening. Okay.
18:01
So, how many of you have had some sort of an introduction to probability?
18:08
How did we study probability? Sorry.
18:17
Three diagrams. Okay. So,
18:29
Cards, dice, please. Coins.
18:42
Yes. Real life movie uses.
18:47
Yeah, we'll do that. That's the objective.
18:51
Yeah, business examples. We'll do all of that.
18:56
Of course, by the way, I have that's what I've been talking about,
19:03
right? So, very basic example. First question,
19:09
you can see this, right? There's green balls and orange balls.
19:14
If I told you, if I told you, if I asked you to draw one ball out of this, one
19:20
ball out of this bucket, what is the probability that it is going to be
19:23
green? 6 out of 15,
19:34
right? Probability of green ball, right? Do we understand? Probability is
19:41
simply favorable outcomes upon total outcomes.
19:54
Okay. If I told you to draw two balls out of this bucket,
20:00
what is the probability that both of them will be green?
20:08
So why did you say 5? Yeah.
20:16
Very good. Right. It depends whether I put the ball back or not. So if when you
20:22
said 5 by 14, you made the assumption that I did not pull the put the first
20:28
ball back into the bucket. You can do that right. I have not made
20:36
that clear to you right now whether I'm asking you to pull up draw two balls
20:41
together or I'm asking you to draw two balls one after the other and then also
20:46
I could tell you either put the ball first ball back or don't put put the
20:50
first ball back. In both situations the probability of drawing green balls is
20:56
going to be different. Is anybody clear on that? Any
21:03
questions, doubts? No. Fine.
21:08
Okay. If I from this bucket
21:13
asked you that I want to draw one green ball and one orange ball,
21:18
what is the probability of that? One green ball and one orange ball. We
21:27
have to use what is permutation.
21:31
Okay. Can you can you explain what that is?
21:37
Sorry. combination combination.
21:50
Uh why why are you saying combination combination?
21:54
There are two different number of outputs.
21:56
What are the two different outputs? One means
22:05
the number of outcomes divided by number of outcomes.
22:10
That's always okay. Now
22:19
technically you're right and there is some scope of improvement in the
22:24
probabilities that you have told me for drawing out one green and one orange
22:29
ball. Yes.
22:40
So which means that one order matters. Two you need to know whether I put the
22:47
ball back or not. Right? Or matters is clear to everyone that technically me
22:54
drawing first ball I drew is green and the second ball I draw is orange. And
23:01
then I do uh another repeat the experiment again and I draw first orange
23:06
and then green. These are two different events,
23:11
right? These are two different events. To understand it better, say for example
23:18
you are interested in credit card histories of three people,
23:23
right? say Shivangi, Gha and
23:30
right. So consider those two walls as
23:34
independent. Right? Which means that if I was to ask
23:39
that two out of these three people will default this month.
23:44
What are the chances of that happening? 534
23:53
default like they don't pay their credit card
23:56
bill. What are the chances that two out of
24:07
these three people will not pay their credit card bill this month?
24:14
Good question, right? I don't know what are the chances of one person not
24:19
paying. So first I need that information. Right? So I have calculated
24:24
I've done the credit history of you know work with the credit history of all
24:28
three and I've arrived at the conclusion that for each of them there is a 20%
24:34
chance that they failed. For each of them means
24:39
if you looked at me individually there's a 20% chance that I don't pay back my
24:43
credit card bill. If you looked at individually, 20% chance he will not pay
24:48
back the credit card bill. You looked at Karma, 20% chance he will not pay back.
24:54
What are the chances that any two of us will not pay back our credit card bills?
25:10
SGB and SPG
25:17
SV. Okay.
25:24
Why does order not matter? Is meing but is me defaulting or bes defaulting
25:36
the same event? No, no, not you and not really
25:41
but the odds of both of you like there's no there's no who defaults
25:47
first. No if you define
26:06
20 * 20 * 3. Yeah. Plus
26:12
it's easier to say plus all. So it's 2020 plus 2020 + 20. Okay. All of the
26:17
discussion that is happening here. Uh who are not following at all? If some
26:23
people are sleeping, um I I can see that that's okay. Not
26:27
following. Okay. Not following. Anybody else not
26:31
following at all? What's happened? Fine. So the first thing we do here is
26:39
list out all of the possibilities that could happen. Right?
26:45
So first possibility all of us pay right? Second possibility
26:55
none of us pay right we have six more possibilities.
27:01
Can somebody help me? Okay.
27:11
cross. Uh
27:15
stick cross take cross
27:22
take sorry cross tick cross and take cross tick. How many? 3 4 5 6 7 8
27:32
Any other possibility? Any other possibility?
27:38
Cross cross one tick tick tick done x right
27:50
all possibilities are listed out in how many of these possibilities
27:56
only two people exactly two people default
28:00
three possibilities so 1 2
28:10
and three. So number of favorable outcomes search
28:17
the one who is not following. What did I do?
28:26
Mhm. The most favorable outcomes.
28:28
Why? What are the favorable outcomes? Why are they favorable?
28:36
This is the only What was my question?
28:45
What are the cases when only two people fail to pay?
28:51
Out of all of these, right? I have a list here of all of the possibilities
28:57
that could happen of which I have defined for myself that I want to know
29:03
what is the possibility that two people will fail. So my favorable outcomes are
29:08
consists of outcomes where two people are failing to pay.
29:15
Favorable outcomes three
29:20
unfavorable total number of outcomes eight. Is that how it works? So what
29:27
what do I do this with 3x8? How how do I actually calculate the
29:34
probability? You have given you probability of one person failing.
29:40
How do I Yes. So now we know 20% we know three. So if
29:46
it's 2% 1 by 5 1 so 5 1 by 5. Okay.
29:58
So when I'm talking about three events
30:02
happening together, right? What I'm essentially doing is I'm
30:09
going to multiply their probability, right? So when two events happen
30:14
together, right? Say for example, if you tossed a coin and you want to toss a
30:19
coin twice, you want to calculate the probability of two heads occurring.
30:23
Technically, the probability is 1x2 * 1x2
30:29
Right. Similarly, now I have these three outcomes which I want to calculate the
30:35
probability of. For my first outcome, what is the probability of Shivangi
30:41
failing? 2 probability of GMA failing
30:48
2 probability of making the payment.8 date. So the probability of this event
30:57
particular this particular event happening that shamani and fail and
31:02
makes the payment on time is2 into 2 into8
31:09
right but that is not the only event I'm interested in it could also happen that
31:14
shamani and faith right which means now I have two events
31:22
that could happen right two different events that I'm
31:27
interested in because they have a different order which means now I add
31:32
the probability of Shivangi failing GMA making the payment and failing
31:43
plus we add all the possibilities
31:46
we add all of the possibilities yes every time you say the word and you
31:51
should multiply every time you say the or you just
31:54
correct right?
31:57
So a very good short hand for remembering when to multiply
32:00
probabilities and when to add them is if you want to see two events happening
32:06
together right this and this happening you multiply the probabilities
32:13
right but I am interested in seeing could this happen or this happen
32:19
right in that case I add the probabilities
32:27
Sorry like in this case it's the same like
32:31
different order. Yeah.
32:36
Yeah. I'm just trying to visualize. Right. So technically yes this into
32:40
three right but but be clear the reason it
32:47
it's it's multiplied by three is because these are all different events.
32:55
Right? Which means now technically all right.
32:59
So I have done all of this mumbo jumbo. All right. If I was a person interested
33:06
in understanding the payback capacities of the clients,
33:13
right? I say suppose I work in SMT or movies,
33:19
right? And I am rating the mortgage back securities.
33:24
What are mortgage back securities? Nobody's nobody's watch that um make
33:32
sure our mortgage security is the capability
33:37
to pay back the mortgage. It's a it's a financial instrument. Yes.
33:44
So whe
34:12
right so basically Guys, guys, guys, just a small
34:18
uh segue to uh the markets of financial institutions.
34:24
When a bank gives you a loan, it's usually against something. It's a
34:28
collateral, right? When people use take loans to buy houses, they essentially
34:35
get a mortgage against the house, right? Right. you you take a loan
34:42
against your house. Now what financial institutions then do is right say banks
34:48
because banks really want to keep making money right and now the way bank is
34:53
making money by giving you loan how does banks make money when they give you loan
34:58
interest everybody understands that right so bank gives you money they make
35:04
interest but they also want to free up some capital
35:09
right because they want to make new loans right dependent on just interest
35:15
technically they had some limited $100 amount they've given 50 to you 50 to
35:20
right they can't make new loans they can't generate new income for them so
35:25
what banks do is bank sells that loan to a third party
35:32
do you understand what happens so then essentially if I am a home owner who has
35:37
taken a loan for my house I pay my interest more to the bank but to that
35:44
third party who has bought my mortgage right now.
35:51
Imagine you're working in that third party institution.
35:56
When do they buy my mortgage? Why would they want to buy my mortgage?
36:04
If I am a good if I am a good creditor, right? If I am very good at paying back
36:11
my mortgage, say for example, bank held my mortgage for 2 years and every month
36:17
I made my mortgage payments. Then after 2 years, bank decides to sell
36:23
that mortgage to a third party institution because they want to
36:26
increase their money. Then they want to make more loans, they want to do more
36:29
business. So they sell it to a third party. Now that third party will
36:34
evaluate whether this mortgage we sold to them is even a good customer or not.
36:43
Right. Right. They have made payment to the bank for the last 2 years but will
36:49
they continue to do so as I hold their mortgage for the next 20 years?
36:56
We don't know right. But I can do some calculations,
37:04
right? And usually, so I would I would ask you to go back and watch that movie
37:10
maybe a little bit or um just read about mortgage back securities, right? So
37:17
mortgage back securities are essentially clo. It's not that the third institution
37:21
just buys my mortgage. Essentially that mortgage back security is mortgages of a
37:27
lot of people with hundreds and thousands of people clubed together into
37:31
one instrument. Right? So now as a person sitting in
37:36
that usually this the financial institution that buys the mortgage back
37:41
securities will uh will get somebody like Moody's or S&P to evaluate the risk
37:49
of the mortgage back security. Right? In that security, let us assume
37:56
today that I have 1,000 people's mortgages.
38:02
Guys, are you following me or is this getting too complex?
38:06
Following, right? This is interesting stuff. Come on, real life.
38:10
I have a question about mortgage. Super attractive. I'm even have the
38:16
funds that can say I for 1 million. Yeah. and I have ‚Ç¨2 million in the bank.
38:23
Isn't that either way more attractive to take out a mortgage or a loan to finance
38:27
my house? Yeah, I mean that's that's more a
38:30
question of personal finance whether you want to use your personal wealth to buy
38:35
an asset or whether you want to take a loan. So yes, say for example right now
38:39
in India if you invested in the financial markets on an average you will
38:42
get a return of 15% annually. Most home loans are 8 to 10%.
38:48
15%. Some of the stocks will give you almost 15%. Oh guys, why you not what's
38:54
happening in India? India is crazy right now. Like
39:01
15%. By the way, guys, guys, guys, this is
39:14
not this is not
39:21
all right. Come on. Settle down.
39:28
There are some fundamental issues with the economy. So that 15% is not going to
39:32
last and we can have a separate discussion outside the class why I think
39:37
that. Of course, there will be other economists who might think otherwise.
39:41
Okay. But I think that 15% is not going to last. And so I am going to be taking
39:45
out some money from the markets very soon.
39:50
Okay. Okay. Okay. Mortgage back securities.
39:54
Come on. Right. Mortgage back securities. I know I am now Leman
39:58
Brothers. You remember you would have been kids. But have you heard of Leman
40:03
Brothers? Right. human brothers giant bank failed
40:09
right so I'm in 2007 right the economy is looking really hot
40:14
mortgage back security interest rates interest rates the housing loans are
40:18
really low and I want to get in on that action right house prices are rising
40:25
real estate is looking really solid people on an average are we seeing
40:30
increase in incomes right so this loan market kind of seemed
40:35
very safe, right? But still, I will do do my due diligence. I'm buying a
40:42
mortgage back security which essentially consists of
40:46
1,000 mortgages,
40:50
right? And now as a person doing due diligence
40:56
I want to know what is the probability that say for example my bosses have told
41:03
me that they're okay if on an average in a month
41:09
50 people fail to pay. They're largely okay. This is what
41:16
you've been told. You've also been told that in a year if I have 3 months where
41:25
about 150 people fail to make their mortgages
41:29
I am okay I will absorb that risk but only for any random 3 months in the year
41:37
right but it is really right they and they will ask you what if like 50% of
41:44
these 1,000 people in this mortgage fail to
41:48
Right. So now I have to calculate the probabilities of each of these events
41:56
occurring. 50% fail to pay 150% fail to pay 500 people fail to pay because that
42:04
means that the mortgage back security that you own
42:07
it's value false right it's nothing you're not getting any income back from
42:12
it right how would you do it like this 1,000
42:20
columns yes
42:26
thank There is a quicker way which is called
42:31
probability distribution.
42:44
And probability distributions essentially allow you
42:49
to ascertain what is the level or what is what are
42:55
the chances of different levels of events happening. What are the chances
43:01
for 50 people failing to pay? What are the chances for 150 people failing to
43:05
pay? What are the chances for 5,000 people failing to pay? Going back to our
43:12
examples of the mega mark, what are the chances that somebody will buy $500
43:16
worth of groceries? What are the chances somebody will buy $200 of groceries?
43:21
What are the chances that someone will buy $50 worth of groceries?
43:26
I hope that intuitively you can see you can see that all of these events knowing
43:34
the chances of happening of all of these events is helping you prepare your
43:39
business better. Does anybody disagree?
43:46
How is it helping you? Say for example in the case of
43:50
the supermarket you understand what get back securities I'm not going to discuss
43:55
for supermarket what are the chances knowing what are the chances of somebody
44:00
buying $500 worth of groceries how does it help you
44:07
efficiency efficiency right how much to order from
44:11
the supplier you look like you look where most people
44:15
have and like Once a week by whatever one puts your one day and when one
44:22
product pops on another one drops. Exactly. Right. So now in Yes.
44:28
then gives you
44:34
Yeah, of course you will have to go. The price doesn't help you.
44:40
If I just have the price as what do you mean by that? And you go
44:45
for high price. Yeah. Okay. So, for example, you would
44:49
want to know how many people people are interested in. Say we have two brands of
44:53
uh shower gels. One is expensive, one is not, right? One is maybe $5, the other
44:59
is 100, right? What are the chances that somebody will buy $100 worth of shower
45:05
gel versus what are the chances that yeah I'm just trying to explain to you
45:13
in very basic forms you could do these exercises for like very detailed
45:19
questions right who is going to how many people are going to prefer a more
45:24
expensive product compared to how many people are going to prefer a less
45:27
expensive product right and the The the the way a probability distribution is
45:34
going to help you is say for example
45:47
remember histogram. Histogram what did histogram allow allow
45:51
us to do? Continuous.
45:55
Yeah we plotted continuous variable but what did it allow you to see? compare
46:01
different what level of
46:05
frequency histograms allowed you to compare
46:10
frequency of different data points. Remember we we do this
46:16
uh we have like ages bins right say for example 22 22 22 to 24 and so on and you
46:26
could compare How many number of times a certain data
46:32
point occurred in your data? Right? Is there a question?
46:38
Instagram. Oh god. No. In his Instagram does not
46:41
help you a lot. Histograms do histograms. I'm sorry if my uh
46:48
annunciations are not very clear. Histograms.
46:59
Right. So,
47:05
histogram technically allowed you to see how many number of times an event was
47:10
happening, right? Probability distributions look
47:14
similar as in on the x-axis I am plotting the event.
47:23
Say for example for that credit card default
47:26
zero people fail to pay one person fails to pay 2 3 4 5 to 1,000
47:35
right and now what I will do is create the entire sample space
47:42
right for all of the events happening right which is like I don't even realize
47:47
it's a ginormous matrix the the entire sample space for all of
47:53
these events but I can then calculate individual
47:58
probabilities. So for example, probability here will be from 0 to one.
48:03
I hope it is clear. Probability is always between 0 and one.
48:07
Does does anybody have a doubt regarding that?
48:11
Right. Basics. Yes. Oh, I'll tell you how it's just too
48:19
much. Right. Essentially,
48:23
at some point I will have points with which I can create lines.
48:32
Right? Have you heard that your lines can have equations? Lines can be
48:39
represented by equations. You know that,
48:43
right? Y= MX + C is what? Equation of a line, a straight line,
48:53
right? Some of you who did maybe advanced math in high school, you would
48:58
have done equations for parabas, circles,
49:03
quadratic equation. Quadratic equation, what does it look like?
49:09
Right? So technically there can be equations which can represent these
49:15
probability distributions. Right?
49:19
So the way probability distributions help you is that if you knew certain
49:25
characteristics of the distribution, you could model it mathematically here.
49:32
Don't worry, we're not going into the modeling. We're not going to cover the
49:35
mathematical part of it. But it was important for me to discuss all of this
49:40
because at some point when you do operations management, I don't want that
49:44
class to hate me for not discussing this.
49:50
and also you will find it very useful. Anyway,
49:54
so you can have say for example, if you
49:58
knew the mean and standard deviation, right? You could create the probability
50:05
distribution for a normal curve. It's called normal or bell curve or washing
50:12
curve caution distribution, right? And that would allow you to see
50:27
Right? So say for example, let us assume that
50:32
I will I will give you the uh spellings. Say for example, you have been told that
50:38
the probability distribution of people defaulting on their home loans looks
50:44
like a bell curve, right? with a mean of 20%
50:52
or 2% people 2 for everybody failing and a standard deviation of + - 5
51:03
right this will allow me to create a bell curve
51:10
where we have a mean and we have standard deviation
51:16
which will tell that individually what is the probability of say here 5% people
51:22
failing what is the probability of 20% people
51:26
failing what is the probability of 80% people failing this is a very rough idea
51:33
for how probability distributions look like
51:37
okay right now you can do this for everything
51:42
for example supply lines right supply lines Somebody could tell you that this
51:49
average supply time is 3 days. The standard deviation is 1 day, right? And
51:55
if they told you that it is going to look like gion or bell cost, right?
52:01
Technically, you could draw this curve and then they could you could tell your
52:05
boss exactly what is the probability that this person will uh uh ship the
52:12
product or deliver the product in 5 days.
52:16
an event which is B because we know that average is 3 days uh standard deviation
52:23
is one day technically we know this person will
52:28
deliver mostly in 3 + - 1 right
52:38
technically we know this but we also want to know what are the chances that
52:41
they deliver in 5 days an event which we had previously categorized out as
52:47
outlier but we're still interested to know because we want to contain our risk
52:55
right probability distribution clear what is probability distribution helping
53:00
you do figure out the probability of things
53:07
that you otherwise would know with just standard deviations once you plot the
53:12
graph you can see what five wants to win Can you say
53:25
sorry what's Xar
53:29
Xar mean right? So now probability distributions
53:35
help us. This curve which we will come back to in detail next class as well is
53:43
either called a bell curve or normal
53:52
or cape. Okay.
54:03
Now, do you think probability distributions for all events will look
54:07
like this? Okay, I'm glad that you've heard of
54:20
these things. Fine. Technically, so what you said,
54:29
what? Oh, that's my husband again. I'm going to just not answer this call.
54:37
Oh, I wish we could have done like a thing, but okay, fine. Uh, we don't have
54:41
time. Okay. Okay. So, what where was I?
54:48
Right. Huh? Whether most naturally occuring phenomena will be normal or
54:53
not? No. But you're also right. And I will tell you why.
55:00
Technically you have a lot of distributions possible for different
55:05
phenomena right if you ever want to get into the details of that we will so by
55:11
the way you must have gotten the message for like outclass discussions or
55:14
anything right I think tomorrow and day after but we can also sit even in more
55:21
detail uh discuss why probability distributions for like a lot of other
55:27
events can be different from this I will be different from this
55:31
and like they can be plotted normally if they have like more than two if it's
55:36
just two it will be one if they're all discrete then it will be this thing but
55:44
they can all be normally no one even
55:48
that is explained by CL we'll discuss that at the end of this
55:55
class and it makes sense right but for the benefit of everyone
55:59
Right? We now understand probability distributions. Right? They're helping us
56:04
understand what are the chances of different events happening.
56:10
Right? I have also told you that you can mathematically model
56:16
right. So you can arrive at equations mathematically which will allow you to
56:22
give probability distributions for different events. Say for example if you
56:27
had a two event trial right say tossing of a coin or a yes and
56:32
yes or no question that is so it's a bin trial
56:39
so a bmal distribution right sorry
56:46
uh so essentially
56:54
Five. Binomial distribution constitutes of
56:59
multiple Boli trials. If I toss a coin once, right? Bernoli is just the name of
57:06
like a fancy scientist, right? Huh? Trial and error. What?
57:14
Uh well, it can be if you want to guess and no question, right? So essentially
57:19
any event that has two outcomes is termed as a trial crossing of a coin
57:25
heads or tails right if I give a product you like it or not yes or no
57:34
yeah so if I do do it once if there but if I do it for the entire class and I
57:40
map it out right then it is a binomial distribution right say for example I
57:46
asked you do you like my product or You said no, right? That's okay. I can I can
57:52
make that, right? You said no, right? So, that is one person saying definitely
57:57
no for my product. But now I go on and ask everybody else yes or no. Yes or no?
58:03
Yes or no? Yes or no, right? And then I will have an idea, right? I will have a
58:09
name and I will have the probability of one person liking my product or not,
58:16
right? So for example in this class 40 said no 60 said yes. I know there's a
58:20
cross possibility 6 that somebody will like my product right that will then
58:27
allow me to create a binomial distribution which looks like a skewed
58:32
bell curve right and skewed do you understand what skewed means?
58:38
No skewed syntax. It's weighted to one side, right? So the property of B is
58:44
essentially it's balanced about the name,
58:48
right? Equal number of data points here, equal number of data points here. SK
58:52
would simply mean say for example like this,
58:56
right? The word is shifted a little bit, right? my normal distribution that will
59:01
allow me to literally go to the other class and calculate what is the
59:06
probability that in this class 90 will buy my product. What is the probability
59:10
that a will buy product? What is the probability that 50 product
59:16
right? So binomial distribution is one such example. There is also as we said
59:22
this poison right poison distribution is essentially
59:27
when you try to calculate how many times an event occurs in a
59:34
given interval. Say for example you run a customer
59:40
service office. How many calls do you get in 1 hour can
59:46
be modeled as perform. Right now you do not need to care about the details of
59:52
what event can be modeled through which distribution. For that you will have a
59:57
more advanced course. But
1:00:01
do we now agree that have I convinced you to some degree
1:00:06
that not everything will be normal? probability distributions will be varied
1:00:15
right then. Yes. It's it's cute. It's technically yes it
1:00:26
is still it's still normal and uh I'm just telling you because if you want to
1:00:32
explore you can so technically there are different levels of moments you can
1:00:36
describe for a distribution right so normal distribution when balanced you
1:00:41
are only talking about mean standard deviation but there is a separate moment
1:00:45
called um stress and there is a third moment
1:00:51
calledis wall did not get
1:00:56
nothing I'm not discussing that okay because
1:01:02
that's that's outside the scope of what we are discussing what the objective of
1:01:05
this course is cortosis and skewness again help you understand distribution
1:01:11
even better okay for now that is enough for you to
1:01:15
know you can explore it on your own right but so technically still normal
1:01:21
but then you add more characteristics to define it probably. Yes.
1:01:28
And uh yeah. So skeless.
1:01:46
Okay. If you're interested in trying to understand what that is. All right.
1:01:53
So so many distributions to try to understand what could happen.
1:01:58
So technically over the course of last 15 minutes or so I have only made your
1:02:04
life more difficult. This has not simplified anything for us has it?
1:02:11
Not really. No. Yeah.
1:02:13
A little bit. How like
1:02:18
classes now it's like oh that's why. Okay. Okay. I'm glad it makes sense. Uh
1:02:23
so I have put in the slides some descriptions of and bol
1:02:28
and boli. You can go through it. You don't need to remember it for any exam
1:02:32
or anything. All right? So if you're interested,
1:02:36
you can like research for yourself. But statisticians
1:02:43
are clever people. We don't want to do so much hard work. Right? No. So we have
1:02:52
two laws that help us simplify everything for us. Okay. The first is
1:03:01
the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers tells you that
1:03:14
if you repeated an experiment multiple times, say for example, you're
1:03:22
interested in knowing the ages of possible potential customers.
1:03:26
You did multiple surveys. You gave a survey in each of the four sections. You
1:03:31
also gave surveys to students of other universities uh in academic city. You
1:03:35
gave surveys to people in back home in your countries,
1:03:41
right? If you did that and then you arrived at the measures of central
1:03:48
tendency especially the mean that mean is going to be very close to
1:03:56
your population means after election.
1:04:03
Exit polls after elections. A very good example right. So what exit PS do is
1:04:10
essentially talk to some people coming back from they can't talk to everyone
1:04:15
right for a country like India it's 800 million people
1:04:22
huh the 800 people of ving age come on right
1:04:30
so 800 million people not possible to interview but if I to meet as many
1:04:38
people as possible, right? I went to one poll, I talked to some people, I went to
1:04:45
another polling booth, I talked to some people, I I went to hundreds of polling
1:04:49
groups across the country, right? And the main sentiment that I gather from
1:04:57
there mean sentiment for which party people are voting for the mean sentiment
1:05:02
related to the product that you are selling out in the market is going to
1:05:07
approximately be close to the true population mean.
1:05:14
So what does this tell you for your product?
1:05:19
Yes. You have to
1:05:24
you have to collect a lot of data as much as possible.
1:05:31
Exactly. Right. So say for example we have we
1:05:38
don't have time but I was going to actually do the coin tosses right. So if
1:05:42
I toss one coin technically the probability is.5
1:05:47
but when you actually look at the event that event could be heads or tails
1:05:53
right which means now I can also have I could
1:05:57
do three point losses right and even though my probability for head or tail
1:06:02
is.5 I could still end up with two heads
1:06:08
right just because the probability of something is a given
1:06:12
doesn't necessarily mean that it will happen that many times
1:06:17
right just because I say the probability of something happening is 90% does it
1:06:22
are you sure that it will happen no right it could not happen
1:06:29
right and therefore you need to have a large sample either you have a very
1:06:37
large sample right or you have a lot small samples.
1:06:43
Both of these for you are going to do the work that they will tell you how
1:06:51
that you are very close to the population mean.
1:06:56
Right? So if you want to sell a pair of jeans to people, college students,
1:07:02
talk to as many people as possible, right? That is the logic behind
1:07:08
sampling. Right? You try as many samples as
1:07:13
possible, right? And essentially then law of large
1:07:19
numbers will tell you that if you've tried a lot of samples, those samples
1:07:24
are going to mimic the characteristics of the true population.
1:07:35
Right? Questions about law of large numbers?
1:07:39
No. Right. But again, does this help you in
1:07:44
terms how how easy is it to do a lot of surveys?
1:07:49
Not very, right? Doesn't really help you because
1:07:53
all I've told you is do more work, right? Not easy. So, what do we do now?
1:08:04
This brings us to The central limit clear
1:08:17
the text till I clear the board. So it's multiple samples, right? It's
1:08:27
not just one sample distribution. Multiple samples.
1:08:31
Yes. Does the text make sense at all?
1:08:47
So for you does does it now help you understand why
1:08:53
we almost always model real life phenomena as a bell curve?
1:09:00
What is what is CLT telling us? Yeah, you can. But what you're saying is
1:09:10
that the probability distribution itself is a B. Is that what he said?
1:09:24
That's not the C is telling you. The CNT is telling you that irrespective
1:09:31
of what the population distribution was, if I just kept picking out samples from
1:09:39
it, sample s I picked samples, calculated
1:09:44
the sample means and created a probability distribution of those sample
1:09:50
means, those are normally distributed.
1:09:56
Right? irrespective of what the real phenomena look like.
1:10:12
Thank you. Did you understand? Right. So if I tossed coins my normal for sure but
1:10:19
in that I keep picking out samples. Right. So say for example you did 1
1:10:26
million coin tosses and you plotted that by normal distribution. Right? Of those
1:10:32
1 million coin tosses you picked first 100 and you plotted the mean of that.
1:10:38
that is going to give you one say some mean right?
1:10:45
Then you put it back. You put the 100 uh samples back. You pick some other 100
1:10:51
random samples. You plot that and you keep plotting that and what you will get
1:10:59
is a balanced normal distribution.
1:11:17
Well, there is a mathematical derivation for
1:11:22
it which I am certain is not useful for any
1:11:27
of you but I can show it to you on Excel.
1:11:33
That's the best I can do to explain this particular thing which involves some
1:11:38
math of it. There is a mathematical proof to it that why millions of samples
1:11:45
will look like a normal course. It's kind of advanced.
1:11:51
I don't want to touch for the benefit of everyone is not interested. If you're
1:11:56
really interested, I'll take the class. Okay.
1:12:01
Questions. Will this happen every time?
1:12:16
How big? Very good.
1:12:21
So for data to solve a CLT
1:12:27
you have some conditions. First sampling is done with replacement.
1:12:35
You understand replacement remember that basket of balls right? We
1:12:43
put the balls back after we pick one ball. put the put the ball back so that
1:12:49
my entire population stays the same. Right? Think of it also like this. Say
1:12:54
for example, you are at the checkout counter for a uh for a supermarket or an
1:12:59
apparel store. Right? In that store, you have one person coming who has a 60%
1:13:06
chance that they will like your product, right? And ultimately they have decided
1:13:12
that they will buy it. So they come to you, they get uh they get the product
1:13:16
checked out. Uh they pay you fine. Has this person
1:13:22
affected the chances of the next customer buying or not buying your
1:13:27
product? Not really. Though psych in psychology
1:13:35
sometimes you will be explained that you know some things are really flying off
1:13:39
the shelves really fast. uh that sort of has an impact on people in terms of
1:13:44
whether something is good or not. Right? That is true. But say for example, if
1:13:50
two customers do not interact with each other at all, right? Technically,
1:13:56
the first customer buying or not buying your product does not affect
1:14:03
the chances of the second customer buying or not buying your product.
1:14:08
Right? It's very easy to visualize when you have um an ad based selling
1:14:13
platform, right? Like you have for a drop shipping business. Technically, I
1:14:17
can't see whether other customer has bought or not bought, right? Sometimes
1:14:22
websites will try to manipulate customers by saying, "Oh, 543 people
1:14:27
using this product right now, right? Because they're sort of trying to play
1:14:31
manipulate you a little bit." But technically, these are independent
1:14:36
events. The condition for making a sample
1:14:51
independent of each other is that technically a sampling is done by
1:14:58
replacement. Right? Knowing that if I was to sample
1:15:02
people from the school of better students 200 people and I decided that
1:15:08
for a really robust idea of what college students like I will pick samples of 30
1:15:14
people for samples of 30 people. Right?
1:15:21
The four samples that I create should not be independent of you. It should not
1:15:27
be dependent on each other. meaning that if you feature in the first sample that
1:15:31
should not affect your chances of featuring in the second sample. So
1:15:36
technically I could have one person featuring in all samples all the four
1:15:41
samples or I could have people who don't feature in any
1:15:46
right and this brings in the quality of randomness in your sample.
1:15:53
Right? Because you've done the experiment, each trial has been
1:15:58
conducted independently, right? And for your data to exhibit this
1:16:05
normal distribution of means of the sample, your samples have to be
1:16:11
independent of each other. They have been drawn. The samples have been
1:16:15
created with replacement.
1:16:22
Okay. So random independent with replacement
1:16:29
and what is sufficiently large
1:16:34
n is equal to 30 right? Those samples
1:16:41
has to be of the size at least 30. This number again has been arrived at
1:16:48
with a lot of trial and errors. Okay, so basically we'll see this even more
1:16:55
when we actually delve into the probability
1:16:59
distribution of a normal curve. Okay, so
1:17:05
does this help you at all? Remember in the first class when we were talking
1:17:11
about how sometimes your sample can be inadequate.
1:17:17
How does CL help you? It makes it less
1:17:28
a little bit, right? If you did your due diligence, right? If you did your due
1:17:33
diligence and figured out that I have to randomly pick out people, technically to
1:17:38
some extent, you could weed out bias, right? To some extent there will be
1:17:47
other ways of removing biases from your data which some of which we will learn
1:17:52
some of which you will learn in marketing methodologies qualitative
1:17:56
research all of that. Okay. But ensuring that I have done
1:18:03
independent sampling of people with replacement and have chosen people at
1:18:08
randomly. There is no systemic reason for people to be in a particular sample.
1:18:15
Right? That will ensure that I can sufficiently
1:18:22
make logical conclusions about any piece of population. Say for
1:18:28
example, I am interested in knowing whether 21 to
1:18:34
25 year olds are interested. I'm I'm I'm selling protein powder.
1:18:41
Whether 21 to 25 year olds are interested in buying protein powder
1:18:47
and I go to a high school football team. Oh, sorry. Not not high school, college
1:18:53
football team. Sorry. Yeah, college football team. Is it about sambar?
1:18:59
Not really. Why? Because the sambar has been chosen
1:19:03
systemically. Yeah, obviously. Yeah, correct.
1:19:24
I don't know music. Yeah.
1:19:27
Right. And then you so so your randomness
1:19:31
so basically the objective is yeah there should not be systematic
1:19:38
choosing of the sample right that people should not be a part of the sample
1:19:42
because they were part of the music club right that is absolutely bad way of
1:19:49
sampling right okay question
1:19:53
are better group of students a good sample for you to guess the
1:20:00
characteristics of college students around the world.
1:20:04
Why no? Very good. Most of you are interested in
1:20:11
business, right? Say for example, if my question was if my question was how
1:20:17
interested are students of 18 to 21 years uh uh about learning uh
1:20:24
theoretical physics. So
1:20:30
you want to make a sample to approximate the population right
1:20:43
it's just how you are as a person that is a good way
1:20:48
different so say for example
1:20:52
if my question was that I have to sell I'm designing a product to sell for 18
1:20:57
to 21. Then data is a good example. Maybe we have a lot of people from a lot
1:21:03
of countries, right? We have some variations in age groups and
1:21:09
expectations of what they might like, right? It's not the best sample, but it
1:21:15
could be a good sample, right? Could be. On the other hand, people who like
1:21:21
physics are not a great great place to start, right? I
1:21:27
need to talk to all kinds of college students to get an understanding of who
1:21:32
will like this or not. Right, questions?
1:21:42
Okay, we have 2 minutes left. So, I will discuss one tiny topic as well. All
1:21:49
right, which is expectations, right?
1:21:55
I actually technically made an error. I was supposed to discuss it when we were
1:21:59
discussing probability. Say for example, you have a product,
1:22:05
right? Which could 6% 60% of the people would like,
1:22:11
40% of the people don't like, right? and you stand to make a profit of
1:22:18
$100 if you sell that product or a loss of
1:22:25
$10 if you don't sell the product, right?
1:22:30
Why why a loss of $10? Because technically then you have to store it,
1:22:35
you have to pay for warehousing, all of those things. You have to spend some
1:22:38
money. So there is some loss in not selling the product, right? So you stand
1:22:43
for every product you stand to make $100 for the sale
1:22:49
and lose $10 for not making the sale.
1:22:55
Possibility of buying is 60% and 40% of not buying.
1:23:02
So if I was this is the information I have. If I come to you,
1:23:10
what are my expectations from this transaction? How much money do I stand
1:23:14
to make or lose for every transaction that I make?
1:23:24
Yeah. So, can you give me the exact numbers?
1:23:31
So, 6 into 100 uh minus
1:23:38
uh what this is my expectation from each
1:23:46
transaction right whatever whatever this comes out
1:23:51
to be so on an average this means if I went to any random person on an average
1:23:56
I stand to make some money right do you now see how realizing
1:24:04
expectations S helps us understand for each event my risk.
1:24:14
So what is the risk? Risk is say for example
1:24:19
if these probabilities were 20% sorry 10% and 90%.
1:24:26
Right? So this would become 10 and 90. So - 90 and 30 for every transaction I
1:24:35
will stand to lose some money right which means this is not a great product
1:24:43
right I can do the same calculations remember when we did uh credit pay back
1:24:49
capability to pay back credit right if I start to lose more money
1:24:58
for every time I lend to those three people then those are really bad
1:25:03
customers right
1:25:06
how how do I use it right so in the financial markets this
1:25:14
is used for giving credit ratings to individuals and countries
1:25:20
and institutions right so for example credit rating
1:25:26
agency gives me a so I know in US it's FICO In India, it is some civil rating
1:25:31
or something, right? You would have for each of your countries individual
1:25:35
institutes who assign credit ratings to individuals,
1:25:40
right? And that information would be based on the expectations,
1:25:47
right? How likely an event is to happen and if that event happened, what is the
1:25:53
payoff from that event? All right. Oh yeah, I'm sorry I I
1:25:59
plugged this plugged this in in the last of the class because we were discussing
1:26:03
probability distribution. I saw a lot to discuss in this flow but essentially
1:26:10
setting so understanding these expectations allow us to see how each
1:26:15
transaction is beneficial for us or not. Right? something like me
1:26:23
but a little better because now I can see exactly from each transaction or
1:26:29
trial how much do I stand to benefit or lose.
1:26:34
Got it? Okay. So what all we have discussed today? Probability clear,
1:26:39
distributions clear, expectations clear, law of large numbers.
1:26:46
Tell us what is law of large numbers. Yes, please.
1:27:01
Yeah. If your sample was large or you had a
1:27:06
lot of samples, you would very closely approximate the true population
1:27:11
characteristics right and because I can't deal with all
1:27:17
those samples large samples and all then we had central limit theorem. central
1:27:23
limit theorem told us that if I pick out samples of at least 30 from any
1:27:30
probability distribution technically I would get a gshian or a normal
1:27:37
distribution. So this is what statisticians do. Any base probability
1:27:43
distribution our value distribution is gshian or
1:27:49
normal because we will see in next class. Gshian distributions are terribly
1:27:56
easy to deal with very simple and that is what we will use for almost
1:28:03
all of our data analysis. Okay. Thank you.
