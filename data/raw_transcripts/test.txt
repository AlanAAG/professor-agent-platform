0:01
But specifically probability and what did we find out? How is probability
0:06
useful to us? How is probability useful to us?
0:20
the chances of a certain event happening, right? To help us with that.
0:27
So, we had ultimately understood that we have probability distributions for
0:33
multiple situations, right? Given that you know some
0:38
information, right? Let's say for example for your product you do conduct
0:42
a pilot survey out out with some college students and you figure out that 60% of
0:49
the people are going to like your product. 60% of the people have said
0:52
they will buy your product right but you need to prepare better. 60% is not
0:59
enough for you. That information that 60% people will uh buy my product does
1:04
not tell you exactly how many people will buy a product,
1:09
right? It does not tell you what are the chances that on a given day maybe only
1:13
100 people buy a product or on any other given day a thousand people buy a
1:18
product. Right? Just because the probability is 60% doesn't mean that
1:22
that probability will be realized. Right? And therefore to help us with
1:28
that we have something called probability distributions.
1:33
Probability distributions are nothing but the relative chances of
1:40
events happening. Say for example if I was plotting the probability
1:45
distribution of whether a person will click on your ad or not right I could
1:52
even if say a person is 40% likely to click on your ad right and you push your
1:59
ad to 100 customers does not mean that 40% people will click on your ad right
2:07
you could have on a given day only 20 people click on your ad on some other
2:11
given day you could have 100 people click on your ad, right? And therefore
2:15
to help us with that we have something called probability distribution which
2:20
could look like anything right and essentially what it is telling
2:25
you is that for a very specific point right say n equal to 20
2:34
that given that you know that there's a 40% chance that someone clicks on your
2:39
ad what are the chances that on a given day 20 people will land on your website.
2:47
Right? So this is what we are able to get from probability distributions.
2:52
But probability distributions are tough to deal with. Lot of math involved. And
2:59
to help us deal with that we have two theorems.
3:03
One was law of large numbers. Anybody recap for me what the law of large
3:09
numbers was? we get closer to the population mean as
3:22
as our sample keeps increasing in size or if we keep repeating repeatedly
3:28
choosing samples. Right? So do you want to see how it
3:32
actually works? Say for example,
3:41
so I have this data. Okay. Can you Okay, I'll make it.
3:52
Uh why won't this go bigger?
4:00
Okay, so this is my warehouse. I have data from warehouse where I have an item
4:06
ID. Okay. I have the supplier from whom I have gotten the data whether that item
4:14
that I have is defective or not. Right? And I have some other data on shelf
4:20
life. All right. This is usually what your inventory management data will look
4:24
like. Okay. you will have now in here I have how many 50,000 rows
4:34
right in this particular warehouse 50,000 units but you will almost always
4:39
end up dealing with hundreds of thousands of units of goods right
4:44
hopefully but now I'm going to try to apply law of
4:50
large numbers to this set of data all right so say for example example, this
4:56
50,000 is my total population. Total population means all of the data
5:02
that I'm going to be concerned with, right? And now my job is to figure out
5:08
how many pieces are randomly defective, right? I go on into my warehouse and I
5:15
do a quality check. How do you think quality check inspections happen? Right?
5:20
When you have a quality control guy coming in in your to your warehouse to
5:24
see whether your product is defective or not, do you think they sample
5:28
everything? Do you think do you think they they look
5:31
at every product? No, they use a sample. Right? So say this is my population
5:39
50,000 of which mean
5:59
oh average right this is my true
6:09
population mean. Okay, true population mean. I hope you
6:15
understand what does true population mean mean?
6:22
So what what is this point to def uh showing us? Can you even see the board?
6:29
Okay. What what does what is this number
6:32
telling me? If if I had a variable called defect which was zero or one zero
6:39
for non-deective one for defective right and if I took a mean of that what
6:45
is this telling me% of your
6:51
items are defected right so the mean of the defect
6:56
variable is telling me that total 20% of the items are defective in my warehouse
7:02
house right this is the true population mean will I ever know the true
7:07
population mean this is a data that I have given you
7:12
will you ever know the true population mean no right you can't because
7:19
this is a data that I have constructed for to show to you that okay this is how
7:23
it will work technically you will never have a data like this at best what you
7:28
will have data for is maybe you sample 100 products
7:32
and you figure out what the probability is. Okay, so true population mean is how
7:38
close you how many total number of proportion of products are defective.
7:44
Okay, now what we do is we pick out samples from these 50,000.
7:50
Okay. Now, how do we pick on random sample from Excel list is through a
7:57
command called random. Okay. And what random does for you is it
8:06
generates any number between 0 and 1. Okay. It'll just randomly generate a
8:12
number from 0 and 1 which then you can use to shuffle your
8:19
values. Okay. Say for example I I said random
8:25
and every time I click on it, it takes on a different value and then I can
8:29
shuffle it. Okay. So I think this is for all my
8:33
data, right? Huh? Right. So I pick a sample of 30 units. All right. Say I'm
8:42
going to pick these 30.
8:58
I put it here. Okay. Now this is the data on the sample
9:07
defect whether products are defective or not in the sample of 30 products. Right?
9:14
I look at the mean. Oh average how much is the how many products are
9:26
defective here? 16%
9:29
16%. Right? What is the true population defect rate?
9:34
20%. Right? Is this close to that? Maybe not very right. But what if I keep
9:44
doing this again and again? All right. So again I
9:50
sorry I pick out
10:03
sorry 30 units Okay.
10:21
Sample rate, uh, defect rate, 13%. Right, we've gotten further away
10:28
from what we wanted to do. But if I go Oh, sorry.
11:11
What's the issue? What's the sample defect rate?
11:36
As I've increase the sample size, I've gotten a little bit closer to the true
11:40
population mean. Right? The other way I could do this is to draw out samples of
11:48
30, but I draw out those samples maybe 20 times.
11:53
Okay? So, say for example here I've got a defect rate of 26%.
12:03
Right? But what is the mean defect rate of all three samples?
12:10
average 18.
12:14
We're a little bit closer to the true population mean, right?
12:20
I could go on to do this exercise 10 more times. And if when I calculate the
12:25
mean, I will get very close to the true population mean. That is what law of
12:30
large numbers is. You keep repeating an experiment and you will ultimately
12:36
approach the true population mean. All right? you do as much sampling as
12:42
possible. All right. So I had actually already
12:47
done this. So I think I created like yeah whatever number of samples
12:56
and the mean here is.17. I don't know if you can see it or not. I I'll just
13:00
calculate it for you. the mean is 7. If I did this exercise 20
13:17
more times, I will approach to closer to the true population mean. Okay. Now next
13:25
thing that we had was the central limit theorem because technically all law law
13:30
of large numbers have told us is that we have to run an experiment a lot of times
13:35
right this hasn't still helped us with figuring out chances of something
13:39
happening right for chances to understand the chances of different
13:44
events happening we have the central limit theorem what the central limit
13:48
theorem says is if I consistently keep drawing samples from a group population
13:55
and I plot the means of that they are going to mimic a normal distribution. We
14:02
saw the saw a normal distribution yesterday.
14:10
This is what it looks like. Okay.
14:17
So what essentially I'm doing is again drawing out a lot of samples,
14:23
calculating the mean of each of those samples and then I plot the mean. So I
14:30
will draw a histogram for all of my means. So this histogram has actually
14:35
been drawn for these. Okay. And if I did this enough number of times, I will end
14:41
up with a normal curve. Right? Yes. What's the
14:47
enough number of times? So
14:51
technically 30 n is you. So basically sample size is 30 and then
14:57
it is assumed that once you have a sample size of 30, we can represent the
15:03
true population through a normal curve. Right? For theoretical purposes, if you
15:09
want to know um how many number of times you need to plot the means to get a his
15:14
uh to get a normal curve, you will maybe need to do it like 10, 15, 20 times.
15:20
All right? But what CLT then eventually has done for us is that even if we have
15:28
one sample of 30 units or more, technically I can use the normal curve
15:35
to represent the true population distribution.
15:38
Right? Because I am making the assumption that each of the points on
15:42
the normal curve on the x-axis, right? X-axis is essentially data
15:49
points, different data points, right? Each of these points actually represent
15:53
a mean from a sample, right? So you don't have to go about
16:00
running 100 samples to create a normal curve and then arrive at your test
16:07
results. The mathematicians have already done
16:10
that aggregation and they're telling you that even if you run one sample of 100
16:15
people, 50 people, 150 people, 1200 people, right? Technically because of
16:21
some mathematical uh assumptions that they have made, you can use
16:27
the normal curve to sort of mean that each of these points is a mean for a
16:33
true population sample. Okay. So, technically say if you have
16:40
run a sample of 30 people, right? You've surveyed a sample of 30 people for your
16:45
product preferences. And of those 30 people, somebody has said uh they're
16:50
willing to pay $5. Somebody has said they're willing to pay $10, 12, 6, 7, 8,
16:58
15. Right? So the assumption is that each of these points are a mean of a
17:06
larger sample even if you are just running this sample.
17:11
Okay. So it's technically you have already been given the leeway that you
17:16
can work with one sample and assume that this sample each points in this sample
17:22
that you've arrived at are a representative of a larger sample in the
17:26
true population. Okay.
17:30
So that brings us to the normal curve. Now normal curve is a beautiful thing.
17:40
So I hope we are clear that irrespective of the true population distribution
17:46
I can use the normal curve to model probabilities for all types of events.
17:53
Did anybody go back and look at like Bernoli or binomial distribution,
17:58
exponential distribution? No. When you have the slides, you can take a look at
18:02
them. Most of your phenomena are not normal in nature.
18:08
Okay? Some are. Say for example, if I plotted the heights of all the people
18:12
histogram of heights of people in this class,
18:18
it'll most likely be normal, right? But other than that, it's
18:24
possible that there are a lot of phenomena in the world that are not
18:27
normal. But we are still going to use the normal curve. When I say not normal,
18:33
I don't mean abnormal. I just mean not the normal curve. Okay? In this class,
18:37
normal means normal curve. So we will ultimately end up using the
18:45
so even if you have a probability distribution looking like this
18:49
CLLD allows you to model it like this. Okay
18:56
fine. Now how do we actually get the probabilities of individual things in a
19:01
normal curve? So for that we first need to understand
19:07
what the different parts of the normal curve mean.
19:11
Okay. Now normal curve is symmetric about its center.
19:18
Okay. Symmetric about its center means that
19:21
here at this point you have the mean or median
19:30
or mode. So what normal the characteristic of
19:34
normal curve is that the mean is equal to the median is equal to the mode.
19:40
Right? Again remember for your data these three numbers might be different
19:45
but for probability analysis we are going to make the assumption that that
19:50
the case is that mean median and mode are all equal.
19:55
Okay guys, everybody who's doing other stuff, you're going to miss out on
20:00
something very important because all of this you will have to do on your own
20:03
when you have the assignment and the exam. So I don't know how you are
20:09
thinking of getting through that while working on something else in class.
20:17
The other characteristic of a normal curve is that our ends the tails never
20:23
meet a zero. What does this mean? The word is
20:27
asymptoic. The tails are asymptoic. What asymptoic
20:33
means is say for example you have a product for which you have
20:39
found out then on an average people in the ages of 28 to 32 like that product.
20:48
Does that mean that somebody who is 54 years old will never buy your product?
20:55
There's still a possibility that that might happen, right? Somebody who is
21:00
really old or really young might suddenly come up and say that actually
21:04
want to buy the product. Right? If you have a supplier who says that I will
21:09
supply on an average in 8 to 10 days, does that mean that their shipping will
21:15
never get delayed by a month? No. Right. It could happen. If you
21:20
remember a few years ago, we had a a crisis in the sways, right? The the
21:26
channel got blocked and therefore nothing could across like shipping
21:30
across the world, shipping times across the world got uh increased by like a
21:35
month or so, right? So even though you have a
21:42
range which is considered reasonable for if you have an average of 8 days of
21:47
delivery time it's pos 20 days is a reasonable amount of delay doesn't mean
21:53
that the delay cannot be for like a 100 days
21:58
right probability of an event is never going to be zero
22:04
the most unlikely situation could still happen and that is what I mean by these
22:10
asymtotic tails. The probability for these are always
22:15
going to be non zero. So technically these lines never touch the x-axis.
22:22
Right? What we have on the yaxis is probability
22:27
density. Now remember probability density is not
22:39
probability right. So say for example if you have a
22:47
normal curve and you see a number like 04 here it doesn't mean that the
22:52
probability for this point is 40%. No. Okay. When you have a probability
23:00
density function, technically what you have on the x-axis
23:05
is probability per unit length because we are plotting this for a continuous
23:10
function. Continuous variable. What were continuous variables?
23:16
Do you guys remember what were continuous variables?
23:21
What were continuous variables? Sorry.
23:28
repeating. Yeah. What does that mean? Continuous.
23:33
Some if something is continuous. Yeah. So they can your height technically if I
23:43
wanted to measure your height, I could measure it to the fifth decimal place if
23:49
I had the instruments, right? Your height could be uh 54.62.
23:56
6 2 6 3 2 1 9 cm. If I wanted, right? If I had the correct instruments, I could
24:04
measure your height to this accuracy,
24:09
right? So for continuous variables you will never have
24:14
an a specific point that is possible where you can possibly say that you know
24:19
the probability of somebody's height being 153 cm is so and so for continuous
24:26
variable you can never have a probability of a point because the
24:30
question then becomes where do you stop right say for example if I stand facing
24:36
this wall and I tell you that every time in every step I'm only going to cover
24:42
half the distance there is between me and the wall. Right? So if I'm four 5T
24:47
right now I take one step and now I'm 2.5 ft. I take another step. So what is
24:53
half of 2.5? Uh 1.25 right? I take another step but now I'm
25:00
going to cover half of 1.25. Will I ever reach the wall?
25:07
No. Right? Because whatever even if say I am
25:11
uh uh 0.32 ft away from the wall
25:16
the next step could be 0.16 ft away
25:21
right I'm always trying to cover half the distance I'm away from the wall so
25:25
technically I would never reach the wall that is the same thing with continuous
25:29
variables right if I had a scale that only measures in like 151 152 153 154
25:37
something like that and doesn't give me the first decimal point cm that scale
25:44
then that is the data I have but I could get a better scale which gives me which
25:49
allows me to measure height at this level at this granularity.
25:53
So for continuous variables you will never be able to claim that probability
25:59
of finding someone whose height is 154 cm.
26:06
I can never calculate this right because what does this 154 mean? Does 153.99999
26:15
is this 154? Is 154.00001
26:21
is this 154 or not? Right? It depends on my level of gran granularity that that I
26:28
want to calculate. Right? So whenever we are working with continuous variables,
26:33
we will always talk about probability of a range.
26:38
All right, probability of a range meaning what is the probability that
26:43
somebody's height is between 152 and 154 cm.
26:48
Also as people who are interested in understanding data, right? Whatever you
26:53
have, say you are interested in ages of people again, right? Somebody could be 2
26:58
minutes younger to me. Right? So how do you quantify age as being discreet,
27:05
right? Your somebody's age could be three uh sorry 32 years, 4 months, 6
27:10
days, 15 hours, right? And therefore age also is a
27:15
continuous variable. But as a as a business owner or an entrepreneur, you
27:20
are okay to find out say what is the probability that somebody who is between
27:25
31 to 33 years of age will buy my product.
27:29
You're fine with that, right? You don't need to know what is the probability
27:34
that somebody that who's 32 years, 6 months, 15 days and so and so that they
27:40
will buy my product. You are okay with ranges, right? And it is fine because
27:46
technically a probability density function also never allows me to
27:50
calculate probability of a single point. So if someone ever asks you what is the
27:56
probability that your shipping will happen in 10 days,
28:01
what is it? Zero.
28:06
Based on this normal curve, probability of shipping happening in 10 days or
28:11
probability that somebody who is 32 years of age exactly will buy your
28:17
product is zero. Because what does this 32 mean? Does this 32 mean somebody who
28:22
has their birthday in birthday in 6 hours and will turn 32? Does this 32
28:27
mean that somebody who has completed 32 years exactly to the minute and then
28:32
they're 6 months past it? Right? You can't be sure. Continuous variables have
28:37
that trickiness to them. So whenever somebody asks you what is the
28:41
probability of a point for a continuous variable, it is zero.
28:47
Okay. So that is what probability density functions help you with. So
28:52
technically this is not the probability. The way you will calculate the
28:57
probability of something will be with ranges. Say for example
29:03
if say this was the distribution of shipping times and your mean shipping
29:07
time is 10 and you want to know what is the probability that my product will be
29:13
delivered in 10 days or less right if whether the supplier will deliver to me
29:19
before the mean mean shipping time. You simply sum the area under the curve.
29:27
Right? So probability density functions tell you probability allow you to
29:31
calculate probability by calculating area under the curve. So this is
29:36
essentially probability density on y-axis is probability per unit length.
29:46
Right? And so some of you who would have done some math at high school level
29:50
technically you would know and if you don't know then take my word for it that
29:55
when you have something like that this essentially means probability by
29:59
whatever length right so what you then have to do to
30:04
calculate probability is multiply length right that's what will give you
30:09
probability here right this
30:14
is what this is area right this is area under the curve
30:19
this into whatever length whatever range I'm interested in whatever range I'm
30:25
interested in to look at to calculate the probability right say I'm interested
30:29
in finding out if my mean probability of delivery time was 10 days what is the
30:35
probability that the product will be shipped to me between 2 to 3 days
30:40
right even on your websites when you when you make sales Right to your
30:45
customer you will say that your product will be shipped in 3 to five business
30:49
days. How are you making that claim 3 to five business days that that is coming
30:54
from here? You will look at the spread of the
30:58
supply times of your supplier right and then you will look at the
31:03
probability of shipping between 3 to 5 days. And if 90% of the times or 95% of
31:09
the times your supplier ships between 3 to 5 days, you're comfortable making
31:14
that claim, would you make that claim if your
31:17
supplier only shipped in 3 to 5 days 50% of the times?
31:22
No. Then it's a wrong claim, right? Technically, it's bad customer service,
31:27
right? So you will essentially figure out what the average supply time is and
31:33
then you will calculate the probabilities of a supply window and
31:37
that is what you will tell your customers that please expect your
31:40
product to reach you in 8 to 10 business days or please expect your product to be
31:45
shipped in 3 to 5 business days. Right? All of that is coming from here.
31:51
Now how it happens? How much time do we have?
31:58
Okay. Oh, sorry. So, this is what the
32:04
probability density function looks like for a
32:08
normal curve. Okay. Now, yeah,
32:20
you gotus you just
32:25
The probability of a continuous variable is always zero.
32:28
The probability of a singular point in a continuous variable is zero.
32:34
Okay. So say if I if I had the spread of ages of my customers, right? So what is
32:41
the probability that my customer is exactly 32 years of age? I can't say
32:46
because what does 32 mean? Does 32 mean somebody who has so say for example my
32:54
birthday is 3rd March right I don't know I think I was born at like morning 2:00
32:59
or something so if it is 3rd March 2 p.m. am I 32 or not
33:08
if I was born I was born on 3rd March 2 a.m. Okay. So the moment that I'm born,
33:15
right? If I 32 years after I was born, technically I turn 32 on 3rd March 2
33:22
a.m., right? So if I wanted to calculate the probability of me buying your
33:28
product, right? And you want to see whether I'm 32 years of age or not. What
33:32
does 32 years even mean? So say if you are looking at me on 3rd March but at 2
33:38
p.m. in the afternoon am I still 32 or have I crossed that age
33:45
something point something right so technically for
33:48
a continuous variable which is age for a continuous variable you can never be
33:54
sure at what point you are measuring
33:59
right what does probability of your customer being 32 years of age even mean
34:04
who qualifies as being 32 years of age old, right? Is somebody 32.00003
34:13
years, 32 years of age or not? Is somebody 31.99996799?
34:21
Is this person 32 or not? Can you calculate the somebody's age to
34:28
this granularity? Technically, no. But theoretically, yes.
34:34
Right? And therefore because you're not sure what is 32 exactly
34:39
for any continuous variable any continuous variable you will always have
34:44
the probability of this exact point as zero.
34:52
said that the probability of variables
34:58
because technically we can't calculate it,
35:02
right? Probability of an event is never zero. Yes, of course, somebody can say
35:07
if your average supply time was 15 days, you could get the product shipped to you
35:12
after 30 days. Possible, right? But what does that 30 even mean? Is that 30 mean
35:19
uh that you will get the product at 12:00 a.m. sharp? No. You could get it
35:24
at maybe uh 12:00 p.m. in the afternoon and then it's 30.05 days. Does that mean
35:31
is it is it is it now 30 days or 31 days? Right. So 30 days is technically
35:37
an average, right? What you are going to do is calculate the probability of your
35:43
supplier maybe delivering in later than 25 days or later than 30 days.
35:51
Right? And if this probability turns out to be too high, you know this is not a
35:55
reliable supplier. Okay? And if we cannot know like
36:01
32 or 36, then why is it? It is relevant to us because technically
36:07
when we will calculate probabilities I will never ask you or you will never ask
36:13
yourself what is the probability of supplying in 30 days
36:18
right you will always be looking at a range
36:23
okay because theoretically you can't have this is going to be zero
36:31
okay theoretically if I told told you I'm going to show you in a minute how
36:36
actually those probabilities are calculated and it's fairly easy but do
36:40
not make the mistake of thinking that it is probability of 32 somebody being 32
36:45
years of age in your customer pool. No, it is probably going to be something
36:49
like you're going to say what is the probability that my customer is between
36:54
31 to 33 years of age or even 31 to 32 years of age.
37:00
Right? If you want to be really granular in your analysis, right? Say for
37:05
example, if your you have a product for which uh shipping on time is really
37:10
important, right? Something which is perishable.
37:13
Say uh you know there are uh like like boutique chocolates or
37:19
something like that which get ruined really quickly, right? And therefore for
37:23
you it is really important that it gets shipped in one to two days otherwise it
37:27
gets ruined, right? the customer gets a bad product and so you will then look at
37:32
the probability of shipping happening in 2 to 3 days
37:36
because technically what this number doesn't even mean anything
37:41
right be what is 2 days so if say for example I place my order at 9:30 a.m.
37:48
today 17th of October does today means that it's on 19th October 9:30 a.m.
37:55
Exactly. I'll get my product and got it. So I hope this thing is clear. We will
38:02
never talk about specific points. We'll always talk about a range
38:08
for continuous variables. Okay. Now
38:15
the way to calculate probabilities I told you everybody understands right
38:19
probability y-axis is not probability it's probability per unit length or
38:24
probability density which means probability comes to us through area
38:29
under the curve right now if we were mathematicians
38:33
which we are not what we would be doing is anybody knows how to find say if I
38:38
gave you a function how would I calculate area under the curve for this
38:42
function fun. If I gave you a function like this and I
38:49
ask you what is the area under the curve for this function? Anybody knows how we
38:53
could do it? Yes.
38:56
Integrals. Integrals.
38:58
Right. Have you seen these ugly ass stuff?
39:04
Yes. Right. Horrifying.
39:12
Sorry. Isn't the f(x) there?
39:18
No, this is just a function. This is just the probability density function.
39:24
Okay. Now, this probability density function
39:34
we don't want to have to deal with, right?
39:39
we have something I've told by the way this function will lead to this. Okay.
39:43
So if you change like values of x and you settled on like mu2 and sigma 1 and
39:51
you kept changing values of x you will arrive at this bell curve. Okay. So this
39:56
is the functional form of a bell curve. All
40:01
right. We are not going to have to deal with it. So how do we calculate
40:05
probabilities? we have something called the
40:11
zed score. Okay.
40:15
Now what a zed score is I told you right in my bell curve
40:22
technically which is symmetrical about the center this point
40:28
both the halves are identical okay they're mirror images of each other this
40:33
point is mean median and mode
40:40
please remember 90% of statistical analysis or data Data
40:45
analysis is just us making assumptions about what a certain kind of data looks
40:52
like. All right? Why we make assumptions? We have to make
40:55
assumptions. We have no other option because we don't know what the true data
40:59
looks like. Okay? So even though if I gave you a data set today or maybe you
41:05
guys have started running your meta ads, right? Right. So in a couple of weeks
41:09
from now you will know you will have data on how much time if somebody
41:13
clicked on your ad or not. what was their age, what was their gender, how
41:17
much time they spend on your landing page. You would have data like that. And
41:22
if you calculated the basic means, right, measures of central tendency and
41:27
measures of variability, these numbers might be different for you.
41:32
But what you have is what? A sample or a population.
41:39
If you run meta ads today, you you started running meta ads, right?
41:44
Yeah. And when you will have data from those
41:46
meta ads on ages of the profile, age profile of the people who have clicked
41:52
on your ad, whether somebody clicked on your ad or not, how much time they spent
41:56
on your website, the data that you get, is that a sample or a population?
42:02
It's a sample, right? So you don't know what the true population looks like,
42:08
right? So even if your sample shows you that your mean, mode, median are
42:13
different, we're assuming that the true population looks like this.
42:19
I have a question about that. Yeah. So in the bell curve, the midpoint is all
42:25
three. All three.
42:27
Okay, that's our assumption
42:29
that the true population looks like this.
42:33
Okay. So your sample might have these three values different
42:38
but now we are assuming that true population will look like this right
42:44
where this is the mean right and we have something called
42:51
standard deviation which will be
42:56
say standard deviation And
43:03
the way your data will look like on a normal curve is 34%
43:10
of your values will be on either side of the mean
43:16
limited by one standard deviation s. All right. So between your minus one
43:24
standard deviation and next standard deviation. Right? So say for example if
43:27
for my data xbar was 10 and uh standard deviation was three two
43:34
right so then these numbers become x becomes 10 this becomes
43:39
for first standard deviation on the negative side becomes what
43:46
if my standard deviation is two and I'm going minus s minus 2 right 10 - 2
43:53
becomes 8 this becomes 8 this becomes 12
43:57
12. So in your data then 34 + 34 this is
44:03
almost 69 some something some something something right almost 70% of your data
44:08
lies between plus minus one standard deviation remember when we discussed
44:13
variability I told you that 70% of your data lies between the range of your
44:19
standard deviations one standard deviation right that assumption comes
44:24
from bell curve assuming that your data is set along a bell curve curve right
44:30
technically then you would see your n 70% of your data fall between the
44:38
first standard deviation okay remaining data say from first
44:44
standard deviation to second standard deviation so what does this number
44:48
becomeus 2s
44:54
six similar here
44:59
14. So 13.59%
45:04
of the data falls between the first and the second standard deviation on either
45:09
side and then 2.15 between second and third
45:15
standard deviation. Okay.
45:20
So this is what the bell curve looks like. Yes.
45:26
It doesn't have like Yeah. So
45:31
exactly right standard deviation number because we squared rooted remember
45:35
right. So technically it can be plus or minus on either side of the mean.
45:41
Standard deviation essentially tells me if my standard deviation was two it
45:45
could be two units to the left or two units to the right.
45:49
Oh so units units.
45:52
Got it. So two units to the left or two units to the right and 70% of the data
45:57
lies between the four standard deviation plus minus four standard deviation and
46:02
the remaining looks like this. Okay. Now how we've arrived at this is
46:08
we have integrated that crazy looking equation and calculated the area under
46:13
the curve for probabilities. Right? A simple way of doing that is the standard
46:20
normal curve. Okay. We have something called the
46:25
standard normal
46:30
curve. The standard normal curve what it does
46:35
is remember this and my mean was 10.
46:42
What I'm going to do is shift my mean to zero.
46:48
Okay. So a standard normal curve has a mean zero and a standard deviation of
46:56
one sorry standard deviation of one one unit.
47:03
So in my standard normal curve what I do is all of the points all of the data
47:08
points that I have I subtract oh this is X okay sorry this is supposed to be X I
47:16
subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.
47:21
Do you get how this would shift my entire number? All the all the numbers
47:26
in my data for every say for example if my data was 1 4 9 10 14 2 3.
47:36
Right? Can somebody tell me the standard deviation and the mean here?
47:42
Quickly you have the phones. So 1 4 9 10 14 2 3.
47:49
What is the standard deviation? for
47:53
this. Are you sure? I don't know.
47:59
Okay. Assuming that my mean was uh I don't know 10 or eight.
48:06
For which for which these these these?
48:10
That's an example. Yeah.
48:12
Yeah. It's it's an example that I just gave you. I'm giving you an example, but
48:16
somebody needs to tell me the mean and standard deviation for these numbers.
48:28
uh five uh 19 29 uh 38 42 uh 42 43 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 So it's something
48:40
around 6. Yeah. So mean is 6.14
48:45
standard deviation 4.8
48:49
4.8 88. Okay. So now what I'm going to do is for
48:54
each of these numbers I'm going to subtract the mean
49:00
and divide by the standard deviation for each of these numbers. So 4 minus uh
49:07
6.14 by 4.88. And what this is doing for me is
49:13
converting my normal curve into a standard normal curve.
49:19
Right? What I've done is from my data I've taken away the mean, subtracted the
49:25
mean and divided by the standard deviation. So all my points in the data
49:30
now become a ratio of the standard deviation
49:36
right. Do you get what I'm doing?
49:40
No, I don't get it because
49:43
it example on the presentation or not. There is no example on the presentation
49:48
right now. Oh no, this this question we'll do. We'll come to this question.
49:54
I'm just explaining this formula right now. Okay. This formula allows me to
50:01
convert my data into a standard normal curve. A standard normal curve has a
50:06
mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. So if I did this exercise for this
50:14
distribution right I subtracted mean from every value
50:18
and divided by standard deviation subtracted mean divide by standard
50:22
deviation for everything I would get and then I calculated the mean and standard
50:28
deviation I would get a mean zero and a standard deviation of one. You can try
50:32
to do it in Excel. Okay. Now standard normal curves
50:37
very easy to deal with and the reason they're very easy to deal
50:42
with. So mean zero standard deviation one so
50:49
one sorry minus one one how much data here between the two
50:55
between minus one and one how much data will be there
50:59
70%. And how do we arrive at that? For that
51:04
we have something called the Zed table. Zed distribution table or do I have it
51:11
open? Do you see the table?
51:28
Is the table are the numbers clear? a little bit.
51:33
Okay. So when I calculate those numbers
51:40
from this formula, right, I'll just change this
51:47
X - XR by S. What I get is a Z score. A zed score essentially tells you where
51:55
does a data point lie on the standard normal distribution curve.
52:02
All right. So for this example at least can you calculate for the first
52:09
for this first 100 can you calculate the zed score?
52:14
Can you calculate the zed score for 100? If I if so what is the mean value that
52:18
I've given? 1.67
52:24
1.37 67
52:27
So zed is 1.67 for this 80 180
52:42
So we have three zed values. Now what the zed score tell us is where does the
52:50
data point lie in a standard normal distribution?
52:56
Oh minus right now how does the zed score
53:01
help us calculate the probability of something happening? I go to the z
53:06
table. Yeah. So first first was minus 1.67 67
53:13
right so what I do is along the zed table the zed table will have two
53:18
components the negative zed scores and the positive zed score so this is the
53:22
table for negative zed scores and the second page is positive zed scores why
53:26
negative and positive because technically I have made my mean as zero
53:32
right so now some data is lying on the left side of zero some data is lying on
53:37
the right side of the zero right which means now some some some some
53:43
distributions or some data points will have a zed score which is negative right
53:47
so I have a zed score of minus 1.67 I go here okay
53:55
so 1.6 6 essentially is the beginning. Then I look at the second decimal place.
54:01
So every time you will calculate the Z score, you will calculate the Z score
54:04
till two decimal places. Right? So if you're getting something like 679, you
54:10
can round it up to 68. Okay? That's your choice. So if you get
54:16
1.67, I go to 1.6. And then on the first row, I search for 7.
54:24
Okay? So I will So that is the third last column right? I scroll down
54:33
04. And now what this has told me is that
54:39
technically the area to the left of $100
54:46
is 4%. The chances of something happening.
54:53
So what was the what was the question to begin with? What are the chances that
54:56
your Yeah. What are the chances that your
55:01
average order value is less than 100? Right? Always remember the zed score is
55:06
telling you area to the left of the line. Right? So now I have
55:15
the mean value was 150. The standard deviation was 30.
55:23
Right? And I am interested in finding out what are the chances that my prob
55:29
that my average order value will be less than $100.
55:33
And from my table now I found out that in fact the area covered
55:41
at this zore minus 1.67 is 04 0.047. meaning that this area
55:53
is 0.047. Meaning that the probability the
55:58
combined probability of any of these events happening is
56:04
uh 4.7%. Okay. So technically the zed table has
56:12
area under the curve for all standard deviations all zed scores and
56:20
these zed scores are essentially telling you what are the chances of an event
56:26
happening. So if my question was what are the chances that your average order
56:31
value will be less than 100 the chances of that I found out are
56:36
4.7%. If I asked you, what are the chances of
56:42
your order value being between $160 and $180?
56:47
Can you now calculate from the zed scores?
56:51
How would we do that? Always remember zed score is telling you the area to the
56:56
left of the score, right? So if
57:01
I mean if what will be the zed score for 160?
57:05
What will be the zed score? Can somebody do Z score for 160
57:15
one 0.33
57:22
right so I go to the positive side of the
57:26
table now 0.3
57:32
and 0.3 62.9%. So 62.9%
57:38
of the values lie to the left of $160. 62.9%.
57:45
I can make the same calculation for 180. What is the what what is the value for
57:50
180? I think we already have it. It's 63, right?
57:55
Huh? Oh, it's one.
57:59
Can you can you show me what is the um Yeah. So one probability for one is
58:14
84 84%.
58:17
84.13%. So what are the chances of your average
58:23
order value being 160 between 160 and 180?
58:32
Right? 84.13 minus 62.9.
58:39
This is the probability that you will have an average average order value
58:43
between this value these two number between 160 and 180.
58:49
What is the probability that your average order value will be
58:54
more than 170? Can you now do that for me? So
59:00
170 the Z score was 63. Right. So, where do I go on the Z table?
59:07
Positive or the negative side? Positive side. Where do I what what's
59:11
the number that I search in the first column?
59:16
0.6. The first two decimal first decimal
59:21
place, right? So, 0.6. And what do I search in the first row?
59:30
What number do I search for in the first row?
59:34
Seven or three. See three. Sorry. The Z score is 63. You told me that.
59:44
So on the first in the first row I look for 6. Then I find that three this the
59:52
three at the second decimal place in the first row. And wherever they intersect
1:00:00
73 is again 73 is the probability of
1:00:05
something on the left. Right? So if
1:00:15
you told me the Z score of 637 67. Okay. I'm sorry. I must have heard
1:00:22
it wrong. So okay fine. So 67 here. Is that correct?
1:00:30
Yeah. So this has told me the probability of
1:00:36
what 74 is the probability of what? A value being less than 170 or more than
1:00:43
170. Less than 170.
1:00:48
Right? So if this was $170, technically
1:00:55
74 is the sum of all these probabilities.
1:01:00
So what is the probability that your average order value will be more than
1:01:04
170? 1 minus 74.
1:01:14
Right? So now if I told you you are to choose a supplier
1:01:20
right and you okay or maybe you already have a supplier and you have to make a
1:01:25
claim on your website that our product will ship in these many days. What do
1:01:30
you do now? You calculate the probability of a given
1:01:37
range of supply days, shipping days, right? And if that is a good probability
1:01:43
then that is the claim you make on your website
1:01:48
okay that on an average our product will be supplied say you you choose a number
1:01:53
80% of the times I am okay with my sub shipping happening between 3 to 8 days
1:01:59
or 3 to 5 days right you calculate what the probability of that happening is and
1:02:04
if if that probability is greater than 80%. Then that is the supply you go
1:02:09
with, right? Do you understand how the
1:02:13
standard normal curve is going to help me calculate probabilities of specific
1:02:18
events happening? Yeah. Any doubts about zed score?
1:02:29
So if I gave you if I gave you like questions and all in an assignment,
1:02:33
you'll be able to do at least work with zed scores. Do you have this table yet?
1:02:38
This table is easily available on Google but also I will share it with you.
1:02:42
Okay. So this table is like widely used right?
1:02:45
Very widely used for just no. So that's the that's the magic of
1:02:50
the standard normal curve that technically say for example if your you
1:02:56
work with you have your meta ads data and there you find out that the average
1:03:00
age of a customer is 25. Somebody else maybe somebody else could have a meta
1:03:06
ads data where their average age was 32. Both of you can work with the same zed
1:03:11
table because technically you have done this. You've calculated zed scores x -
1:03:18
xar by sigma right and so all of you are working with
1:03:24
the same zed distribution table which is the standard normal curve. You've
1:03:28
standardized that all of your data to this curve.
1:03:32
And now once you have that data, once you have the zed scores for your data,
1:03:36
you can calculate all the probabilities here, all combinations of all ranges.
1:03:42
Okay. Fine.
1:03:47
Thank you.
